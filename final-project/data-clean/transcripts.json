The pace of the recovery in economic\nactivity and employment has moderated in recent months, with weakness concentrated in\nthe sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic.

Overall financial\nconditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the\neconomy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.\nThe path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus,\nincluding progress on vaccinations. The ongoing public health crisis continues to weigh\non economic activity, employment, and inflation, and poses considerable risks to the\neconomic outlook.\nThe Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate\nof 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation running persistently below this longer-\nrun goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for\nsome time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation\nexpectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. The Committee expects to maintain an\naccommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved. The\nCommittee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent\nand expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market\nconditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum\nemployment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed\n2 percent for some time.

    "press_conf": "January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nTranscript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference\nJanuary 27, 2021\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed\nto achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and\nprice stability. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have taken forceful actions to provide\nrelief and stability, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting\ndamage to the economy. Today my colleagues on the FOMC and I kept interest rates near zero\nand maintained our sizable asset purchases. These measures, along with our strong guidance on\ninterest rates and our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to deliver\npowerful support to the economy until the recovery is complete.\nThe path of the economy continues to depend significantly on the course of the virus. A\nresurgence in recent months in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths is causing great\nhardship for millions of Americans and is weighing on economic activity and job creation.\nFollowing a sharp rebound in economic activity last summer, the pace of the recovery has\nmoderated in recent months, with the weakness concentrated in the sectors of the economy most\nadversely affected by the resurgence of the virus and by greater social distancing. Household\nspending on services remains low, especially in sectors that typically require people to gather\nclosely, including travel and hospitality. And household spending on goods has moderated\nfollowing earlier large gains.\nIn contrast, the housing sector has more than fully recovered from the downturn,\nsupported in part by low mortgage interest rates. Business investment and manufacturing\nproduction have also picked up. The overall recovery in economic activity since last spring is\ndue in part to federal stimulus payments and expanded unemployment benefits, which have\nprovided essential support to many families and individuals. The recently enacted Coronavirus\nPage 1 of 28\nJanuary 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nResponse and Relief Act [Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021] will provide additional\nsupport. Overall economic activity remains below its level before the pandemic, and the path\nahead remains highly uncertain.\nAs with overall economic activity, the pace of improvement in the labor market has\nslowed in recent months. Employment fell by 140,000 in December, as continued gains in many\nindustries were outweighed by significant losses in industries where the resurgence of the virus\nhas weighed further on activity. In particular, the leisure and hospitality sector lost nearly half a\nmillion jobs, largely from restaurants and bars. The unemployment rate remained elevated at\n6.7 percent in December, and participation in the labor market is notably below pre-pandemic\nlevels. Although there has been much progress in the labor market since the spring, millions of\nAmericans remain out of work. The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans,\nand those least able to shoulder the burden have been the hardest hit. In particular, the high level\nof joblessness has been especially severe for lower-wage workers in the service sector and for\nAfrican Americans and Hispanics. The economic dislocation has upended many lives and\ncreated great uncertainty about the future.\nThe pandemic has also left a significant imprint on inflation. Following large declines in\nthe spring, consumer prices picked up over the summer but have leveled out more recently. For\nthose sectors that have been most adversely affected by the pandemic, prices remain particularly\nsoft. Overall, on a 12-month basis, inflation remains below our 2 percent longer-run objective.\nWhile we should not underestimate the challenges we currently face, several\ndevelopments point to an improved outlook for later this year. Sufficiently widespread\nvaccinations would enable us to put the pandemic behind us and return to more normal economic\nactivities. In the meantime, continued observance of social-distancing measures and wearing\nPage 2 of 28\nJanuary 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nmasks will help us reach that goal as soon as possible. Support from fiscal policy will help\nhouseholds and businesses weather the downturn as well as limit lasting damage to the economy\nthat could otherwise impede the recovery. In addition, as we have seen since last summer, the\neconomy has proved more resilient than expected, in part reflecting the adaptability of\nhouseholds and businesses. Finally, monetary policy is playing a key role in supporting the\nrecovery and will continue to do so.\nThe Fed’s response to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to\npromote the stability of the financial system. Today we unanimously reaffirmed our Statement\non Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, as we typically do each January. As we say\nin that statement, we view maximum employment as a “broad-based and inclusive goal.” Our\nability to achieve maximum employment in the years ahead depends importantly on having\nlonger-term inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent.\nAs the Committee reiterated in today’s policy statement, with inflation running\npersistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for\nsome time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations\nremain well anchored at 2 percent. We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary\npolicy until these employment and inflation outcomes are achieved. With regard to interest rates,\nwe continue to expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range\nfor the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the\nCommittee’s assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on\ntrack to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In addition, we will continue to increase our\nholdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed\nPage 3 of 28\nJanuary 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nsecurities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made\ntoward our maximum-employment and price-stability goals. The increase in our balance sheet\nsince last March has materially eased financial conditions and is providing substantial support to\nthe economy. The economy is a long way from our employment and inflation goals, and it is\nlikely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved.\nOur forward guidance for the federal funds rate, along with our balance sheet guidance,\nwill ensure that the stance of monetary policy remains highly accommodative as the recovery\nprogresses. Our guidance is outcome based and ties the path of the federal funds rate and the\nbalance sheet to progress toward reaching our employment and inflation goals. Thus, if progress\ntoward our goals were to slow, the guidance would convey our intention to increase policy\naccommodation through a lower expected path of the federal funds rate and a higher expected\npath of the balance sheet. Overall, our interest rate and balance sheet tools are providing\npowerful support to the economy and will continue to do so.\nWe’ve also taken actions to more directly support the flow of credit in the economy,\ndeploying our emergency lending powers to an unprecedented extent, enabled in large part by\nfinancial backing and support from Congress and the Treasury. Although the CARES Act\nfacilities are no—are no longer open to new activity, our other facilities remain in place.\nTo conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses\nacross the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We are committed to\nusing our full range of tools to support the economy and to help assure that the recovery from\nthis difficult period will be as robust as possible. Thank you. I look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Jeanna Smialek.\nPage 4 of 28\nJanuary 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Chair Powell. Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times.\nThank you for taking our questions. I was hoping that you would first react to the wild ride that\ngame stock—GameStop’s stock has had this week. And then, secondarily, you and your\ncolleagues have repeatedly made it clear that you really plan to use macroprudential tools as the\nfirst line of defense when it comes to financial stability risks. But your macroprudential tools\nprimarily apply to the banks. I’m wondering what your plan is, if you see some sort of large\nfinancial stability risk emanating from the nonbank financial sector in the coming months,\nespecially as it relates to search-for-yield kind of activities. You know, what, what do you see as\nthe solution there? Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. So, on, on your first question, I don’t want to comment on a\nparticular company or, or day’s market activity or things like that. It’s just not really something\nthat I would typically comment on.\nIn terms of macroprudential policy tools, so, as you know, no doubt, we rely on sort of\nalways-on, through-the-cycle macroprudential policy tools, particularly the stress tests and also\nthe elevated levels of liquidity and capital and, and, and also resolution planning that we—that\nwe impose on the largest financial institutions. We don’t use time-varying tests and tools as\nsome other countries do. And we think it’s a good approach because—for us to use ones that are\nalways-on—because we don’t really think we’d be successful in every case in picking the exact\nright time to intervene in markets. So that’s for banks.\nYou really asked about nonbanks, the nonbank sector. And so we monitor financial\nconditions very broadly. And while we don’t have jurisdiction over, over many areas in the\nnonbank sector, other agencies do. And so we do coordinate through the Financial Stability\nOversight Council and with other agencies who have responsibility for, for nonbank supervision.\nPage 5 of 28\nJanuary 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nAnd, in fact, as you know, in the last crisis, the banking system held up fairly well so far. And,\nand the dislocations that we saw from the outsized economic and financial shock of the\npandemic really appeared in the nonbank sector. So that’s—right now we are engaged in, in\ncarefully examining, understanding, and thinking about what, what in the nonbank sector will\nneed to be addressed in the next year or so.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. James Politi, FT.\nJAMES POLITI. Thank you so much, Michelle and Chair Powell. I had a question on\nfiscal policy. Last year you consistently said that the economy needed more fiscal support and, I\nbelieve, were pleased when the $900 billion package was approved in December. We have—\nnow have a new, new President, a new Congress. We have a weakening short-term outlook. Do\nyou believe the economy still needs additional support on the fiscal side? And in what areas?\nCHAIR POWELL. Thank you. So I guess I’d start by saying that the, the fiscal response\nthat we’ve seen to this downturn has been strong, and I think we can say now that it’s been\nsustained after the passage of the—of the, the most recent act in, in late December. And that’s\nreally a key reason why the recovery has been as strong as it’s been. Fiscal policy has been\nabsolutely essential. When we look back on, on the history of this period, we’ll see a strong and\nsustained fiscal policy response.\nI would—I would add that we’re, as I mentioned, a long way from a full recovery.\nSomething like 9 million people remain unemployed as a consequence of the pandemic. That’s\nas many people as lost their jobs at the peak of the Global Financial Crisis and the Great\nRecession. Many small businesses are under pressure, and there are other needs to be addressed.\nAnd the path ahead is still pretty uncertain.\nPage 6 of 28\nJanuary 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nSo, all of that said, the judgment on how much to spend and in what way is really one for\nCongress and the Administration and not for the Fed. And these discussions are going on right\nnow. So there’s a discussion, as you know, right now around, around those precise questions,\nand, and that’s appropriate, but not for us to play a role in talking about specific policies.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Steve Liesman.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I wonder if I could follow up on\nJeanna’s question here. I understand that you do address issues of, of valuations through\nmacroprudential policies in the first instance, but there’s a range of assets. And I know you do\nwatch a range of assets. But from Bitcoin to corporate bonds to the stock market in general to\nsome of these more specific meteoric rises in stocks like GameStop, how do you address the\nconcern that super easy monetary policy—asset purchases and zero interest rates—are\npotentially fueling a bubble that could cause economic fallout should it burst?\nCHAIR POWELL. Let me—let me provide a little context. The shock that the—from\nthe pandemic was unprecedented both in its nature and in its size and in the amount of\nunemployment that it created and in the shock to economic activity. There’s nothing close to it\nin our modern economic history. So our response was really to that. And we—we’ve done what\nwe could, first, to restore market function and to provide a bit of relief, then to support the\nrecovery. And, hopefully, we’ll be able to do the third thing, which is to avoid longer-run\ndamage to the—to the economy.\nOur role assigned by Congress is maximum employment and stable prices and also look\nafter financial stability. So, in a world where, almost a year later, we’re, we’re still 9 million\njobs, at least—that’s one way of counting it; it can actually be counted much higher than that—\nshort of maximum employment and people are out of the labor force who were in the labor\nPage 7 of 28\nJanuary 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nforce—the real unemployment rate is close to 10 percent if you include people that’ve left the\nlabor force—it’s very much appropriate that monetary policy be highly accommodative to\nsupport maximum employment and price stability, which is getting inflation back to 2 percent\nand averaging 2 percent over time.\nSo, on, on matters of financial stability, we have a framework. We don’t look at one\nthing or two things. We look at—and we made that framework public after the financial crisis so\nthat it could be criticized and understood and we could be held accountable. And, you know, the\nthings that we look at are—we do look at asset prices. We also look at leverage in the banking\nsystem. We look at leverage in the non—the nonbanking system, which is to say, corporates and\nhouseholds. And we look at also funding risk. And if you look at it across that range of, of, of\nreadings, they’re each different, but we monitor them carefully. And I would say that financial\nstability vulnerabilities overall are moderate.\nOur overall goal is to assure that the financial system itself is resilient to, to shocks of all\nkinds, that it’s strong and resilient. And that includes not just the banks, but money market funds\nand, and all different kinds of nonbank financial structures as well. So when we get to the\nnonfinancial sector, we don’t—we don’t have jurisdiction over that.\nBut—so I would just say that our—that there are many things that go in, as you know, to,\nto setting asset prices. So if you look at what’s really been driving asset prices, really, in the last\ncouple of months, it isn’t monetary policy. It’s been expectations about vaccines. And it’s also\nfinancial—sorry, fiscal policy. Those are—those are the news items that have been driving,\ndriving asset purchases—sorry, asset values in, in recent months.\nSo I, I know that monetary policy does play a role there, but that’s how we look at it.\nAnd I think, you know, I think that the connection between low interest rates and, and asset\nPage 8 of 28\nJanuary 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nvalues is probably something that’s not as tight as people think, because a lot of—a lot of\ndifferent factors are driving asset prices at any given time.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Can I follow up, Michelle, if you don’t mind? Mr. Chairman, do\nyou rule out or see as one of your tools in the toolkit the idea of adjusting monetary policy to\naddress asset values?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, you know, that’s—as you know, that’s one of the very difficult\nquestions in all of monetary policy. And we don’t rule it out as a theoretical matter, but we, we\nclearly look to macroprudential tools, regulatory tools, supervisory tools, other kinds of tools\nrather than monetary policy in, in addressing financial stability issues. It’s not—you know, the,\nthe monetary policy we know strengthens economic activity and job creation through fairly well-\nunderstood channels. And a strong economy is actually a great supporter of financial stability.\nThat will mean strong, you know, well-capitalized institutions, and, and households will be—\nwill be working. And, and so we know that.\nWe don’t actually understand the tradeoff between—the sense of it is, would you—if you\nraise interest rates and thereby tighten financial conditions and reduce economic activity now in\norder to address asset bubbles and things like that, what—will that even help? Will it—will it\nactually cause more damage, or will it help? So I think that’s unresolved. And I, I think it’s, it’s\nsomething we, we look at as not, not theoretically ruled out but not something we, we—we’ve\never done and not something we would plan to do. We would rely on macroprudential and other\ntools to deal with financial stability issues.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Michael Derby.\nPage 9 of 28\nJanuary 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMICHAEL DERBY. Yes. Thank you very much. I wanted to ask you, if there is a near-\nterm rise in inflation related to the recovery, how will you determine whether or not it’s\nsomething that’s temporary or more enduring? And how much inflation is the Fed willing to\ntolerate before it acts to restrain price pressures?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, on inflation, a couple of things—there are a couple of things that\nare worth mentioning. One is just that we know that we measure inflation on a trailing 12-month\nbasis. And as we—as we lap the very low inflation readings of March and April of last year,\nwe’ll see measured 12-month inflation move up a few tenths. This is just—they’re called base\neffects, and, and that’s a—that’s a transient thing that we think will pass.\nThere’s also the possibility—indeed, it’s in some forecasts—that as the economy fully\nreopens, there’ll be a burst of spending, and—because people will be enthusiastic that the\npandemic is over, potentially, and that that could also create some upward pressure on inflation.\nNow, again, we would see that as something likely to be transient and not to be very large. In\nboth cases, we don’t see those as either lasting or particularly large. So the way we would react\nis, we’re going to be patient. Expect us to wait and see and not react if we see small and what we\nwould review—we would view as very likely to be transient effects on inflation.\nI think if you—you know, it helps to look back at, at the inflation dynamics that the\nUnited States has had now for some decades and notice that there has been, you know,\nsignificant disinflationary pressure for some time, for a couple of decades. Inflation has\naveraged less than 2 percent for a quarter of a century. And the inflation dynamics, with the flat\nPhillips curve and low persistence of inflation, is very much intact. Those things, they change\nover time. We understand that inflation dynamics evolve constantly over time, but they don’t\nPage 10 of 28\nJanuary 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nchange rapidly. So we think it’s very unlikely that anything we see now would result in, you\nknow, troubling inflation.\nOf course, if we did get sustained inflation at a level that was uncomfortable, we have\ntools for that. It’s far harder to deal with, with too low inflation. We know what to do with\nhigher inflation, which is, you know, should the need arise, we, we would have those tools. And\nwe don’t expect to see that at all.\nIn terms of how much, you know, what we’ve said is we’d like to see—because inflation\nhas been running persistently below 2 percent, we’d like to see it run moderately above 2 percent\nfor some time. We have not adopted a formula. We’re not going to adopt a formula. We’re\ngoing to—we, we use policy rules and formulas in everything we do, consult them constantly,\nbut we don’t set policy by them. We don’t do that. And so we’re going to preserve an element\nof judgment.\nAnd, again, we’ll seek inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time. And we’ll,\nwe’ll show what that means when we get inflation above 2 percent. The, the way to achieve\ncredibility on that is to actually do it. And so that’s what we’re planning on doing.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Rachel Siegel.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Thank you, Michelle, and thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our\nquestions. I have a two-pronged question about vaccines. So you specifically mentioned\nprogress in the rollout of vaccines, but there is still plenty that we don’t know about supply over\nthe coming weeks and months. So I’m curious how you and your colleagues are factoring in\nvaccine rollouts and funding for distribution in your forecasts and what that timeline looks like.\nAnd then, secondly, I’m wondering if you, yourself haven’t—has been—have been\nvaccinated, along with other FOMC members. Thank you.\nPage 11 of 28\nJanuary 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. So, in terms of the rollout of the vaccines, we see what everyone else\nsees, right? We see that we’re, we’re vaccinating people and at a rate of about a million a day,\napparently, and that it’ll take quite a while to get—to get to the numbers that the experts say are\nrequired to get to herd immunity. And we think it’s going to be a struggle.\nYou’ll notice that we, we said that the, the pandemic still, still provides considerable\ndownside risks to the economy. And that’s one of the reasons why, is that—is the slowness of\nthe rollout. The other—another reason why is just the arrival of these new virus strains. We\ndon’t know how to—we don’t know how to model that. You know, we can have a base case, but\nwe realize no one knows how the—how this new vaccine will roll out, how successful it will be,\nhow high we’ll be able to drive vaccination, and those sorts of things.\nSo we have a base case, and we—but we always—we always look at, at the range of\npossibilities. In this case, we particularly look at the downside risks. You know, that’s really\nwhat we do is, we, we set policies so that we’re, we’re, you know, we’re going to remain\naccommodative until we actually see improvement in the economy and not just in the outlook, in\nthe data. So that’s, that’s how we think about, about that.\nAnd I would—I would also add, there’s nothing more important to the economy now\nthan, than people getting vaccinated. You know, if you—if you, you think about the places\nwhere the economy is weak—I mentioned bars and restaurants. That’s 400,000 jobs we lost last\nmonth, and that’s all because of the spread of the pandemic. Many other areas of the economy—\nactually, there was actually job creation in—you know, in goods production and in some service\nparts—industries as well. But we’re just not going to be able to get that last group of people\nback to work—and it’s a big group of people—until we get the pandemic behind us.\nPage 12 of 28\nJanuary 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nWe, we have not won this yet. We haven’t succeeded in doing this yet, and we need to\nstay focused on it as a country and, and get there. And, you know, we clearly can, but we’re\ngoing to have to stay focused. And that includes—you know, that includes us at the Fed,\nmonetary policy.\nI, I have been vaccinated once, and I expect to get my second vaccine sometime soon.\nThank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Michael McKee.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. A question—I have a question that I was going to ask, but I need\nto follow up for a second on the questions about the markets and macroprudential, and that is,\nyou have one tool you can use. Would you be discussing—have you discussed raising margin\nrequirements under Regulation T? And, if not, why not?\nCHAIR POWELL. No, we haven’t—we haven’t done that. I mean, remember, we’re,\nwe’re focused on maximum employment, price stability, financial stability as I defined it—the\nbroad financial sector. And, and that—that’s not, you know—over the years, we, we consult the\nfact that we have that authority. But, no, it’s not something we’re looking at right now at all.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. All right. My follow-up question is, a lot of people in the markets\nthink that you’re basically stuck right now, because you can’t really go lower with the zero\nbound, rejecting negative interest rates, and you can’t really go higher because of the threat of a\ntaper tantrum. Is the Fed locked into a very narrow corridor now? And, if not, you did say you\nwould signal any change in interest rates a long time ahead. But [former] New York Fed\nPresident Bill Dudley says there’s no way you can avoid a taper tantrum. So how do you do\nthat?\nPage 13 of 28\nJanuary 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, first, I—we, we think our policy stance is, is just right. We\nthink it’s providing significant support for economic activity and hiring. We, you know, we, we\nadopted a new monetary policy framework of flexible average inflation targeting in August. In\nSeptember, we, we implemented rate guidance that, that was consistent with and based on that\nnew framework. In December, we did the same for asset purchases.\nSo we now have, you know, strong guidance on, on rates and on asset purchases that’s\nproviding very strong support for economic activity. If you look at the sectors of the economy\nthat are interest sensitive, you will see very strong activity: housing, durable goods, automobile\nsales. So, you know, our, our policies are working. And we think that, that they are—we think\nour policy stance is, is right.\nThat said, there’s clearly more that we can do. With asset purchases, for example, we\ncan, you know—that’s, that’s a tool we can do more—we can strengthen our guidance, too, if we\nwere to think that that were appropriate. What you see is an economy where what’s holding it\nback is not the lack of, of policy support from the Fed. It’s the pandemic. It’s, it’s the spread of\nthe disease and people’s reluctance or, or inability to partake in certain kinds of economic\nactivities, which amount to a, a meaningful part of the economy. So that’s, that’s what I would\nsay. We certainly have things that we can do, but we think we’re—we think we’re in the\nright place.\nYou know, in terms of—in terms of tapering, it’s just premature. We just created the, the\nguidance. We said we’d want to see substantial further progress toward our goals before we\nmodify our, our asset purchase guidance. It’s just too early to be talking about dates, which we\nshould be focused on, on progress. We’ll need to see actual progress. And when, when we see\nourselves getting to that point, we’ll communicate clearly about it to, to the public so nobody\nPage 14 of 28\nJanuary 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nwill be surprised when the time comes. And we’ll do that well in advance of actually\nconsidering what will be a pretty gradual taper.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Well, if I might, you—your policies are working, and you can\nmaybe do more. But the question is, can you stop doing it when it’s time?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes. So, you know, I, I was here—we had all the same questions\nback in—after the Global Financial Crisis. We raised interest rates. We froze the balance sheet\nsize, and then we shrank the balance sheet size. So there’s no reason why we, we won’t be able\nto do that again. In fact, we learned a lot from that experience.\nAnd, you know, we, we understand—as we understood then, but even more so—we\nunderstand that the—that the way to do it is to communicate well in advance, to, to do\npredictable things, and to move gradually. And that’s, that’s what we’re going to do. We’re\ngoing to be very transparent.\nBut, honestly, no—you know, the whole focus on exit is premature, if I may say. We’re\nfocused on finishing the job we’re doing, which is to support the economy, to give the economy\nthe support it needs. There are people out there who’ve lost their jobs. It’s essential that we get\nthem back to work as quickly as possible, and we want to do everything we can to do that. And\nthat is our primary focus right now. It’s, it’s, it’s too soon to be—to be worried about that. You\nknow, when we come to exit, we have a—we have an understanding of how to do that, and we’ll\ndo it very carefully. But in the meantime, our focus is on giving the economy the support\nit needs.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Victoria Guida.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Chair Powell. I just wanted to go back to fiscal stimulus for a\nsecond. You know, we just had a $900 billion package, and now Congress is talking about doing\nPage 15 of 28\nJanuary 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nmore. Do you expect more aid directly to consumers to be inflationary? And, specifically, how\nworried should lawmakers be about, you know, causing concerning levels of inflation?\nCHAIR POWELL. I, I would say that, again, we have been struggling with\ndisinflationary forces for some time. If you look around the world—look in Western Europe,\nlook at Japan—around the world, large economies have, have felt much more downward\npressure on inflation, have fallen short of their inflation goals, for some time now. That is the\nbroad global macroeconomic context that we all live in.\nAnd we believe that those global forces—which are, you know, aging demographics,\nadvancing technology, and globalization—those, those forces are still in effect. Now, they may\nslow down, and, and it’s, it’s an interesting question, the extent to which, for example,\nglobalization may slow down or even reverse. Notwithstanding that, inflation dynamics in the\nUnited States have, have consisted of a flat Phillips curve and low persistence for, for a long\ntime. We do not expect in the near term that that will change significantly. It may evolve over\ntime, but significant time. You know, these things are—these things are, are changing, but they\ndon’t change at a rapid rate. And there’s—I, I don’t believe that, that they will.\nSo I wouldn’t—I’m, I’m not—I’m much more worried about falling short of a complete\nrecovery and losing people’s careers and lives that they—that they built because they don’t get to\nwork—back to work in time and things like that. I’m more concerned about that and the damage\nthat will do not just to their lives, but to the United States economy, to the productive capacity of\nthe economy. I’m more concerned about that than about the possibility, which exists, of higher\ninflation. Frankly, we welcome slightly higher inflation, somewhat higher inflation. The kind of\ntroubling inflation that people like me grew up with seems, seems far away and unlikely in, in\nthe both domestic and global context that we’ve been in for some time.\nPage 16 of 28\nJanuary 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Steve Matthews, Bloomberg.\nSTEVE MATTHEWS. Chair Powell, Treasury Secretary Yellen, in a memo to her\nemployees yesterday, spoke of the close working relationship with the Federal Reserve. And I’m\nwondering how you would describe the relationship with, with Treasury under Chair Yellen, if\nyou’ve met with, with, with Treasury Secretary Yellen and, and/or President Biden since he has\ntaken office.\nAnd, you know, secondly, about that, as you know, in the last four years, there was\nconstant criticism from the—of the Fed from the President and from other officials of the\nAdministration. Do you have any kind of assurance or expectation that this will now be more of\na hands-off attitude, in terms of commenting on monetary policy from the Administration?\nCHAIR POWELL. Okay. So I have the highest respect and admiration for Secretary\nYellen. And I’m, I’m sure that we’re going to have a, a good working relationship together.\nAbsolutely sure. We’ll also have a good institutional relationship between the Fed and the\nTreasury. And I expect that that’ll be very good and, and very productive. It’ll be collaborative.\nWe’ll work together.\nNow, the way that works is, is that, you know, we know—the agencies know each other\nwell, and this is true of finance ministries and central banks around the world. We know to stay\nin our lanes. We know we have different authorities. We know that we work together on some\nthings to—you know, for the benefit of the public. And I’m, I’m absolutely sure that we’re\ngoing to do that.\nI, you know, haven’t—I haven’t spoken to, to Secretary Yellen—I’m going to be calling\nher “Chair Yellen” most of the time, so you just have to be patient with me—Secretary Yellen. I\nhaven’t spoken to her since I congratulated her on being nominated. I do expect very soon to\nPage 17 of 28\nJanuary 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nbegin our regular calls or—and, and ultimately meetings, which have gone on, really, for, you\nknow, 70 years. The Treasury Secretary and the, and the Fed Chair have had weekly or so\nmeetings, lunches, breakfast, calls, depending on the situation. So I expect that will—that will\nhappen soon.\nI’ve—I have not met the, the President, President Biden. And just, you know, I, I,\nI don’t—I don’t have any comment on your—on your last question. I wouldn’t want to\ncomment one way or the other.\nSTEVE MATTHEWS. Just to follow up briefly, you have some 13(3) emergency\nprograms that will expire March 31 that the Fed and the Treasury have worked on together. Do\nyou have an expectation of whether those will be left, left to expire then or whether they will be\nextended?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I—I’ll just say that I think our facilities were very successful in\nsupporting the economy during its darkest moments and I believe saved—protected the loss of\nmillions of jobs. We’re going to continue to monitor financial and credit conditions throughout\nthe economy. And, and if the kind of emergency conditions arise that are required under that\nlaw, then our emergency lending tools will remain available.\nNow, I’ve had no discussions with anybody at Treasury on that, because I haven’t had\nany discussions with anybody at Treasury other than meet—you know, high-level meetings with\nthe—with the transition team a month or so ago. And once we start having those, those\nmeetings, of course, I’ll observe, you know, the long-standing practice of not talking about\nconfidential discussions. But as of now, there haven’t been any discussions at all.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Howard Schneider, Reuters.\nPage 18 of 28\nJanuary 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thanks, Chair Powell, for doing this. So a couple questions\non timing. In the statement, you removed—regarding the coronavirus—you removed the time\nreference “short and medium term” when it comes to the risks to the economic outlook, and it\nsimply now says “considerable risks to the economic outlook.” Should we read that as a sort of a\npositive change that you, you now see an end—sort of the endgame of this down the road? Or is\nit more that you’re, you’re worried it could last longer than you expect? And a related issue,\nhave you given any guidance yet to the Fed staff or System on when the Fed itself might resume\nin-person events?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes. So in the statement, on the language, we dropped “in the\nmedium term,” because, really, the risks are, are in the near term, frankly. You know, as I\nmentioned, it’s the rollout of the vaccine. It’s the arrival of new strains that, that are more\ncontagious and perhaps more virulent. And those are the—those are the—and also just the\nongoing—third thing, of course, is the ongoing spread of the virus. It’s, it’s in the near term. It’s\nnot in the medium term. We were thinking—when we were thinking “medium term,” we were\nthinking of longer-term scarring and things like that.\nNonetheless, I mean, I think what—to go to your, your second question, and as I\nmentioned in my, in my opening remarks—there is good evidence to, to support a stronger\neconomy in the second half of this year. In fact, if you look at, at—as we do—look at a range of\nprivate forecasters, what was their forecast in, in December, and what’s their forecast now?\nRight across the board: much higher forecasts for 2021 growth. And that’s because of the\nongoing rollout of the vaccines and also because of fiscal policy, expectations, and the reality of,\nof the CRRA Act [Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021] getting done. So there is—there is a\npositive case there.\nPage 19 of 28\nJanuary 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nBut that—think of that as—the sort of base case is, is a strong economy in the second half\nof the year. The language says that there’s still—I forget the exact language—downside risks.\nWe used an adjective. It was “considerable”—“considerable risks to the economic outlook.” So\nthere are considerable risks, risks to the economic outlook. Nonetheless, that is—that is a more\npositive outlook. And that’s really how, how I would—I would parse that for you.\nI don’t know when we’re going to come back to work, and I’m, I’m actually in the Eccles\nBuilding here today. And I don’t know when that’ll be. I mean, we—I can’t wait to be working\nin person again. But, you know, we—we’ve been able to work successfully remotely. We really\nhave. And, you know, we’re not going to push people when they’re uncomfortable. We’re\ngoing to wait till people are comfortable and wait till it’s well and truly time to get back together\nin person.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Hannah Lang.\nHANNAH LANG. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you so much for taking our questions. The\nFed in December eased its restrictions on bank dividend payments and share repurchases. And\nso I wanted to ask what factors the Fed will be looking at to determine what level banks can pay\nout in the second quarter and when we can expect such a decision.\nCHAIR POWELL. Okay. So we’re, we’re monitoring that on an ongoing basis,\ncontinue to—continuing to evaluate our, our restrictions. And we haven’t made a decision about\nwhether to continue them in the second quarter or not. We’re just going to look at bank—we’re\ngoing to look at the whole range of, of information, including economic activity, banking\nactivity, the, the success in vaccination. All of those things will go into our assessment of what\nthe right answer is to that question.\nPage 20 of 28\nJanuary 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nI think we’ve been careful about, about rolling back those restrictions. And, and I’m\npleased with where we are. Let’s remember that the banks—that the banks that are subject to the\nstress tests have taken very, very large reserves—very large loss reserves, and also increased\ntheir capital. They’ve actually had—they have higher capital ratios now than they had at the\nbeginning of the pandemic. So the banking system has held up well here. And, and—but, you\nknow, we’re going to be careful about this and, you know, move based on data, and all of the\ndata, when we make that decision.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Edward Lawrence.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Mr. Chairman, thank you for taking the question. So I’m\ninterested in the housing sector. Home prices are rising, 9 percent in some areas, because of low\ninterest rates. Are you concerned about a bubble forming there yet? And is there a price\nincrease, you know, that you’re looking at where it might change the level of mortgage-backed\nsecurities the Fed is buying? And, as a continuation of that, is the bubble in the corporate debt\ncycle more concerning for you?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, on housing, you know, housing is now—the level of housing\nactivity is at its highest level since before the Global Financial Crisis, in some measures. So\nwe’ve had a very strong rebound in housing. Some of the, the tightness in housing markets, we\nthink—which has led to the, the significant price increases this year—we think is, is a passing\nphenomenon. There was a lot of pent-up demand.\nThere’s a one-time thing happening with people who are spending all of their time in\ntheir house, and they’re thinking either “I need a bigger house” or “I need another house and a\ndifferent house—or a second house,” in some cases. So there’s just—there’s a—there’s a one-\ntime shift in demand that we think will get satisfied—also, that will call forth supply. And that\nPage 21 of 28\nJanuary 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nwill—that will, we think—we think that those price increases are unlikely to be sustained for, for\nall of those reasons.\nSo you asked about corporate debt, I guess?\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Yes. I’m just concerned if that’s a bubble that you’re\nwatching.\nCHAIR POWELL. So we, we monitor pretty much all of the big financial markets pretty\ncarefully. And, you know, what’s happened in, in the corporate debt market, beginning with the\nannouncement of our corporate credit facility, has been, you’ve seen lenders lending and\nborrowers borrowing. You’ve seen relatively significantly fewer defaults than we—than we\nexpected. There were a lot of downgrades and some defaults at the beginning, and those have\nreally slowed down.\nAnd, by the way, the same is true for bank loans. Banks are not experiencing the kinds of\ndefaults that, that we all were concerned about in the early months of the pandemic. It’s just not\nmaterializing. So they’re having to reverse some of their loss reserves, actually.\nDebts—corporate debt spreads are, are tight. They’ve tightened. They were very\nbroad—high—wide, of course, at the—during the acute phase of the pandemic, and they’ve—\nyou know, they’re now at the lower end of their typical range. And we do monitor that.\nYou know, it’s, it’s not something we can control or operate on directly, but we do—we\ndo watch those things. And, you know, in a sense, it’s good that companies have been able to\nfinance themselves during this period, because they—they’ve been able to stay in business.\nThey’ve been able to keep their employees working. And, you know, that’s a good thing. And\nthat’s, that’s part of highly accommodative financial conditions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thanks. Chris Rugaber.\nPage 22 of 28\nJanuary 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Thanks. Can you—since you suggested that the concern\nfrom the pandemic is perhaps a shorter-term concern and that’s why you removed some of the\nlanguage from the statement, can you talk about what kind of impact you’re seeing so far?\nDo you feel that structural impacts have been—how would you characterize those? I\nknow that’s been a major concern—you’ve talked about at this press conference and others. Do\nwe see longer-term damage to the job market? Have—or has there been some success in\npreventing that? And, compared to previous recessions, how would you characterize the damage\nto the job market here, in terms of things like, you know, permanent job loss, workers that need\nto shift industries, that kind of thing?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, the, the, the big thing is that the jury’s out. And this has\nbeen a concern since the very beginning, is the concern that people—if, if they become\ndisconnected from the industry or the job where—that they used to work in, it, it can be years or\nnever when they get back into the labor force, particularly for people who are well along in their\ncareers—the same kind of scarring for small businesses, which don’t have the kind of resources\nthat you need to get through this. So we’ve, we’ve had a big concern about, about both of those.\nWe haven’t seen as much of it as we—as we feared. And that’s a good thing. But as I\nsaid that, you know, the jury is out here—9 or 10 million people still out of work because of the\npandemic. They’re—a big chunk of them are people who worked in public-facing jobs in the\nservice sector. And, you know, they’ve gotten a lot of support from fiscal policy and some from\nmonetary policy.\nBut the question is getting them back to work. And, you know, it’s, it’s harder if\nyou’re—it takes longer, empirically, to find that next job if you’re looking at a brand-new\nindustry. It’s not easy to change careers completely midcareer. So that just, again, stresses the\nPage 23 of 28\nJanuary 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nurgency that we feel and others feel at, at, you know, fully defeating the pandemic, finishing the\njob and getting back to a place where it’s safe to have these—you know, to, to, to stay in hotels,\nto fly on airplanes, to go to sporting events and movie theaters, and all of those things.\nSo those people are still at risk. And we’re, we’re very, very focused on that group of\npeople with our policy and, and, and, you know, the way we look at the economy. So many\npeople have had that bridge across the pandemic. You know, we talked about that at the\nbeginning. For many people, it’s clear that they’ve made it across, and their job is okay, and\ntheir house is okay. And, you know, it’s been terribly inconvenient and painful, and schools are\nclosed and things like that. But there, there’s a bunch of people yet who haven’t found that\nbridge yet. And we’re, we’re very focused on that.\nOf course, the other thing is, we’re going to a different economy. And we’re going to be\nlearning more about that as we go. But, clearly, we’re, we’re learning that things can be done\nfrom remote locations. We’re learning that technology can replace people even more than we\nthought. And some of that is happening.\nSo I think as we, you know, as we get into this, you know, the phase after—even after the\neconomy fully reopens, I think we’re still going to need to keep people in mind whose lives have\nbeen disrupted, because they’ve lost that—the work that they did. And I think it would be wise\nas a country, for the longer-run productive capacity of the country, if we were to look out for\nthose people and help them find their way back into the labor force even if it means continuing\nsupport for an additional period of time.\nCHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Great. If I could ask this quick follow—yesterday Susan\nRice, domestic policy advisor at the White House, talked about a Citigroup study that said\nclosing racial economic gaps could add up to $5 trillion to the U.S. economy over the next five\nPage 24 of 28\nJanuary 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nyears and 6 million new jobs. Do you agree that racial disparities are currently a drag on the\neconomy? And, if so, what can the Fed do proactively to narrow those racial gaps in income and\nwealth, including potentially through regulatory policy?\nCHAIR POWELL. I strongly agree with that, as a matter of fact. I think if you look at\neither—look at employment gaps or unemployment gaps or wage gaps, wealth gaps,\nhomeowning gaps, all of those persistent gaps that exist even controlling for many other factors,\nyou will see that they’re, they’re persistent, they’re—and they’re very difficult to explain.\nAnd so it’s—the reason we talk about inequality and, and racial inequality in particular, is\nthat it goes to our job, which is to achieve maximum employment, which, which links up with,\nwith—we want—we want the potential output of the United States to be as high as it can\npossibly be. We want—we want an economy where everybody can take part and everybody,\neverybody can put their labor in, and they can share in the prosperity of our great economy.\nThat’s what we want. And that’s how the U.S. economy can be bigger, stronger, growing faster,\nis if we can achieve a more—a broader prosperity.\nSo, now, in terms of our tools, you know, of course, that project that I just mentioned is\none for the broader society, for the private sector, for fiscal policy, but we have a role to play.\nAnd, and that is, how we think about the labor market. Principally, when we say that the\nmaximum employment is a, a broad and inclusive goal, what we’re—what we’re saying there is,\nwe’re not just going to look at the headline—and we never did, really, but—we’re not going to\njust look at the headline numbers. We’re going to look at different demographic groups,\nincluding women, minorities, and others. And we’re not going to say that we’ve reached\nmaximum employment, which is our statutory goal, until we’ve reached maximum employment.\nPage 25 of 28\nJanuary 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nAnd you haven’t if, if there’s lots of pockets of, of people not participating in or not employed in\nthe labor market. So those are the things that we can do.\nWe also do a tremendous amount of research on these issues. You know, we do—we, we\nhave such a focus on these issues now that we actually—we, we have a new, a webpage,\nrelatively new, where you can access all of it. But it’s a lot of activities in our Division of\nConsumer and Community Affairs. It’s lots of research, and, and it’s also, you know, our\nenforcement of the fair lending laws and things like that. So I think everybody’s got a role to\nplay here. It’s a—it’s a national goal and a national job, and we’re just going to do our part of\nthe job. And it’s something we’re strongly committed to.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. For the last question, we’ll go to Scott Horsley\nat NPR.\nSCOTT HORSLEY. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. You said in your opening remarks that the,\nthe economy in many ways had proven more resilient than, than people expected, and that that\nreflected the adaptability of both households and businesses. Are, are there adaptations that\ncaught you by surprise, maybe related to remote work or new ways to do on-site work, in-person,\nface-to-face work that, that the economy’s proven tougher than, than you expected at the outset\nof this pandemic?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, yes. So I think, if you go back to the—to the beginning, there\nwas a real concern. I mean, just, just take the financial markets, for example. Suddenly, all of\nthose big buildings all over the, the—New York City and all around the world where people\nwork in the financial markets with terminals and everything, everybody had to go home, and\nthey had to take their terminals with them. And I think there was a real concern that there would\nbe a tremendous loss of functionality just at the time when the financial markets were under\nPage 26 of 28\nJanuary 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nhistorically difficult conditions. And yet, it worked out okay. So I think people—many people\nin the financial sector are still working with their terminals at home, including people on trading\nfloors or on virtual trading floors.\nNow, some of that’s reversing now. But we have definitely learned that we can do more\nwork from home in many, many different lines of work. Of course, that’s not possible if your\njob involves being at a place, doing personal services. For many people, it’s not possible. And\nthat’s very much something that skews to higher-income, higher-educated people being able to\nwork from home and others not so much. So I think we’ve learned that.\nThe other thing, though, even conditional on that, when we saw the wave in the South\nand the West, the wave of cases this summer, I think, intuitively, having seen what happened in\nMarch and April, we expected there to be a significant hit to economic activity. And people kind\nof just got on with their lives and went and, and dealt with it. And, and it didn’t actually—it had\na much smaller effect on economic activity than we expected.\nThen comes the fall wave, which is just so much larger—a very, very large wave as, as\nwas very much forecast. People going indoors, the cold weather, all of that. And even there, if\nyou look at—I would say, look at the December jobs report. So, big job losses in, you know, in\nthat part of the service sector. So I mentioned 400,000 jobs in bars and restaurants. There’s\nanother 100,000 in similar kinds of activities. But if you go—if you look elsewhere, it’s not\nhaving an effect. You know, even purchasing manager index and sentiment indexes on, on areas\nof the economy that are not directly—really directly—exposed to the pandemic in their\neconomic activity, they’re doing okay. They are.\nHousing is a great example. You know, the way—the way—the way the housing\nindustry worked, that when you buy a house, there was a lot of in-person contact. They managed\nPage 27 of 28\nJanuary 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nto pretty much immediately go to a more virtual—you know, with all the technology. They were\nable to completely avoid that. And the housing market has been really strong, notwithstanding\nthat it’s, it’s now quite virtual rather than in person.\nSo there’s been a lot of adapting, and—but you can’t adapt, you know, hotels, sporting\nvenues, movie theaters, restaurants, bars. You just—you know, those are just going to—and\nthat’s—again, that’s millions and millions of people. And so you’re just going to have to defeat\nthe pandemic, which, as I mentioned, you know, we, we have a plan to do that, but we haven’t\ndone it yet.\nAnd we need to—we need to finish the job. And we—it’s, it’s within our power to do\nthat as a country this year. And I would just urge that—and I know people are working hard on\nthat. But that, that is really the main thing about the economy, is, is getting the pandemic under\ncontrol, getting everyone vaccinated, getting people wearing masks, and all that. That’s the\nsingle most important economic growth policy that we can have. Thank you.\nPage 28 of 28"

    "statement": "For release at 2 p.m. EDT March 17, 2021\nThe Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the\nU.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment\nand price stability goals.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is causing tremendous human and economic hardship\nacross the United States and around the world. Following a moderation in the pace of\nthe recovery, indicators of economic activity and employment have turned up\nrecently, although the sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic remain weak.\nInflation continues to run below 2 percent. Overall financial conditions remain\naccommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the\nflow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.\nThe path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus,\nincluding progress on vaccinations. The ongoing public health crisis continues to\nweigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation, and poses considerable risks\nto the economic outlook.\nThe Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate\nof 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation running persistently below this\nlonger-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above\n2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer‑term\ninflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. The Committee expects to\nmaintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are\nachieved.

    "press_conf": "March 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nTranscript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference\nMarch 17, 2021\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. I would like to start by noting that it has been a full\nyear since the pandemic arrived with force on our shores. Looking back, it was clear that\naddressing a fast-moving global pandemic would be plainly and primarily the realm of health-\ncare providers and experts, and we are grateful to them and to all the essential workers for their\nservice and sacrifice. The danger to the U.S. economy was also clear. Congress provided by far\nthe fastest and largest response to any postwar economic downturn, offering fiscal support for\nhouseholds, businesses, health-care providers, and state and local governments.\nHere at the Federal Reserve, we rapidly deployed our full range of tools to provide relief\nand stability, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting damage\nto the economy. We are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that\nCongress has given us: maximum employment and price stability.\nThe economic fallout has been real and widespread, but with the benefit of perspective,\nwe can say that some of the very worst economic outcomes have been avoided by swift and\nforceful action—from Congress, from across government, and in cities and towns across the\ncountry. More people held on to their jobs, more businesses kept their doors open, and more\nincomes were saved as a result of these swift and forceful policy actions. And while we\nwelcome these positive developments, no one should be complacent. At the Fed, we will\ncontinue to provide the economy the support that it needs for as long as it takes.\nToday the FOMC kept interest rates near zero and maintained our sizable asset purchases.\nThese measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and on our balance sheet, will\nensure that monetary policy will continue to deliver powerful support to the economy until the\nrecovery is complete.\nPage 1 of 30\nMarch 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nThe path of the economy continues to depend significantly on the course of the virus and\nthe measures undertaken to control its spread. Since January, the number of new cases,\nhospitalizations, and deaths has fallen, and ongoing vaccinations offer hope for a return to more\nnormal conditions later this year. In the meantime, continued observance of social-distancing\nmeasures and wearing masks will help us reach that goal as soon as possible. The economic\nrecovery remains uneven and far from complete, and the path ahead remains uncertain.\nFollowing the moderation in the pace of the recovery that began toward the end of last\nyear, indicators of economic activity and employment have turned up recently, although the\nsectors of the economy most adversely affected by the resurgence of the virus and by greater\nsocial distancing remain weak. Household spending on goods has risen notably so far this year.\nIn contrast, household spending on services remains low, especially in services that typically\nrequire people to gather closely, including travel and hospitality. The housing sector has more\nthan fully recovered from the downturn, while business investment and manufacturing\nproduction have also picked up.\nThe overall recovery in economic activity since last spring is due importantly to\nunprecedented fiscal and monetary policy actions, which have provided essential support to\nhouseholds, businesses, and communities. The recovery has progressed more quickly than\ngenerally expected, and forecasts from FOMC participants for economic growth this year have\nbeen revised up notably since our December Summary of Economic Projections. In commenting\non the stronger outlook, participants noted progress on vaccinations as well as recent fiscal\npolicy.\nAs with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have turned up recently.\nEmployment rose by 379,000 in February, as the leisure and hospitality sector recouped about\nPage 2 of 30\nMarch 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ntwo-thirds of the jobs that were lost in December and January. Nonetheless, employment in this\nsector is more than 3 million below its level at the onset of the pandemic. For the economy as a\nwhole, employment is 9.5 million below its pre-pandemic level. The unemployment rate\nremains elevated at 6.2 percent in February; this figure understates the shortfall in employment,\nparticularly as participation in the labor market remains notably below pre-pandemic levels.\nLooking ahead, FOMC participants project the unemployment rate to continue to decline;\nthe median projection is 4.5 percent at the end of this year and moves down to 3.5 percent by the\nend of 2023. The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least\nable to shoulder the burden have been the hardest hit. In particular, the high level of joblessness\nhas been especially severe for lower-wage workers in the service sector and for African\nAmericans and Hispanics. The economic dislocation has upended many lives and created great\nuncertainty about the future.\nOverall inflation remains below our 2 percent longer-run objective. Over the next few\nmonths, 12-month measures of inflation will move up as the very low readings from March and\nApril of last year fall out of the calculation. Beyond these base effects, we could also see upward\npressure on prices if spending rebounds quickly as the economy continues to reopen, particularly\nif supply bottlenecks limit how quickly production can respond in the near term. However, these\none-time increases in prices are likely to have only transient effects on inflation. The median\ninflation projection of FOMC participants is 2.4 percent this year and declines to 2 percent next\nyear before moving back up by the end of 2023.\nThe Fed’s response to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to\npromote the financial—the stability of the financial system. As we say in our Statement on\nPage 3 of 30\nMarch 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nLonger-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, we view maximum employment as a “broad-\nbased and inclusive goal.” Our ability to achieve maximum employment in the years ahead\ndepends importantly on having longer-term inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent.\nAs the Committee reiterated in today’s policy statement, with inflation running\npersistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for\nsome time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations\nremain well anchored at 2 percent. We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary\npolicy until these employment and inflation outcomes are achieved. With regard to interest rates,\nwe continue to expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range\nfor the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the\nCommittee’s assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on\ntrack to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. I would note that a transitory rise in\ninflation above 2 percent, as seems likely to occur this year, would not meet this standard.\nIn addition, we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least\n$80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per\nmonth until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum-employment and\nprice-stability goals. The increase in our balance sheet since last March has materially eased\nfinancial conditions and is providing substantial support to the economy. The economy is a long\nway from our employment and inflation goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial\nfurther progress to be achieved.\nOur forward guidance for the federal funds rate, along with our balance sheet guidance,\nwill ensure that the stance of monetary policy remains highly accommodative as the recovery\nprogresses. Our guidance is outcome based and ties the path of the federal funds rate and the\nPage 4 of 30\nMarch 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nbalance sheet to progress toward reaching our employment and inflation goals. Overall, our\ninterest rate and balance sheet tools are providing powerful support to the economy and will\ncontinue to do so.\nTo conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses\nacross the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We are committed to\nusing our full range of tools to support the economy and to help assure that the recovery from\nthis difficult period will be as robust as possible. Thank you. I look forward to your questions.\nJOE PAVEL. Howard from Reuters.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Hi, Chair Powell, and, and thanks for that. So could you talk\nus through how the, the forecasts for 2021 map into the “substantial further progress”\ndefinition—you know, 2.4 percent inflation—I understand that’s considered transitory. That still\nseems like some progress there, 4½ percent unemployment. Is it time to start talking about\ntalking about tapering yet?\nCHAIR POWELL. [Laughter] Not yet. So, as you—as you pointed out, we’ve said that\nwe would continue asset purchases at this pace until we see substantial further progress. And\nthat’s actual progress, not forecast progress. So—and that’s a difference from, from our past\napproach. So—and what we mean by that is, is pretty straightforward. It is, we want to see that,\nthat the labor markets have moved—labor market conditions have moved—you know, have\nmade substantial progress toward maximum employment, and inflation has made substantial\nprogress toward the 2 percent goal. That’s what we’re going to want to see. Now, that\nobviously includes an element of judgment. And when we see—we’ll be—we’ll be carefully\nlooking ahead.\nPage 5 of 30\nMarch 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nWe, we also understand that we, we will want to provide as much advance notice of any\npotential taper as possible. So when we see that we’re on track, when we see actual data coming\nin that suggests that we’re on track to perhaps achieve substantial further progress, then we’ll say\nso. And we’ll say so well in advance of any decision to actually taper.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. If, if I could follow up on that, this shift in the dots—why\nwouldn’t that suggest a weakening of the commitment here? An awful lot of people shifted into\n2022, it seems.\nCHAIR POWELL. I, I don’t see that at all. You know, we, we have a, a range of\nperspectives on the Committee. I welcome that. And, you know, we, we have—we debate\nthings, we discuss things, and we always come together around a—around a, a solution. But,\nyou know, the, the strong bulk of the Committee is, is not showing a rate increase during this\nforecast period. And, you know, as, as data improve, as the outlook improves very significantly\nsince the December meeting, you would expect forecasts to move up. It’s probably not a\nsurprise that some people would bring in their estimate of the appropriate time for liftoff.\nNonetheless, you know, the bulk of the Committee—the, the largest part by far of the\nCommittee is, is—doesn’t show a rate increase during this period. And, again, part of that is\nwanting to see actual data rather than just a forecast at this point. We do expect that we’ll begin\nto make faster progress on both spending—you know, labor markets and inflation as the year\ngoes on because of the progress with the vaccines, because of the fiscal support that we’re\ngetting. We expect that to happen. But, you know, we’ll have to see it first.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Great, thank you. Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Chair Powell. I wanted to ask about the supplementary\nleverage ratio. You know, there’s been a lot of talk about what you all are going to do this\nPage 6 of 30\nMarch 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nmonth, which—I’m happy to hear an update if you have one. But just sort of more broadly, do\nyou think, long term, that the leverage ratio poses problems for implementing monetary policy at\na time when the reserve supply is going to remain large? And, if so, do you think the changes to\nthe leverage ratio, including the SLR, are the way to deal with that problem?\nCHAIR POWELL. Victoria, we’ll have something to announce on that in coming days.\nAnd I’m not going to expound upon your questions. Why don’t you—why don’t you ask\nanother question if you’d like to? Because, because that one—I’m just going to say that we’ll\nhave something in coming days.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Sure. Okay. Well, then I’ll ask about unemployment. You know,\nthere’s—the unemployment rate is—you all have projections for the U-6 rate, but you’ve also\nbeen, you know, really emphasizing the fact that that’s not the only thing that you all are looking\nat. You’re also looking at labor force participation and things like that. So are you all looking at\nways of maybe adding to how you’re projecting the unemployment rate to the Summary of\nEconomic Projections?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, let me say, as we say in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals\nand Monetary Policy Strategy, we look to a range of indicators on the labor market. We never\nonly looked at the unemployment rate, which is the only indicator of, of labor market outcomes\nthat’s in the SEP. We look at a very broad range. You hear us talk all the time about\nparticipation; about employment to population, which is the combination of the two; about\ndifferent measures of, of unemployment. So it’s wages, it’s, it’s the job flows, it’s, you know, all\nof those things. They go into an assessment—disparities of various groups. All that goes into an\nassessment of maximum employment.\nPage 7 of 30\nMarch 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nThe, the—trying to incorporate all of that into the Summary of Economic Projections\nwould not be practical. You know, obviously, the thing that we do include is just the\nunemployment rate, and that’s a very insufficient statistic. So—it, it doesn’t include a lot of\nother things that we—that we do look at. And I, I wouldn’t want to say that we’re looking to\ninclude the other dozen things that we look at into the SEP. But at time—from time to time, we\ndo look at, at adding different things. But I, I would just say the SEP is, it’s a summary. It’s one\ndevice. It’s not going to include all of the things that we look at. I think you know the things\nthat we look at—we, we talk about them all the time. So we’re not actually looking actively at\nsignificantly broadening those indicators in the SEP right now.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Chris Rugaber, Associated Press.\nCHRIS RUGABER. Thank you. Chair Powell, I wanted to ask about the forecast\noverall. You’re forecasting a very low unemployment rate next year and in 2023, you have\ninflation—or, the Fed overall is, in the SEP, forecasting inflation at or above 2 percent by 2023,\nyet no rate hike in any of this—in any of this forecast horizon. So is this telling us that we could\nsee a higher inflation rate than was projected? Or do you not—as you’ve been talking about, is\nthe unemployment rate insufficient? Or what is this telling us about the Fed’s reaction function,\nthat it seems you’re meeting the Fed’s dual mandate by 2023, yet, again, no rate hike expected?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I guess the first thing to say is that the, the SEP is not a\nCommittee forecast. It’s, it’s not something we sit around and debate and discuss and approve,\nand say, “This represents our, you know, our reaction function as a Committee.” It’s a\ncompilation of projections from different people. And I—since we don’t debate it or discuss it, it\nwould be hard for me to say why—exactly why each participant did what they were going to do.\nPage 8 of 30\nMarch 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nSo all I would say about this is that we’ve—we laid out what I think is very clear\nguidance on liftoff. And it’s really three things: labor market conditions that are consistent with\nour estimates of maximum employment—and, as I mentioned, we consider a wide range of\nindicators in assessing labor market conditions, not just the unemployment rate; inflation that has\nreached 2 percent, and not just on a transitory basis; and inflation that’s on track to run\nmoderately above 2 percent for some time. The first two of those three are very much data\nbased; the third does have a little bit of a—of an element of expectations in it. So we are very\nmuch determined to implement this guidance in a robust way. It is the guidance that we chose\ncarefully to implement our new framework. And to meet these standards, we’ll need to see data,\nas I mentioned.\nSo what does—what does this, this SEP really say? It says that we’re committed to our\nframework and to the guidance we’ve provided to implement that framework. We will wait until\nthe requirements set forth in that guidance are clearly met before considering a change in our\npolicy rate. And the last thing I’ll say is this: The state of the economy in two or three years is\nhighly uncertain, and I wouldn’t want to focus too much on the exact timing of a potential rate\nincrease that far into the future. So that’s how I would think about the, the SEP.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Paul Kiernan.\nPAUL KIERNAN. Thank you, Chairman Powell. My question is twofold. One, how\nhigh are you comfortable letting inflation rise? There, there is some ambiguity in, in your new\ntarget, as you mentioned, “expectations driven.” And, and do you think that that ambiguity\nmight cause markets to price in a lower tolerance for inflation than the Fed actually has, thereby\ncausing financial conditions to tighten prematurely? Is that a concern? Thanks.\nPage 9 of 30\nMarch 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. So we’ve said we’d like to see inflation run moderately above\n2 percent for some time. And we’ve resisted, basically, generally, the temptation to try to\nquantify that. Part of that just is, talking about inflation is one thing; actually having inflation\nrun above 2 percent is the real thing. So I—you know, over the years we’ve, we’ve talked about\n2 percent inflation as a goal, but we haven’t achieved it. So I, I would say we’d like to, you\nknow, perform. That’s what we’d really like to do, is to get inflation moderately above\n2 percent.\nI don’t want to be too specific about what that means, because I think it’s hard to do that.\nAnd we haven’t done it yet. You know, when we’re actually above 2 percent, we can do that.\nI—look, I, I would say this. The fundamental change in, in our framework is that we, we’re not\ngoing to act preemptively based on forecasts for the most part. And we’re going to wait to see\nactual data. And I think it will take people time to, to adjust to that—and to adjust to that new\npractice. And the only way we can really build the credibility of that is by doing it. So that’s\nhow I would think about that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Matthew Boesler.\nMATTHEW BOESLER. Hi, Chair Powell. This is Matthew Boesler with Bloomberg\nNews. So there’s a widespread presumption at this point that the U.S. will reach herd immunity\nsometime this year. And all along, you’ve said that the path of the economy is going to be\ndetermined by the course of the virus. I’m curious, based on the projections that you released\ntoday that show unemployment will still be above estimates of maximum employment through\nthe end of next year and perhaps sometime into 2023, do you think policymakers need to be\ndoing more here to sort of align the herd immunity and full employment timelines, if you will?\nThank you.\nPage 10 of 30\nMarch 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. So, on, on herd immunity, I, I’m really going to leave that question\nto the experts. We don’t control that. We’re not responsible for defining it. And we’ll, we’ll\nleave that whole discussion to the experts. I mean, we’re—what we’re focused on is, is the part\nthat we control, which is the support that we provide to the economy. And there we’ve provided\nvery clear guidance. And in the case of asset purchases, it’s at their current level until we make\nsubstantial further progress. There is an element of judgment in that, and we’ll, we’ll—\ntherefore, we’ll supply clear communication well in advance of, of actually tapering, and we just\nwent through, you know, the, the criteria for raising interest rates. They’re very specific. And,\nyou know, we’re, we’re very much committed to having them fulfilled robustly.\nI, I would agree with you that the, the path of the virus continues to be very important.\nWe, we have these, you know, new strains with—which, which can be quite virulent. And we’re\nnot actually done yet. And I, I—we’re clearly on a good path with, with cases coming down, as I\nmentioned, but we’re not done. And I’d hate to see us take our eye off the ball before we\nactually finish the job. So that’s how I would look at that.\nMATTHEW BOESLER. If I could just briefly follow up, how do you see sort of the\ndisconnect in terms of an economy that is expected to be widely reopened this year but full\nemployment taking longer to achieve? Is it, is it the case that factors related to the virus will still\nbe with us over the coming years? Is that how to interpret the forecasts?\nCHAIR POWELL. I think there’s some of that. Sure, there’ll be some of that. There\nwill still be some social distancing. People may be, for example, going into spaces that, that, you\nknow, that involve close contact with others. Some people will do that right away. Others will\nhold back. And so I think there’ll—there’ll be some of that.\nPage 11 of 30\nMarch 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nIn addition, though, remember, there are—there are 10 million people—in the range of\n10 million people who need to get back to work. And it’s going to take some time for that to\nhappen. You know, it can—it can happen maybe, maybe more quickly than it has in the past,\nbecause it involves the reopening of a sector of the economy, as opposed to stimulating\naggregate demand and waiting for that to produce job demand for workers. This could be a\ndifferent sort of a process. And it could be quicker. We don’t know that. But it’s, it’s just a lot\nof people who have—who need to get back to work. And it’s not going to happen overnight. It\nwould be—it’s going to take some time. No matter how well the economy performs,\nunemployment will take quite a time to go—to go down, and so will participation. So that’s all I\ncan say. I think the faster the better; we’d love to see it come sooner rather than later. We’d\nwelcome nothing more than that. But, realistically, given the numbers, it’s going to take\nsome time.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you, Steve Liesman.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Mr. Chairman, thank you. I wonder if you could—kind of a three-\nparter here, but all related. Would you comment on the current level of the 10-year yield and\nsome other long rates out there, whether or not you think they would have a negative effect on\nthe economy? And, if not, is there a level that would give you concern? And, finally, the third\npart: Other central bankers have expressed concern about what’s happened to yields in their\ncountries and even some taken action, but not you. Could you give us your general idea or\norientation towards the idea of, of coming into the market and affecting a particular tenor of the\nbond market? Do—do you like that idea? Do you not like it? Is it at the top of your toolbox, or\nis it something that you think is at the bottom of the toolbox?\nPage 12 of 30\nMarch 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So we monitor a broad range of financial conditions, and\nwe’re always attentive to market developments, of course. We’re still a long way from our\ngoals, and it’s important that financial conditions do remain accommodative to support the\nachievement of those goals. And if you look at various indexes of financial conditions, what\nyou’ll see is that they generally do show financial conditions overall to be highly\naccommodative. And that is appropriate. So that’s, that’s how we look at it.\nI would add, as I’ve said, I would be concerned by disorderly conditions in markets or by\na persistent tightening of financial conditions that threaten the achievement of our goals. We\nthink the stance of our—of monetary policy remains appropriate. Our guidance on the federal\nfunds rate and on asset purchases is providing strong support for the economy. And we’re\ncommitted to maintaining that patiently accommodative stance until the job is well and\ntruly done.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Could, could you give us an idea of how you sort of feel about that\ntool, of being able to come into a particular part of the market and either operating—doing an\nOperation Twist or something like that? Is that something you feel to be the top of your toolbox\nor something that you don’t really prefer?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, we—the tools we have are the tools we have. What I’m\ntelling you is that the stance of monetary policy we have today, we believe, is appropriate. We\nthink that our asset purchases in their current form—which is to say, you know, across the curve,\n$80 billion in Treasuries, $40 billion in mortgage-backed securities on net—we think that that’s,\nthat’s the right place for our asset purchases. Now, we can—we can change them, of course, in,\nin a number of different dimensions should we deem that that’s appropriate. But, for now, we\nthink that our policy stance on that is appropriate.\nPage 13 of 30\nMarch 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Rachel Siegel.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Hi, Chair Powell. Thanks very much for taking my question.\nYou’ve spoken about the pandemic’s disproportionate toll on Black Americans, Hispanic\nAmericans, Asian Americans, and other groups in the labor market. And I’m curious if you can\nspeak to specific indicators that the Fed will be using to measure job gains for groups that have\npersistently higher rates of unemployment compared to white Americans. And, relatedly, since\nyou’ve described vaccines as key to the economic recovery, is the Fed concerned about lower\nvaccination rates in communities of color? And what barriers do you think exist there? Thanks\nvery much.\nCHAIR POWELL. So, which measures. So we, we do monitor and communicate very\nregularly about different labor market—disparities in the labor market, let’s say. So the African\nAmerican unemployment rate is substantially elevated, and so is the Hispanic unemployment\nrate. So we look at those and we see those as, you know—it’s, it’s slack in the labor market.\nIt’s, it’s sad to see, because those disparities had really come down to record lows since we\nstarted keeping the data that way. As recently as a year ago, February of last year, we had those,\nthose disparities quite low. What happens in a downturn, though, is they move up at twice the\nspeed of white unemployment. So we monitor those things.\nWe—our tools, of course, affect unemployment generally, but we’re going to look at\nthose as, as a form of slack in the labor market and hope that, you know, that there’s progress\nthere. And, and this particular downturn, of course, was just a direct hit on, on a part of the\neconomy that employs many minorities and lower-paid workers. The public-facing workers in\nthe service industries in many cases don’t have a lot of financial assets, they’re not tremendously\nwell paid, they might have other jobs, and things like that. So this was a direct hit on that part of\nPage 14 of 30\nMarch 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthe economy. And it’s the slowest part of the economy to recover. So, you know, we’d like to\nsee those people continue to get supported, you know, as we—as the broader economy recovers,\nwhich, which it’s very much doing now.\nIn terms of disparate levels of vaccination, that’s—those are facts and unfortunate facts.\nThey’re really not something we, we have within our policy toolkit to address. But it is—it is\ntrue, though, that the data we have suggests that there are—there are significant disparities\nbetween different ethnic groups and—you know, but that’s, that’s not for us. That’s for fiscal\nauthorities and the government more generally to, to work on.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Jeanna Smialek.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Hey, Chair Powell. Thanks for taking our questions. I was\nwondering if you could talk a little bit about how you see the fiscal policy support that has come\ndown the line affecting the economy’s potential in the longer term, just in the sense that you’ve\ntalked a lot about the potential for labor market scarring and how that might weigh on our, sort\nof, future prospects. And I wonder whether you see that sort of working in reverse. You know,\nif we put people back into the labor market more quickly, does that improve our chances?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I do think that fiscal policy overall will have really helped us to\navoid much of the scarring that we were very, very concerned about at the beginning. And I\nthink that’s just the size and the speed with which Congress has delivered—you know, with the\nCARES Act and since then, has—is going to wind up very much accelerating the return to full\nemployment. It’s going to make a huge difference in people’s lives. And it has already.\nAs I mentioned in my remarks—opening remarks, the recovery has been faster than we\nexpected. Part of that just is, it’s very hard to predict, given we’ve never seen an event like this.\nBut part of it is just the strength of the fiscal response, which I think will, will look good over the\nPage 15 of 30\nMarch 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nyears. Longer term, you know, to, to really—that’s—the first part of it is about avoiding\nscarring, and I think we’ve not avoided all of the scarring, but we’ve probably avoided the worst\ncases there. And, and I hope we keep at it, and we will keep at it with our policies, of course, to\ndo whatever we can to make sure that’s—that continues.\nLonger term though, what it takes to drive productive capacity per capita or per hour\nworked, to raise living standards over time, is investment: investment in people’s skills and\naptitudes, investment in plant and equipment, investment in software. It takes a lot of investment\nto, to support a more productive economy and raise living standards. And that’s—you know,\nthat hasn’t been the principal focus with these measures—our measures, certainly. And we don’t\nhave those tools. But what Congress has been doing has mainly been replacing lost income and\nbeginning to, you know, support people as the economy returns to normal. But there should be a\nfocus on—a longer-term focus, I think, would be healthy on, on the investment front.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. James Politi.\nJAMES POLITI. Thank you, Chair Powell. I wanted to ask a question about the euro\nzone. While the outlook for the U.S. economy has much improved, progress in the euro zone has\nbeen far less encouraging. And it’s showing signs of serious weakness due, due to the slower\nvaccination rollout and renewed lockdowns and restrictions. How worried are you about\ntransatlantic economic divergence and the possibility that, that trouble in the euro zone and\nweakness in the euro zone could, could drag down the U.S. recovery as it did, in a way, in the\naftermath of the financial crisis?\nCHAIR POWELL. You’re right that the pace of the recovery is that we’re having\ndiverging recoveries here, as we did after the last crisis. And in this case, as well as the other\none, the U.S.’s recovery is, is leading the global recovery. And, you know, we conduct policy,\nPage 16 of 30\nMarch 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nof course, here. Our, our focus is on—our, you know—our, our objectives are domestic ones.\nIt’s, it’s maximum employment and price stability here in the United States. We monitor\ndevelopments abroad, and we know—because they know we know that they can—those can\naffect our outcomes. So I think U.S. demand—very strong U.S. demand, if, if—as the economy\nimproves is going to support global activity as well over time. That, that’ll be through imports.\nAnd, you know, when the U.S. economy is strong, that strength tends to be—tends to support\nglobal, global activity as well. So that’s one thing.\nI don’t—I don’t worry in the near term. I mean, I’d love to see Europe growing faster.\nI’d love to see the vaccine rollout going more smoothly. But I don’t worry too much about us in\nthe near term, because we’re, we’re on a very good track. Very strong fiscal support coming,\nnow vaccination going quickly, and cases coming down. I think we’re—I think we’re in a good\nplace. It’s all ahead of us, but the data should, should get stronger fairly quickly here and remain\nstrong for some time here.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Hannah Lang.\nHANNAH LANG. Hi, thanks so much for taking our questions. I wanted to ask if the\nFed is planning on extending the same restrictions on bank dividends and share repurchases—\nI’m sorry, share repurchases that are currently in place into the second quarter, and if you’re\nconsidering at all the scenario analysis and midcycle stress tests that were in place last year, this\nyear. And, kind of, what would make you consider doing something like that again?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we haven’t made a decision on that. We’re a couple weeks away\nfrom announcing that decision. I, I won’t foreshadow it here today. I will say, we’re going to\ncontinue our data-driven approach. You know that we restricted buybacks and dividends, so the\nfirms are preserving capital. Through 2020, the banks actually increased their level of capital\nPage 17 of 30\nMarch 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nand their level of reserves. And the December stress tests showed that banks are strong and well\ncapitalized under our hypothetical recessions that we—that we used in December, which were\nquite stringent.\nWe’re right in the middle of our 2021 stress tests, and we’ll release those results before\nthe end of June. And that layers, you know, very significant additional stress on top of the stress\nthe banks have already absorbed over the past year, with the unemployment rate going to\n11 percent and stock prices falling more than 50 percent. So—but all of that, you know, the\nresults of the stress tests and the decision on distributions—all of that is to come fairly soon, as I\nmentioned.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Edward Lawrence.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thanks, Chair Powell, for taking these questions. You laid\nout the standards to lift off. And back in June of 2020, you said, you know, you’re not even\nthinking about thinking about raising rates. But I see seven members seeing liftoff in 2023 and 4\nnext year. How, how much debate—and how can you characterize that conversation—has there\nbeen about moving off the lower bound earlier than signaled?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, you know, it all depends. We’ve set out very clear criteria for\nliftoff, right, where we’ve said we want to see labor market conditions that are consistent with\nour estimates of, of maximum employment. And that doesn’t just mean unemployment, it means\na much broader set of criteria. We want inflation at 2 percent, and not on a transitory basis. And\nwe want inflation on track to be moderately—to run moderately above 2 percent for some time.\nThose are the three conditions. Everybody on the Committee agrees to that, right?\nSo it comes down to, what’s your projection for the economy? If you want to—if you\nwant to—you know, people will have a range of, of assessments for how good the economy is\nPage 18 of 30\nMarch 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ngoing to be. And, you know, we, we don’t—I would say that we’re in a relatively highly\nuncertain situation. If you look at the uncertainty, people, people on the Committee broadly say\nthat uncertainty about the forecast is, is very high compared to the normal level. We haven’t\ncome out of a pandemic before. We haven’t had this kind of fiscal support before, totaling it all\nup. So you’re going to have different perspectives from Committee participants about how fast\ngrowth will be, how fast the labor market will heal, or how fast—sorry, inflation will move up.\nAnd those things are going to dictate where people write down an estimate of liftoff.\nOf course, this isn’t a decision to lift off now. We’ll make that decision then. But it’s an\nestimate based on—based on assumptions about growth. And it’s, it’s meant to be a tool to\ngenerally show the public how, how our objective function works, how we think about the\nfuture. It isn’t meant to actually pin down a time when we might or might not lift off. We—you\nknow, we’re not going to make that decision for some time. The chances are that the economy in\nthat time and place will be very different from the one we think it’ll be.\nSo I—sometimes with the dots, I have to be sure to point out that they—they’re not a\nCommittee forecast. And you know this, but it’s—they’re not a Committee forecast. It’s just\ncompiling these projections, really, of individual people. We think it serves a useful purpose.\nIt’s not meant to, to actually be a promise or even a prediction of when the Committee will act.\nThat will be very much dependent on economic outcomes, which are highly uncertain.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We’ll go to Brian Cheung.\nBRIAN CHEUNG. Hey there, Chairman Powell. I wanted to elaborate a little bit on\nyour commentary about the fiscal stimulus. So it sounds like you, I guess, see the case for even\nmaybe more investment, at least from Congress, to support the more productive economy, as you\nanswered to Jeanna’s question. So we just had $1.9 trillion dollars in spending. So where do\nPage 19 of 30\nMarch 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nyou see the fiscal space right now? Do you still, I guess, maybe see the country in a place right\nnow where it wouldn’t be a concern if there were to be more spending at this time?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, Brian, it’s not up to us to decide what, what Congress should\nspend money on or when. I was answering Jeanna’s question, which really was, how do we\nassure lack of damage to—scarring, for example, or lack of damage to the productive capacity of\nthe economy? And I think what’s happened so far has done a pretty good job of that. But,\nreally, I wanted to make the longer-run point that if—to work on the productivity—on\nproductivity over longer periods, that is—that is—comes down to a number of things. But one\nof those things is investment: investment in people, in their skills, education, aptitude, all of\nthose things.\nI’m not in any way suggesting that that’s something Congress should work on right now.\nOr that, you know, that’s just not my—that’s not our job. I’m just saying, that, that is what fiscal\npolicy can do that, really, monetary policy can’t do—is, is invest in the future productive\ncapacity of the economy, raise potential growth. Those things are completely tools that Congress\nhas. And, again, I wasn’t making a comment at all on the current fiscal setting.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Next to Michael Derby.\nMICHAEL DERBY. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to get your—an\nupdated view on your sense of your view on financial stability risks and whether or not you see\nany pockets of excess out in financial markets that concern you, either, you know, specifically to\nthat, that area of the market or as in terms of, like, the threat that it could pose to—propose to the\noverall economy.\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So, as you know, financial stability for us is, is a framework.\nIt’s not one thing. It’s not a particular market or a particular asset or anything like that. It’s a\nPage 20 of 30\nMarch 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nframework that we, we have. We report on it semiannually, the Board gets a report on it\nquarterly, and we monitor every day. And it has—it has four pillars, and those are four key\nvulnerabilities: asset valuations, debt owed by businesses and households, funding risk, and\nleverage among financial institutions. Those four things. And I’ll just quickly touch on them.\nSo if you look at asset valuations, you can say that by some measures, some asset\nvaluations are elevated compared to history. I think that’s clear. In terms of households and\nbusinesses, households entered the, the crisis in very good shape by historical standards.\nLeverage in the household sector had been just kind of gradually moving down and down and\ndown since the—since the financial crisis. Now, there was—there was some negative effects on\nthat, people lost their jobs and that sort of thing, but they’ve also gotten a lot of support now. So\nthe damage hasn’t been as, as bad as we thought. Businesses, by the same token, had a high debt\nload coming in. And—but—and many saw their revenues decline. But there’s—they’ve done so\nmuch financing, and there’s a lot of cash on their balance sheet. So nothing in those two sectors\nreally jumps out as really troubling.\nShort term—I mentioned funding risk as the—as the last one. So we saw, again, in this\ncrisis, breakdowns in parts of the short-term funding markets—came under a tremendous amount\nof stress. And they’ve been quiet since the spring. And, you know, we shut down our facilities\nand all of that. But we, we don’t—we don’t feel like we can let the moment pass without just\nsaying again that we—that those—some aspects of the short-term funding markets and, more\nbroadly, nonbank financial intermediation didn’t hold up so well under great stress—under\ntremendous stress. And we need to go back and look at that. So a very high priority for us as\nregulators and supervisors is going to be to go back—and this, this will involve all the other\nregulatory agencies; it does involve all of them as well—and see if we can strengthen those\nPage 21 of 30\nMarch 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthings. So that’s, that’s a—sort of a broader, detailed look.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Michael McKee.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Mr. Chairman, can you help me understand something about the,\nthe SEP and your forecasts? The inflation that you’re talking about for this year, you say, is\n“transitory.” Then, by 2023, you’re back down to 2.1 percent. There’s no forecast for a rate\nincrease for 2023. If you get to 3½ percent unemployment but inflation is only at 2 or\n2.1 percent, are you willing to leave rates at zero going forward from there—or, roughly zero\ngoing forward from there? In other words, could we be in a Japan-like situation where rates just\nstay low because inflation does?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, again, I wouldn’t read too much into, into the, the March 2021\nSEP dot plot. Remember what it is: It’s a compilation of individual projections by individual\nmembers. They’re all making different assessments. They, they have different forecasts,\neconomic forecasts. Some have more optimistic ones, some less optimistic. And they’re—also\nremember that the SEP doesn’t actually include all the things that go into maximum\nemployment. Right? It’s, it’s only—it only includes unemployment.\nSo I, I would just say, we’ve set out clear guidance. The—the message from the SEP that\nI would like to leave with people is, we set out clear guidance. I mentioned what it was. It’s\ninflation up to—no, sorry, it’s, it’s labor market conditions consistent with our estimates of\nmaximum employment—and that’s not just unemployment, it’s all the other indicators, but,\noverall, totaling up to maximum employment; it’s inflation at 2 percent, and not on a transient\nbasis; and inflation on track to exceed 2 percent for—moderately for some time. Those are the\ncriteria. We’re committed to robustly implementing that guidance.\nPage 22 of 30\nMarch 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nAnd that’s what this—that’s what this says. That’s really all it says. We’re going to wait\nuntil those requirements are met. And, again, you know, the, the state of the economy in two or\nthree years is highly uncertain. And I wouldn’t want to focus too much on the exact timing of a\npotential rate increase that far into the future.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. If I could follow up, I’m just wondering—before 2019, I would\nsay you were focused on the problems with having interest rates too low. Now are you saying\nwe’re willing to live with it until we reach these goals even if you get—meet your goal on\nmaximum employment?\nCHAIR POWELL. So what I would say is, we’re committed to giving the economy the\nsupport that it needs to return as quickly as possible to a state of maximum employment and\nprice stability. And, you know, to the extent having rates low and support for monetary policy\nbroadly, to the extent that raises other questions, we think it’s absolutely essential to maintain the\nstrength and stability of the—of the broader financial system and to carefully monitor financial\nstability questions if that’s what you’re getting at. You know, we, we do that. We will—we\nmonitor them very carefully.\nI, I would point out that, over the long expansion—the longest in U.S. history, 10 years\nand 8 months—rates were very low for—they were at zero for, you know, 7 years and then—and\nthen never got above, you know, 2.4 percent, roughly. During that, we didn’t see, actually,\nexcess buildup of debt. We didn’t see asset prices form into bubbles that would threaten the\nprogress of the economy. We didn’t see the things you—we didn’t see a housing bubble. You\nknow, the things that have tended to really hurt an economy and have in recent history hurt the\nU.S., we didn’t see them build up despite very low rates. Part of that just is that you’re in a low-\nrate environment, you’re in a much lower rate environment, and the connection between low\nPage 23 of 30\nMarch 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nrates and the kind of financial instability issues is just not as tight as people think it is.\nThat’s not to say we ignore it. We don’t ignore it. We, we watch it very carefully. And\nwe don’t think—we think there is a connection. We say there is, but it’s not quite so clear. We\nactually monitor financial conditions very, very broadly and carefully. And we didn’t do that\nbefore the Global Financial Crisis 12 years ago. Now we do. And we’ve also, you know, put a\nlot of time and effort into strengthening the large financial institutions that form the core of our\nfinancial system—are much stronger, much more resilient. That’s true of the banks. I think it’s\ntrue of the CCPs. We want it to be true of, of other nonbank financial intermediation, markets,\nand, and institutions.\nSo I think that’s, that’s—you know, monetary policy should be, to me, for, for achieving\nour macroeconomic aims. Financial regulatory policy and supervision should be for\nstrengthening the financial system so that it is strong and robust and can withstand the kinds of\nthings that it couldn’t, frankly—and we learned that in 2008, ’09, ’10. This time around, the\nregulated part of the financial system held up very well. We, we found some other areas that\nneed strengthening, and that’s what we’re working on now.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Anneken, CNN.\nANNEKEN TAPPE. Thanks for taking my question. Chairman Powell, could you talk\nto us a little bit about the relationship between the persistent pandemic unemployment and the\nexpected increase in, in inflation? Does the former offset the latter to some degree?\nCHAIR POWELL. I’m sorry, could you repeat that? You broke up there for a second.\nANNEKEN TAPPE. Oh, no, I was hoping that wouldn’t happen. Can you hear me now?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes, yes.\nPage 24 of 30\nMarch 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nANNEKEN TAPPE. Okay, great. I was asking if you could talk to us a little bit about\nthe relationship between the persistent pandemic unemployment and the expected increase in\ninflation. I’m wondering whether the former offsets the latter and to which degree you guys are\nmonitoring this.\nCHAIR POWELL. You’re asking about the relationship between unemployment and\ninflation? Is that—is that the question?\nANNEKEN TAPPE. Yes, exactly.\nCHAIR POWELL. Okay.\nANNEKEN TAPPE. If they offset each other—the persistent pandemic unemployment.\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes, I think I’m hearing you correctly. So I would say a couple\nthings. There was a time when there was a tight connection between unemployment and\ninflation. That time is long gone. We had extremely low unemployment in, in—not extremely\nlow. We had low unemployment in 2018 and ’19 and the beginning of ’20 without having\ntroubling inflation at all. We were at 3.5 percent. We were bouncing around with\nunemployment 3.5 percent to 4 percent. And it wasn’t just unemployment. Participation was\nhigh, wages were moving up. It was a very healthy thing. And we didn’t see price inflation\nmove up.\nThere is a relationship between wage inflation and unemployment. But that has not—\nwhat, what happens is that when wages move up because unemployment is low, companies have\nbeen absorbing that increase into their margins rather than raising prices. And that seems to be a\nfeature of late-cycle behavior. So we’re, we’re not—when, when we—when we seek to achieve\nlow unemployment, high levels of employment, which is our mandate, you know, we think we\nhave the freedom to do that based on the data without worrying too much about inflation.\nPage 25 of 30\nMarch 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Going to Greg Robb.\nGREG ROBB. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow up a little bit. I, I\nunderstand what you’re saying about the dot plot and, and the message you’re trying to send with\nthe dot plot. But does the same apply for the taper tantrum? You’ve said that it’s going to take\n“some time” to get some fundamental progress on your goals, but it seems like “some time”\ncould now be any time.\nCHAIR POWELL. So we’ve said “substantial further progress.” Now, if you go back,\nOctober, November—sorry, November, December, and January, progress in the labor market\nslowed very sharply. So you had an average of 29,000 jobs per month. If you go back and look\nat the, the level of job creation before that, it was very, very high—very high. So we weren’t\nmaking any progress on the labor market from November through January. February, we saw a\nnice—a nice pickup, a good jobs report—379,465 private sector. So that’s good. It can go so\nmuch higher, though.\nAnd, and, you know, it would be nice to see—to really make faster progress that’s\ndifferent from substantial progress, we’d like to see it be, be higher than that. And I think it will\nbe. That’s—the expectation is, you’ll see now, I think, really strong job creation return—not as\nhigh as it was in the very early days of the recovery, the reopening of the economy, but,\nnonetheless, very strong.\nOkay. So what, what I’m saying is, to achieve substantial progress from where we are,\nhaving had three months of, of very little progress, is going to take some time. And it’s—we\ndon’t want to get into—I don’t want to get into trying to put a pin on the calendar someplace,\nbecause it’s going to be data dependent. When we see—when we see ourselves on track to make\nsubstantial further progress, we’re going to—we’re going to say so. We understand fully that\nPage 26 of 30\nMarch 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthat test is one that involves judgment.\nIf you remember, during the Global Financial Crisis recovery, we said quantitative\neasing, number three, was—the test was a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor\nmarket. Well, what does that mean? Well, it means a substantial improvement in the outlook for\nthe labor market. It meant we would communicate when we thought we had that. This is just\nlike that, in a way. What we’re saying is, substantial further progress toward our goals. We’ll\ntell people when we think—until we—until we say—until we give a signal, you can assume\nwe’re not there yet. And as we approach it, well in advance—well in advance—we will give a\nsignal that, yes, we’re on a path to, to possibly achieve that, to consider tapering.\nSo that’s, that’s how we’re planning to handle it. It’s not different, really, from, from\nQE3. And I think we’ve learned—what we’ve learned from the experience of these last dozen\nyears is to communicate very carefully, very clearly, well in advance, and then follow through\nwith, with your communications. In this case, it’s, it’s an outcome-based set of guidance, as our\nrate guidance is, and it’s going to depend on the progress of the economy. That’s why it’s not\nappropriate to start pointing at dates yet.\nGREG ROBB. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Don Lee, L.A. Times.\nDON LEE. Hi, Chair Powell. As you know, households, households are sitting on a lot\nof excess savings. And I wonder if, combined with that, you have an unleashing of, you know,\npent-up demand. How much do you think that would affect—that would affect inflation? And\nwould you expect that to be transitory?\nCHAIR POWELL. We, you know, we and everyone who’s forecasting these—what,\nwhat we’re all doing is, we are looking at the—at the amount of savings. We’re looking at—you\nPage 27 of 30\nMarch 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nknow, we have reasonably good data on that. And we’re looking at the government transfers\nthat’ll be made as part of the various laws. And we’re trying to make an assessment on what will\nbe the tendency of people to spend that money, the marginal propensity to consume. And from\nthat, you can develop an estimate of the impact on spending, on growth, on hiring, and,\nultimately, on inflation. So that’s, that’s what we’re all doing.\nAnd we have, you know, we have—we can look at history, and we can make estimates,\nand those are all very transparent and public. And you can compare one to the other. And, of\ncourse, we’ve all—we’ve all done that. And I think we’ve made very conservative assumptions\nand sensible mainstream assumptions at each step of that process. And what, what it comes\ndown to is what I said before, which is, there very likely will be a step-up in inflation as March\nand April of last year drop out of the 12-month window, because they were very low inflation\nnumbers. That’s a—that’ll be a fairly significant pop in inflation. It’ll wear off quickly, though,\nbecause it—just the way the numbers are calculated.\nPast that, as the economy reopens, people will start spending more, and then, you know,\nyou can only go out to dinner once per night, but a lot of people can go out to dinner. And so—\nand they’re not doing that now. They’re not going to restaurants, not going to theaters. That part\nof the economy—and travel and hotels—that part of the economy is, is really not functioning at,\nat full capacity, right? But as that happens, people can start to spend. It’s also—wouldn’t be\nsurprising if—and you’re seeing this now, particularly in the goods economy—there’ll be\nbottlenecks. They won’t be—they won’t be able to service all of the demand maybe, maybe for\na period. So those things could lead to—and we’ve, we’ve modeled that. Other people have too.\nWe’ve—and what we see is relatively modest increases in inflation. So—but those are not\npermanent things.\nPage 28 of 30\nMarch 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nYou know, what’ll, what’ll happen is—the supply side—the supply side in the United\nStates is very dynamic. People start businesses, they, they reopen restaurants, you know, the\nairlines are, will be flying again, all of those things will happen. And so it’ll turn out to be a\none—a one-time sort of bulge in, in prices, but it won’t change inflation going forward, because\ninflation expectations are strongly anchored around 2 percent. We know that inflation dynamics\ndo evolve over time. And there was a time when, when inflation went up, it would stay up.\nAnd, and that time is not now. That hasn’t been the case for some decades. And we think it\nwon’t—it won’t—we won’t suddenly change to another regime.\nThese things tend to change over time. And they tend to—tend to change when the\ncentral bank doesn’t understand that having inflation expectations anchored at 2 percent is the\nkey to it all. The, the—having them anchored at 2 percent is what gives us the ability to push\nhard when the economy’s really weak. If we saw inflation expectations moving materially above\n2 percent, of course, we would conduct policy in a way that would, would make sure that that\ndidn’t happen. We’re committed to having inflation expectations anchored at 2 percent, not\nmaterially above or below 2 percent.\nSo that’s—I think if you—if you look at the savings, look at all of that, model it, that’s,\nthat’s kind of what comes out of our assessment. There are different possibilities. I think it’s,\nit’s a relatively unusual—very unusual situation to have all these savings and this, this amount of\nfiscal support and monetary policy support. Nonetheless, that, that is our most likely case. And\nyou know, as the—as the data come in and the economy performs, we’ll of course adjust. Our\noutcome-based guidance will immediately adapt, we think, to meet whatever the actual path of\nthe economy is.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We’ll go to Scott Horsley for the last question.\nPage 29 of 30\nMarch 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nSCOTT HORSLEY. Thanks, Chairman Powell. My question is about those supply\nchain bottlenecks, especially on the goods side. Are they getting better, or are they getting\nworse? We saw they were sort of a drag on the industrial production numbers we—that came\nout yesterday. And what do you expect them to do to prices in, in—just in the short run?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, I have to say, I think it’s impossible to say, frankly, with\nany confidence, but I, I would expect it’s very possible—let’s put it that way—that you will see\nbottlenecks emerge and then clear over time. And you’ll probably see that over a period of time,\nbecause, you know, really, the, the strong data are ahead of us. You know, you’re, you’re—right\nnow the, the checks are going out just, just now. And that’ll, that’ll add to spending. COVID\ncases are coming down. Vaccination is moving, now, quickly. You know, the, the really strong\neconomic data is coming. It should be coming, assuming we stay on this track. And that’s when\nyou’ll really know where, where the bottlenecks are.\nBut you can see, though, that they’re not—these are not permanent. It’s not like the\nsupply side will be unable to adapt to these things. It will—the market will clear. It just may\ntake some time. And, and some of the answer to that may be price. In many cases, it won’t be\nprice. You’ll see that people are reluctant to raise prices. You know, it’s a little bit the story\nabout, you know, the wage—the wage Phillips curve does show that as unemployment goes\ndown, wages move up. But companies choose not to try to, to pass that, that price increase along\nto their customers. So you’ll see a lot of that here too, I think. Anyway, we’ll, we’ll see. But\nthat’s, that’s my basic, basic sense. Thank you very much.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you.\nPage 30 of 30"

Amid progress on vaccinations and\nstrong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have\nstrengthened. The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic remain weak but\nhave shown improvement. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors.\nOverall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy\nmeasures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and\nbusinesses.\nThe path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus,\nincluding progress on vaccinations. The ongoing public health crisis continues to\nweigh on the economy, and risks to the economic outlook remain.\nThe Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate\nof 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation running persistently below this\nlonger-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above\n2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer‑term\ninflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. The Committee expects to\nmaintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are\nachieved. The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate\nat 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until\nlabor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s\n(more)\nFor release at 2 p.m. EDT April 28, 2021\n-2-\nassessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on\ntrack to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.

    "press_conf": "April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nTranscript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference\nApril 28, 2021\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed\nto achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and\nprice stability.\nToday my colleagues on the FOMC and I kept interest rates near zero and maintained our\nsizable asset purchases. These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and on\nour balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to deliver powerful support to\nthe economy until the recovery is complete.\nWidespread vaccinations, along with unprecedented fiscal policy actions, are also\nproviding strong support to the recovery. Since the beginning of the year, indicators of\neconomic activity and employment have strengthened. Household spending on goods has risen\nrobustly. The housing sector has more than fully recovered from the downturn, while business\ninvestment and manufacturing production have also increased. Spending on services has also\npicked up, including at restaurants and bars. More generally, the sectors of the economy most\nadversely affected by the pandemic remain weak but have shown improvement. While the\nrecovery has progressed more quickly than generally expected, it remains uneven and far from\ncomplete.\nThe path of the economy continues to depend significantly on the course of the virus and\nthe measures undertaken to control its spread. Since March, progress on vaccinations has limited\nthe number of new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. While the level of new cases remains\nconcerning, especially as it reflects the spread of more infectious strains of the virus, continued\nvaccinations should allow for a return to more normal economic conditions later this year. In the\nPage 1 of 29\nApril 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nmeantime, continued observance of public health and safety guidance will help us reach that goal\nas soon as possible.\nAs with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have continued to\nimprove. Employment rose 916,000 in March, as the leisure and hospitality sector posted a\nnotable gain for the second consecutive month. Nonetheless, employment in this sector is still\nmore than 3 million below its level at the onset of the pandemic. For the economy as a whole,\npayroll employment is 8.4 million below its pre-pandemic level. The unemployment rate\nremained elevated at 6 percent in March, and this figure understates the shortfall in employment,\nparticularly as participation in the labor market remains notably below pre-pandemic levels.\nThe economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to\nshoulder the burden have been the hardest hit. In particular, the high level of joblessness has\nbeen especially severe for lower-wage workers in the service sector and for African Americans\nand Hispanics. The economic dislocation has upended many lives and created great uncertainty\nabout the future.\nReadings on inflation have increased and are likely to rise somewhat further before\nmoderating. In the near term, 12-month measures of PCE inflation are expected to move above\n2 percent as the very low readings from early in the pandemic fall out of the calculation and past\nincreases in oil prices pass through to consumer energy prices. Beyond these effects, we are also\nlikely to see upward pressure on prices from the rebound in spending as the economy continues\nto reopen, particularly if supply bottlenecks limit how quickly production can respond in the near\nterm. However, these one-time increases in prices are likely to have only transitory effects on\ninflation.\nPage 2 of 29\nApril 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nThe Fed’s response to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to\npromote the stability of the financial system. As we say in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals\nand Monetary Policy Strategy, we view maximum employment as a broad-based and inclusive\ngoal. Our ability to achieve maximum employment in the years ahead depends importantly on\nhaving longer-term inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent.\nAs the Committee reiterated in today’s policy statement, with inflation running\npersistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for\nsome time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations\nremain well anchored at 2 percent. We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary\npolicy until these employment and inflation outcomes are achieved. With regard to interest rates,\nwe continue to expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range\nfor the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the\nCommittee’s assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on\ntrack to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. I would note that a transitory rise in\ninflation above 2 percent this year would not meet this standard.\nIn addition, we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least\n$80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per\nmonth until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum-employment and\nprice-stability goals. The increase in our balance sheet since March 2020 has materially eased\nfinancial conditions and is providing substantial support to the economy. The economy is a long\nway from our goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be\nachieved.\nPage 3 of 29\nApril 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nOur guidance for interest rates and asset purchases ties the path of the federal funds rate\nand the size of the balance sheet to our employment and inflation goals. This outcome-based\nguidance will ensure that the stance of monetary policy remains highly accommodative as the\nrecovery progresses.\nTo conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses\nacross the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do\neverything we can to support the economy for as long as it takes to complete the recovery.\nThank you. I look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Chair. First we’ll go Paul Kiernan.\nPAUL KIERNAN. Hi, Chairman Powell. Thanks for doing this. I guess, since I’m first,\nI’ll go ahead and re-up Howard’s question from the last press conference: Is it time to start\ntalking about talking about tapering yet? Have you and your colleagues had any conversations to\nthis effect? Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. Thank you. So, no, it is not time yet. We’ve said that we would let\nthe public know when it is time to have that conversation, and we said we’d do that well in\nadvance of any actual decision to taper our asset purchases, and we will do so. In the meantime,\nwe’ll be monitoring progress toward our goals. We first articulated this “substantial further\nprogress” test at our December meeting. Economic activity and hiring have just recently picked\nup after slowing over the winter. And it will take some time before we see substantial further\nprogress.\nPAUL KIERNAN. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Jonnelle at Reuters.\nPage 4 of 29\nApril 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nJONNELLE MARTE. Okay. Hi. Thank you so much. My question is about what’s\ngoing on with the virus, and what if we don’t reach a level of herd immunity, per se. So, in your\nscenario, thinking about the outlook and the economy, do you have some model where you\nmight start to still normalize policy even if there’s like a baseline of infection still going on? Or\nhow can you, you know, talk about how you’re weighing those things?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes, so we have to leave questions about herd immunity and what\nthat looks like to the health experts, but, but I would certainly say that what matters the most to\nthe economic recovery continues to be controlling the virus. The economy can’t fully recover\nuntil people are confident that it’s safe to resume activities involving crowds of people. There\nmay be people who are around the edges of the labor force who won’t come back in unless they\nfeel really comfortable going back to their old jobs, for example, and there, there may be parts of\nthe economy that will—that just won’t be able to, to really fully reengage until the pandemic is\ndecisively behind us.\nBut, you know, we’ve articulated particular guidance for tapering our asset purchases and\nfor lifting off and raising interest rates. So for, for asset purchases, we’ve said that we would\ncontinue at the current pace of asset purchases until we see substantial further progress toward\nour goals. So—and that is, that is what it is, substantial further progress. For interest rates, as\nI—as I said a moment ago, we want to see labor market conditions consistent with maximum\nemployment, we want to see inflation at 2 percent, and we want to see it on track to exceed\n2 percent. So those are our tests. We don’t have an independent test to do with the virus. I will\nsay, though, as I—as I started with, you know, the, the path of the virus is going to have an effect\non our ability to achieve both of those tests.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Great. Thank you. Jeanna.\nPage 5 of 29\nApril 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Chair Powell. Thanks for taking our questions. I wonder if\nyou could talk a little bit about that test for raising interest rates that you just elaborated. You’ve\nobviously made it very clear that you want to see improvements in the real economy and the real\ndata and not in just sort of expectations data before making that move. But I guess I wonder\nwhat happens if inflation expectations were to move up before you see some sort of return to full\nemployment. You know, it seems like a lot of sort of the stability in inflation has been tied to the\nfact that those have been so low and stable, and I guess I wonder how, how your reaction would\nbe—sort of how your reaction to that is, is—how you’re thinking about that.\nCHAIR POWELL. Right. So it seems unlikely, frankly, that we would see inflation\nmoving up in a persistent way that would actually move inflation expectations up while there\nwas still significant slack in the labor market. I won’t say that it’s impossible, but it, it seems—it\nseems unlikely. It’s much more likely that we would—having achieved maximum-employment\nconditions—we’d also be seeing 2 percent inflation and be on track to see inflation moving\nabove 2 percent. They tend to move together. So that’s not to say inflation won’t—might not\nmove up, but for inflation to move up in a persistent way that, that really starts to move inflation\nexpectations up, that would have to—that would take some time. And you would think that, that\nit would be quite likely that, that we’d be in very strong labor markets for that to be happening.\nIf it—if that actually were to happen, though, there is a—there’s a paragraph in the—in\nthe Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy which says that when the two\ngoals are somewhat in conflict, we weigh various factors, including the, the time it would take to\nget back and [so] forth. So we do—it doesn’t really tell you what to do, but it tells you that we\nwill weigh those two factors and how far we are away from them and how long it would take to\nreach them were we to reach that sort of pretty unlikely state.\nPage 6 of 29\nApril 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Steve Liesman.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I want to follow up on Jonnelle’s\nquestion, and I wonder if you can help us understand better your thinking about how COVID\ninfection rates and the virus calibrate with monetary policy. As you recall, we had a major\nresurgence in the virus last fall. And I’m wondering, would you need to be assured that there\nwasn’t such a resurgence coming before you began—I mean, for lack of a better term—thinking\nabout thinking about tapering? And what kind of comfort level would you need? Would it be\nsomething that would be declared from the CDC or the, or the World Health Organization—for\nexample, downgrading the virus from a pandemic—before you have the comfort level to reverse\ncourse on policy? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes. We, we really have—just articulated the goals that I’ve—that\nI’ve just mentioned a couple of times, which is substantial further progress toward our goals\nbefore we taper. Now, that’s very likely—for us to achieve that, it’s very likely going to be the\ncase that we’ve also made really significant progress on controlling the virus through vaccination\nand, and other—it, it—you know, those two things should more or less coexist.\nWe haven’t articulated a separate test for a state of the virus that we’d like to achieve\nbecause we’re not—you know, we’re not experts in that area. We’re, we’re really focused on the\neconomic outcomes, and, again, my, my guess is that we—it’s very likely, it seems to me, that\nfor us to achieve the economic outcomes, we would need to taper or to raise interest rates. We\nwould also have to have made very substantial progress in getting the virus under control—not,\nnot necessarily fully under control. There is a, a possibility, of course, that we will, will have\nongoing outbreaks over the summer and various regional outbreaks and potentially next winter\nPage 7 of 29\nApril 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nas well. But we’ll be looking for substantial progress toward our goal—substantial further\nprogress toward our goals as we think about tapering asset purchases.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Chair Powell. I wanted to ask, you’ve talked a lot during this\ncrisis about the need to have a lot of help from fiscal policy and monetary policy to make sure\nthat there’s not long-term scarring in the economy. And I was just wondering, you know, given\nall of the policies that have been put in place, do you expect there to still be some long-term\nscarring? And, if so, you know, what are you most worried about? Where are you most worried\nabout that showing up?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I would say that we were very worried about scarring, both in the\nlabor market from people being out of—out of the labor market for an extended period of time.\nThe evidence is clear that it becomes much more difficult if you’re out for a long time to get\nback in and get back to the life that you had. Same thing with these small businesses, many of\nwhich are the work of generations. Were we going to wipe out many of those unnecessarily?\nThat was a big concern.\nI would say that, so far, you know, here we are in late April of 2021. We haven’t\nexperienced that level of scarring either in the labor market or among smaller businesses. So\nwe’re not living that, that downside case that we were very concerned about a year ago.\nNotwithstanding that, we’re a long way from full employment. We’re—you know, payroll jobs\nare 8.4 million below where they were in February of 2020. We’ve got a long ways to go. And\nalso, it’s going to be a different economy.\nPage 8 of 29\nApril 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nSo we’ve been hearing a lot from companies that they are—they’ve been looking at\ndeploying better technology and perhaps fewer people, including in some of the service\nindustries that have been employing a lot of people. You know, it, it may well be—it seems\nquite likely that a number of the people who, who had those service-sector jobs will struggle to\nfind the same job and may need time to find work and get back to the working life they had.\nThese were people who were working in February of 2020. They clearly want to work. So those\npeople are going to need—they’re going to need help.\nAnd so, while I would say we haven’t seen really highly elevated levels of\nunemployment for—you know, up in the teens that we thought we might have for an extended\nperiod of time, we’ve still got a lot of people who are out to—out of work. We want to get them\nback to work as quickly as possible, and that’s really one of the things we’re trying to achieve\nwith our policy.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Rachel Siegel.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Thank you, Michelle, and thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our\nquestions. The housing market in many American cities is seeing booming prices, bidding wars,\nand all-cash offers well above asking price. And this is happening at the same time that housing\nis becoming much more expensive for lower-income Americans and people who are still\nstruggling from the pandemic. Do you have concerns that there are localized housing bubbles\nor that there’s the potential for that, and what is the Fed doing to monitor or address this?\nThank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So we do monitor the housing market very carefully, of course. And\nI would say that, before the pandemic, it’s a very different housing market than it was before the\nGlobal Financial Crisis. And one of the main differences was that households were in very good\nPage 9 of 29\nApril 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nshape financially compared to where they were. In addition, most people who got mortgages\nwere people with pretty high credit scores. There wasn’t the subprime—you know, low-doc,\nno-doc lending practices were not there. So we don’t have that kind of thing where we have a\nhousing bubble where people are overlevered and owning a lot of houses.\nThere’s no question, though, that housing prices are going up, and so we’re watching that\ncarefully. It’s, it’s partly because there’s, there’s clearly strong demand, and there’s just not a lot\nof supply right now. So builders are, you know, struggling to keep up with the demand, clearly.\nInventories are tremendously low. We’re, we’re all hearing those stories. And if you’re—if\nyou’re an entry level housing buyer, this is—this is a problem, because it just is going to be that\nmuch harder for people to get that first house, and that’s a problem. I mean, we—it’s part of a\nstrong economy, with people having money to spend and wanting to invest in housing. So, in\nthat sense, it’s good. It’s clearly the strongest housing market that we’ve seen since the Global\nFinancial Crisis. And, you know, my hope would be that, over time, housing builders can react\nto this demand and, and come up with more supply and workers will come back to work in that\nindustry.\nSo, you know, it is—it’s not an unalloyed good to have prices going up this much, and\nwe’re watching it very carefully. I don’t see the kind of financial stability current concerns,\nthough, that really do reside around the housing sector. So many of the financial crackups in all\ncountries, all western countries, that have happened in the last 30 years have been around\nhousing. We don’t—we really don’t see that here. We don’t see bad loans and unsustainable\nprices and that kind of thing.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Chris Rugaber, Associated Press.\nPage 10 of 29\nApril 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHRIS RUGABER. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the labor\nmarket. Do you—do you see things, such as in the Beige Book—you saw in the Beige Book\nanecdotes about businesses not able to find workers, [inaudible] back to the labor market for fear\nof getting sick, childcare concerns, and so forth. Do you see these as also just sort of temporary\nbottlenecks that won’t have much effect on the long-term health of the labor market? Or how are\nyou thinking about these kinds of issues?\nCHAIR POWELL. Chris, you were breaking up a little there, but I think I did get your\nquestion. So I think there are a number of—a number of things going on there: the tension\nbetween a high level of unemployment and yet many, many companies saying they can’t find—\nan elevated number of companies saying that they can’t find workers. So, what’s really going on\nthere?\nIt, it should be a number of different things. There are workers who don’t actually have\nthe specific skills that the employers are looking for. There may be geographical differences. It,\nit may also be that, for example, there—one big factor would be, schools aren’t open yet, so\nthere are still people who are at home taking care of their children and would like to be back in\nthe workforce but can’t be yet. There are people afraid of—there are virus fears that are\nweighing on people, so some—some people don’t want to go back to work. There are also a\nsignificant number of people who say they’ve retired—a large number of people that say that\nthey’re retired. Now, it’s hard to say whether they will come back in as the labor market\nstrengthens and as COVID, you know, becomes a—in the rearview mirror, in the history books,\nif you will.\nSo—but clearly there’s something going, going on out there, as, as many companies are\nreporting labor shortages. We don’t see wages moving up yet, and presumably we would see\nPage 11 of 29\nApril 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthat in a real—you know, in a really tight labor market. And we may well start to see that. I do\nthink—so what will happen—what we saw during the last expansion, and it may be a different\nexpansion, we don’t know, but, but what we saw was that labor supply generally showed up. In\nother words, if you were worried about there—about running out of workers, it seemed like we\nnever did. You know, labor force participation held up. People came in the labor force. They\nstayed in the labor force longer than expected.\nSo my guess would be that you will see people coming back into the labor force, and\nthese jobs will be—the labor market will reach equilibrium. Maybe pay will go up. But I do\nthink that—and I do think also that unemployment insurance benefits will run out in September,\nso to the extent that’s a factor, which is not clear, it will no longer be a factor fairly soon. So my\nguess is, it will come back to this economy where we have, you know, equilibrium between labor\nsupply and labor demand. It may take some months, though.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Heather Scott.\nCHRIS RUGABER. Could I do a quick follow-up?\nMICHELLE SMITH. I’m sorry. Go ahead. Go ahead, Chris.\nCHRIS RUGABER. Well [extended pause]\nMICHELLE SMITH. We, we lost you, Chris. Let’s go on to Heather.\nHEATHER SCOTT. Thank you. Good afternoon, Chair Powell. I wanted to ask you,\nyou know, you’ve been hearing, of course, these concerns raised by Larry Summers and others\nabout inflation and the fact that they think the Fed might be—might let things get out of hand\nwith the new policy stance. So my question is, can you tell us, what is different this time versus\nprevious periods like in the ’60s when inflation got out of control? Why are you confident with,\nPage 12 of 29\nApril 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nwith the lags in monetary policy that the Fed can get ahead of inflation and, and make sure it\ndoesn’t go too far above the 2 percent target?\nCHAIR POWELL. Thanks for your question. So I actually have a couple things I’d like\nto say about inflation, including addressing your question. So let me start with just saying that\nwe’re very strongly committed to achieving our objectives of maximum employment and price\nstability. Our, our price stability goal is 2 percent inflation over the longer run, and we believe\nthat having inflation average 2 percent over time will help anchor long-term inflation\nexpectations at 2 percent. With inflation having run persistently below 2 percent for some time,\nthe Committee seeks inflation moderately above inflation for two times—above 2 percent for\nsome time.\nSo, with a, a little bit of context, we’re, we’re making our way through an unprecedented\nseries of events, really, in which a synchronized global shutdown is now giving way to\nwidespread reopening of economies in many places around the world. In the United States,\nfiscal and monetary policy continue to provide strong support: Vaccinations are now\nwidespread, and the economy is beginning to move ahead with real momentum. During this\ntime of reopening, we are likely to see some upward pressure on prices, and I’ll discuss why.\nBut those pressures are likely to be temporary as they are associated with the reopening process.\nIn an episode of one-time price increases as the economy reopens is not the same thing\nas, and is not likely to lead to, persistently higher year-over-year inflation into the future—\ninflation at levels that are not consistent with our goal of 2 percent inflation over time. Indeed, it\nis the Fed’s job to make sure that that does not happen. If, if, contrary to expectations, inflation\nwere to move persistently and materially above 2 percent in a manner that threatened to move\nlonger-term inflation expectations materially above 2 percent, we would use our tools to bring\nPage 13 of 29\nApril 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ninflation and expectations down to mandate-consistent levels. And I would say, if I may, that is\na principal difference from—we’re all very familiar at the Fed with the history of the 1960s and\n’70s, of course. And we know that our job is to achieve 2 percent inflation over time. We’re\ncommitted to that, and we will use our tools to do that. So that’s a very different situation than\nyou had back in the 1960s—or many, many differences, actually.\nSo let me talk quickly about the two reasons—two, or you could say three, but really two\nmain reasons why we think inflation will move up in the near term. The first is the base effects.\nTwelve-month measures of inflation are likely to move well above 2 percent over the next few\nmonths as the very low inflation readings recorded in March and April of last year drop out of\nthe calculation. That process has already started to show up. You saw it in the March CPI\nreading, and you’ll see it later this week in the PCE price data. These base effects will contribute\nabout 1 percentage point to headline inflation and about 0.7 percentage point to core inflation in\nApril and May. So, significant increases, and they’ll disappear over the following months. And\nthey’ll be transitory. They carry no implication for the rate of inflation in later periods. So that’s\nbase effects.\nThe other big one I would talk about is bottlenecks. So this is what we’re seeing in\nsupply chains in various industries, and we’re, we’re in close touch with all of these industries.\nYou know, the Fed has a network of contacts that is unequaled in businesses and in nonprofits\nfor that matter, too. So what do we mean by a bottleneck? A bottleneck really is a temporary\nblockage or restriction in the supply chain for, for a particular good or goods, something that\nslows down the process of producing goods and delivering them to the market. We think of\nbottlenecks as things that, in their nature, will be resolved as workers and businesses adapt, and\nwe think of them as not calling for a change in monetary policy since they’re temporary and\nPage 14 of 29\nApril 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nexpected to resolve themselves. We know that the base effects will disappear in a few months.\nIt’s much harder to predict with confidence the amount of time it will take to resolve the\nbottlenecks, or for that matter, the temporary effects that they will have on prices in the\nmeantime.\nSo, you know, I’ll just sum up and say, we understand our job. We will do our job. And\nwe are, we are focused—as you’ve seen, for many years, we’ve been focused on inflation\ndeviating below 2 percent, and we used our tools aggressively to keep it back up at 2 percent. If,\nif we see inflation moving materially above 2 percent in a persistent way that risks inflation\nexpectations drifting up, then we will use our tools to guide inflation and expectations back down\nto 2 percent. No one should doubt that we will do that. This is not what we expect. But no one\nshould doubt that, in the event, we would be prepared to use our tools.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. James Politi.\nJAMES POLITI. Chair Powell, you said a few weeks ago that it would—thank you,\nChair Powell. You said a few weeks ago that it would take a string of months of job creation of\nabout a million to achieve progress towards your goal. Can you define what your, what your\ndefinition of “a string of months” is more specifically? And, on inflation, the FOMC said the\nrise in inflation we’re beginning to see largely reflects transitory factors, as you just described.\nBut why use the word “largely,” and what are the factors driving higher prices that may not be\ntransitory, based on the initial data that you’re seeing?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, what is “a string”? What do I mean by “a string”? Well, I would\nsay, what we have right now is one really good—I can tell you what it’s not. It’s not one really\ngood employment reading, which is what we got in March. We got close to a million jobs in\nMarch and a very strong labor market reading. And I was just suggesting that we’d want to see\nPage 15 of 29\nApril 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nmore like that. We’re 8½ million jobs below where we were in February of 2020, and that\ndoesn’t account for growth in the labor force and growth in the economy, that trend we were on.\nSo we have—we’re a long way from our, our goals. And we don’t have to get all the way to our\ngoals to taper asset purchases, we just need to make substantial further progress. It’s going to\ntake some time.\nOn, on “largely,” there are a bunch of factors. I was really thinking—we were thinking\nof the base effects and also the energy effects. I wasn’t meaning to say there are some real\neffects. I mean, there are always—there are always relative prices going up and down within\ninflation. You know, there’s a basket for CPI or PCE. There are, you know, many, many, many\nfactors that go into it. Relative prices are always moving up and down. This, this—we think it’s,\nit’s very fair to say that the increases we see and, frankly, are about to see later this week are\nlargely due to base effects. It would have been more contentious to say “entirely due to base\neffects” because there are some things that are always going up, and so we just said “largely.”\nMICHELLE SMITH. [Inaudible]\nCATARINA SARAIVA. Hi, Chair Powell. Thanks for taking our questions. Over the\npast decade, the Fed has invested significant resources in large-scale bank supervision—has\ncompletely overhauled that approach. And it’s even created a special committee that looks\nhorizontally across the largest banks to find common risks. Did the Fed not see that multiple\nbanks had large exposures to Archegos? If not, why not? And then, what regulatory changes\nwould you like to see implemented to change that going forward?\nCHAIR POWELL. We’re, we, we supervise banks to make sure that they have risk-\nmanagement systems in place so that they can spot these things. We don’t manage their\ncompanies for them or, or try to manage individual risks. In the grand scheme of these large\nPage 16 of 29\nApril 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ninstitutions, the Archegos risks were not systemically important or were not of the size that they\nwould have really created trouble for any of those institutions.\nWhat was troubling, though, was that this could happen in a business for a number of\nfirms that is thought to be—to carry relatively well understood risks. The prime brokerage\nbusiness is, is a well understood business, and so it was surprising that a number of them would\nhave had this. And it was essentially, I believe, the fact that, that they had the same big risk\nposition on with a number of firms, and they weren’t—some of the firms were not aware that\nthere were other firms that had those things. I, I wouldn’t say it’s in any way an indictment of\nour supervision of these firms. It, it—in some cases, it may be they were—it seems as though\nthere were risk-management breakdowns at some of the firms, not all of them. And that’s what\nwe’re looking into.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Nancy Marshall-Genzer.\nNANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Hi, Chair Powell. I—I’m wondering, are you\nplanning to visit the homeless encampment that’s near the Fed in Washington that you drive by?\nHave you been invited, and if you went, what would you be looking to learn there?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, frankly, yes. I have not had a chance to do it yet, but I’ve\nbeen very busy, but I will visit. I don’t want to visit it at a time of a lot of media attention,\nbecause I don’t want that to be part of the story. But I will—I will go visit when, when it’s no\nlonger a, a news story. And I—you know, I—I’ve met with homeless people many times, a\nnumber of times, anyway, let’s say. And I, I think it’s always good to talk to people and hear\nwhat’s going on in their lives. What you find out is, they’re you. They’re just us. I mean,\nthey’re, they’re—these are people who, in many cases, had jobs and, you know, they have lives,\nand they’ve just, they’ve just found themselves in this place. It’s, it’s a—it’s a difficult problem,\nPage 17 of 29\nApril 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthough. You know, there are many, many facets of it, and I’m well aware that this is not\nsomething that the Fed has all the tools for or anything like that. But I, I will do that when, when\nthe need arises and when, when it’s not so much, you know, in the public eye.\nNANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. And is there anything specifically that you would be\nlooking to learn there?\nCHAIR POWELL. Not really. I mean, I, I think I know what I’ll find there. I, I think\nyou, you connect with these people and what you—again, what you find is, they’re like you.\nThat could be you. I mean, that could be your sister. That could be, you know, your kid. You,\nyou always feel that way in that sort of an encounter, and, you know, it just is a—it’s a—it’s an\nimportant thing to engage in, I think. And I think, you know, we bring that understanding into\nour lives and, frankly, into our work—the work that we do as well.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Hannah Lang.\nHANNAH LANG. Hi. I wanted to ask about digital currency. You previously said a\nfew times that you think it’s important for the U.S. to get a central bank digital currency right\nrather than be first. But with countries like China moving very quickly on CBDC, I was\nwondering what you think the risks are of, of moving too slow on, on digital currency.\nCHAIR POWELL. Right. So I think the first thing to say is that we feel an obligation to\nunderstand the technology and all of the policy issues very, very well. Central bank digital\ncurrencies are now possible, and we’re going to see some of them around the world. And we\nneed to understand whether that’s something that would be a good thing for the people that we\nserve. How would it work in our system? And there are some very, very difficult questions to\nanswer, but I think we—and we are engaged in a serious program to understand both the\ntechnology and the policy issues.\nPage 18 of 29\nApril 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nI am—I would say this: We’re the world’s reserve currency, and that means that the\ndollar is used in transactions all around the world, far more than any other currency. And that’s\nbecause of our rule of law; our democratic institutions, which are the best in the world; our\neconomy; our industrious people; all the things that make the United States the United States.\nThat’s why we’re the, the reserve currency. And, of course, we have open capital accounts,\nwhich is essential if you’re going to be the reserve currency. So those are the factors that make\nus the reserve currency.\nI am—I’m less concerned that someone—that another country might have a digital\ncurrency first. You know, ask yourself the question, does that mean that, if you were a company\nthat’s doing international business, would you then suddenly start to use that currency to use\nyour—do your international transactions, or would you still do them in dollars, where, where—\nwhich is what everyone does? And I’m not so concerned about, about that. I am really\nconcerned about getting it right.\nIt is—it is a—it is a tricky set of questions that we have to navigate in a world where we\nalready have, remember, a highly evolved payment system. We have FedNow and other\nimmediately available funds. Pretty soon everybody will be able to, to do what people do in\nother parts of the world, which is just use their phone to make immediately available payments\nall the time. It’ll be normal. And what would be the role of a central bank digital currency in\nthat kind of an environment? Far more important to get it right than it is to do it fast or feel that\nwe need to rush to reach conclusions because other countries are moving ahead.\nI mean, that—what the China—the currency that’s being used in China is not one that\nwould—that would work here. It’s, it’s one that really allows the government to see every\npayment that’s used—for which it is used in real time. It’s much more to do with things that are\nPage 19 of 29\nApril 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nhappening within their own financial system than it is, I think, to do with, with the global—you\nknow, sort of global competition.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Michael Derby.\nMICHAEL DERBY. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask you another\nquestion about inflation, and it has to do with inflation expectations. A number of different\nsurveys and, and market indicators are showing, you know, multiyear highs in inflation\nexpectations ratings. So I wondered, you know, if, if that was something that you saw consistent\nwith your inflation outlook. Is that something that worries you, or do you see that as, maybe,\nyou know, the success of the Fed’s new inflation framework, you know, making it out to the, to\nthe broader public?\nCHAIR POWELL. Right. Inflation expectations before the pandemic hit—and here we\nthink of survey, market based—survey being either households or, or economists and, and\nmarket based. You look at all of those, and I would say that they were at the low end of what\nwould have been consistent with a 2 percent inflation target, particularly our 2 percent inflation\ntarget, which calls for 2 percent average inflation. So they’re at the low end. Inflation\nexpectations actually went down a bit at the beginning of the pandemic, and now they’ve just\nmoved back up to levels broadly—that, that are where they were in 2018, or in some cases 2014,\nand, I would say, more consistent with our mandate.\nAnd we want them to be—we want them to be higher and—you know, on a persistent\nbasis. We want inflation to run a little bit higher than it has been running for the last quarter of a\ncentury. We want it to average 2 percent, not 1.7 percent. And for that, we need to see inflation\nexpectations that are consistent with that, really well anchored at 2 percent. We don’t really see\nthat yet, but I would say that, that, you know, breakevens have moved up, in a way. Breakevens\nPage 20 of 29\nApril 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nare based on CPI, of course, but they’re, they’re now at levels that are—that are pretty close to\nmandate consistent, whereas before, they were below. We monitor inflation expectations very,\nvery carefully, as you would obviously know. So that’s where—that’s where I would say it is.\nMICHAEL DERBY. Just one small follow-up. Do you have any redlines on inflation\nreadings where if, you know, you hit, like, a certain number on, say, you know, core PCE, that\nwould be, you know, a trigger response from the Fed?\nCHAIR POWELL. It doesn’t work that way. You know, we’re, we’re—inflation\nmeasures are always going to be a bit volatile. We expect—as I mentioned, we expect core and,\nand headline PCE to move up because of base effects, and—you know, I—and we expect that to\ngo away. We, we also expect these, these bottleneck effects to come in. We don’t know how\npersistent they’ll be. We, we think they’ll—you know, it’s a matter of, of when they will pass\nthrough, not whether they will pass through. But we can’t be confident about the exact timing of\nthat or the size of them. They don’t seem especially large at the moment, but, you know, we, we\ndon’t know.\nI mean, you know, this is—this is all about the reopening of the economy. That’s what’s\nhappening. We had it—we were in a deep, deep hole a year ago, and now, with a lot of help\nfrom fiscal policy, some additional help from monetary policy, and, you know, a great deal of\nhelp from vaccination, we’re seeing a strong rebound in activity. And what’s happening is, it’s,\nit’s—demand can be spurred with fiscal transfers and—the saved-up fiscal transfers and, and\npeople going back to work and things like that. The supply side will take a little bit of time to\nadapt. New restaurants will have to be opened. The supply of various inputs into the goods part\nof the economy will have to be brought back up to speed. And you—you’re seeing some of that.\nPage 21 of 29\nApril 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nThat’ll happen over a period of time, over coming quarters. You’ll see some of the bottlenecks\nresolved, but the last one may not be resolved for some time.\nMICHAEL DERBY. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Brian Cheung.\nBRIAN CHEUNG. Brian Cheung with—hi, Chairman Powell. Brian Cheung with\nYahoo Finance. I wanted to ask about financial stability, which is a part of the Fed’s reaction\nfunction here. It seems like to people on the outside who might not follow finance daily, they’re\npaying attention to things like GameStop, now Dogecoin. And it seems like there’s interesting\nreach for yield in this market—to some extent, also Archegos. So does the Fed see a relationship\nbetween low rates and easy policy to those things, and is there a financial stability concern from\nthe Fed’s perspective at this time?\nCHAIR POWELL. Right. So we look at—financial stability for us is really—we have a\nbroad framework, so we don’t just jump from one thing to another. I know many people just\nlook at asset prices, and they look at some of the things that are going on in the—in the equity\nmarkets, which, which I think do reflect froth in the equity markets. But really, it—really, we try\nto stick to a framework for financial stability so we can—so we can talk about it the same way\neach time and so we can be held accountable for it.\nSo one of the areas is asset prices, and I would say some of the asset prices are high. You\nare seeing, seeing things in the capital markets that, that are—that are a bit frothy. That’s a fact.\nI won’t say it has nothing to do with monetary policy, but it also—it has a tremendous amount to\ndo with vaccination and reopening of the economy. That’s really what has been moving markets\na lot in the last few months is this turn away from what was a pretty dark winter to now a fast—a\nmuch faster vaccination process and a faster reopening. So that’s, that’s part of what’s going on.\nPage 22 of 29\nApril 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nThe other—the other things, though—you know, leverage in the financial system, is it—\nis, is not a problem. That’s a—that’s a—that was one of the four pillars. Asset prices was one.\nLeverage in the financial system is, is not an issue; we have very well capitalized large banks.\nWe have funding risks for, for our largest financial institutions that are also very low. We do\nhave some funding risk issues around money market funds, but I would say they’re not systemic\nright now.\nAnd, and the household sector is actually in pretty good shape. It was in—it was in a\nvery good shape as a relative matter before the financial crisis—sorry, the pandemic crisis hit.\nThere were real concerns, of course, with high levels of unemployment and loss of wages and all\nof that, that the—that the household sector would, would, would weaken dramatically. That\nhasn’t happened. So, with the fiscal transfers, money that’s on household balance sheets, they’re\nin good shape. You see relatively low defaults and that kind of thing.\nSo the overall financial stability picture is mixed, but, on balance, it’s—you know, it’s\nmanageable, I would say. And it’s—by the way, I think it’s appropriate and important for\nfinancial conditions to remain accommodative to support economic activity. Again, 8½ million\npeople who had jobs in February don’t have them now, and, you know, there’s a long way to go\nuntil we reach our goal. So that’s what I would say.\nBRIAN CHEUNG. As a follow-up, you mentioned money market pressures. The Fed\ndidn’t make changes to interest on reserves or excess reserves. What was the logic behind that?\nIt seems like SOFR has been drifting closer to zero. So just hoping for clarification on that.\nCHAIR POWELL. Right. So the federal funds rate has been well within target and—at\ntarget range, and money market funds—money market conditions are, are fine. We have the\nability to use our administrative tools to make sure that that remains the case. We do expect\nPage 23 of 29\nApril 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nfurther downward pressure on, on rates through asset purchases and also the runoff in the—in the\nTreasury General Account. But, at this point, we didn’t see a need for—to, to deploy our tools\nto, to support rates. And, of course, we will do so if, if the need does arise.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Jean Yung.\nJEAN YUNG. Hi, Chair Powell. I wanted to ask a, a similar question. We are seeing\nelevated market valuations, and some economists are concerned that the economy might\noverheat, at least for a period of time. So should the Fed and other regulators be thinking about\ntightening capital requirements or extending oversight to the nonbank sector so that financial\nstability risks stay as low as they have been? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think capital requirements for banks are, to me—went up\ntremendously, really, over the course of the 10 years between the financial crisis and the arrival\nof the pandemic. And the banks really made it through a real stress test very well and passed\nthree, three of our—two of our stress tests, and that is another one that’s pending. So capital is,\nis in a good place, as far as I’m concerned, in the banking system.\nBut, to your point, what we saw was—so what, what kind of happened during the\npandemic crisis that, that requires attention, and number one is money market funds and\ncorporate bond funds where we saw run dynamics again, and we need to—we’re, we’re looking\nat that. So we’re looking at ways, and people around the world are looking at ways, to make\nthose vehicles resilient so that they don’t have to be, you know, supported by the government\nwhenever there’s, you know, severely stressed market conditions. It’s a private business. They,\nthey need to have the wherewithal to stay in business and not just count on the Fed and others\nto—around the world to come in. So that was that.\nPage 24 of 29\nApril 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nThe other one is Treasury market structure. Dealers are committing less capital to that\nactivity now than they were 10 or 15 years ago, and the need for capital is higher because there’s\nso much more supply of Treasuries. And so there are some questions about Treasury market\nstructure, and there’s a lot of careful work going on to understand whether there’s something we\ncan do about this, because we—you know, the U.S. Treasury market is probably the most single\nimportant—single most important market in, in the economy and the world. It needs to be\nliquid. It needs to function well for the good of our economy and the good of our citizens.\nSo it’s not clear what, what—where that takes you, but we, we are taking a careful\nlook—and the Treasury Department is, is really going to be leading this—at, at Treasury market\nstructure and all of the various aspects of that to make sure that we do have a resilient, strong\nTreasury market that can work even in difficult times. As, as you know, at the very beginning of\nthe financial—of the—of this recent crisis, there was such a demand for selling Treasuries,\nincluding by foreign central banks, that, really, the dealers couldn’t handle the volume. And so\nwhat was happening was, the market was really starting to lose function, and that’s—that was a\nreally serious problem which we had to solve through really massive asset purchases. And, you\nknow, so we’d like to, we’d like to see if there isn’t something we can do to—is—do we need to\nbuild against that kind of an extreme tail risk, and if so, what would that look like?\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Edward Lawrence.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you, Fed Chairman, for the question. So I’m interested\nin your thoughts. There’s so much fiscal help and accommodation from the Federal Reserve.\nYou said today the vaccinations will follow the normal economic conditions or, or lead to more\nnormal economic conditions later this year. When do you see the economy being able to stand\non its own feet, so to speak? And, along those lines, with the fiscal spending and the\nPage 25 of 29\nApril 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\naccommodation you talked about with transitory inflation, does more spending need to be\ninjected into the system, or will that affect that transitory nation—nature of the inflation?\nThank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. When will the economy be, be able to stand on its own feet? I’m not\nsure if—I’m not sure what the exact nature of that question is.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. What, what I’m saying is, is, you know, when will the—when\nwill you need to lower the, the amount of Treasuries you’re buying to sort of taper off a little bit?\nWhen can it stand without having that support from the monetary policy side? And then—and\nthen, further, the transitory.\nCHAIR POWELL. Okay. Sorry. So we have—you know, we’ve articulated our test for\nthat, as you know, and that is just, we’ll continue asset purchases at this pace until we see\nsubstantial further progress. And we’re, we’re going to communicate well in advance of any\ndecision. We’re going to let, you know, the, the public know that that’s what we’re thinking.\nAnd, and so there’ll be a lot of warning and that kind of thing. But it’s about substantial further\nprogress toward our goals. That’s, that’s really all it is. It doesn’t have any, any external, virus-\nrelated specific requirement, although, again, I do think it’ll—you know, the, the virus will need\nto continue to be controlled for us to achieve those economic goals. But it’s really the\neconomic goals.\nNow, your second question. Sorry, just say again. I didn’t quite get that question.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Yes, sure. With all the fiscal spending that’s happened and\nthe accommodation and—does, does the system need more spending either from the fiscal side\nor accommodation, or would more spending affect the transitory nature of the inflation and put\nthose upward, upward pressures on inflation long term?\nPage 26 of 29\nApril 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. So it’s really up to Congress. We—we’re not an adviser to\nCongress. You know, we don’t, we don’t weigh in on specific fiscal bills or proposals. That’s\nreally between elected parties. You know, basically, fiscal policy is the province of people who\nstand for democratic election and win, and they get to make those very difficult decisions, and\nthey get to be accountable to the voters. We didn’t do any of that, and we don’t have a seat at\nthat table. We don’t seek a seat at that table. So that’s really something for Congress and the\nAdministration to, to deal with.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Greg Robb.\nGREG ROBB. Hi, Greg Robb from MarketWatch. Thank you—thank you so much for\nthe—for the opportunity. I wanted to circle back to the housing market. It’s just kind of\nconfusing that the question and your answer—you know, the housing market is strong, prices are\nup. And yet the Fed is buying $40 billion per month in mortgage-related assets. Why is that,\nand are those purchases playing a role at all in pushing up prices? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes. I, I mean, we’re—we started buying MBS because the\nmortgage-backed security market was, was really experiencing severe dysfunction, and we’ve\nsort of, sort of articulated, you know, what our exit path is from that. It’s not meant to provide\ndirect assistance to, to the housing market. That was never the intent. It was really just to keep\nthat as—it’s a very close relation to the Treasury market and a very important market on its own.\nAnd so that’s, that’s why we, we bought as we did during the Global Financial Crisis; we bought\nMBS too. Again, not, not an intention to send help to the housing market, which was, which was\nreally not, not a problem this time at all. So—and, you know, it’s, it’s a situation where we will,\nwe will taper asset purchases when the time comes to do that, and those, those purchases will\ncome to zero over time. And that time is not yet.\nPage 27 of 29\nApril 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nGREG ROBB. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. And for the last question, we’ll go to Mike McKee.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Since I am last, let me go back to\nPaul’s question, the first question, and ask him—ask you whether—not whether you’re thinking\nabout thinking of tapering, but why you’re not. We’re seeing bank lending fall. The markets\nseem to be operating well. Are you afraid of a taper tantrum? Or is it, as one money manager\nput it, “If you get out of the markets, there aren’t enough buyers for all of the Treasury debt, and\nso rates would have to go way up”? The bottom-line question is, what do we get for $120 billion\na month that we couldn’t get for less?\nCHAIR POWELL. So it’s really not more complicated than this. We, we articulated the\n“substantial further progress” test at our December meeting. And, really, for the next couple of\nmonths, we made relatively little progress toward our goals. And, remember, substantial further\nprogress from December—from our December meeting. And then vaccination started to get\nmore widespread. The economy reopened. We got a really nice job report for March. It doesn’t\nconstitute substantial further progress. It’s not close to substantial further progress.\nWe’re hopeful that we will see along this path a way to that goal. And we believe we\nwill; it just is a question of when. And so, when that time—when the time comes for us to talk\nabout talking about it, we’ll do that. And—but that time is not now. It’s—we’re just not—we’re\nnot that far. We’ve had one great jobs report. It’s not enough. You know, we’re going to act on\nactual data, not on our forecast. And we’re just going to need to see more data. That’s—it’s no,\nno more complicated than that.\nPage 28 of 29\nApril 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Well, if you leave rates where they are, it doesn’t change anything.\nBut does it change anything if you actually tapered a bit? If you spent less, would you still get\nthe same effect on the economy?\nCHAIR POWELL. If we bought less? You’re, you’re very faint. So if someone has the\nvolume, they can turn it up. But if we bought less, you know, no. I mean, I think the effect is\nproportional to the amount we buy. It’s, it’s really part of overall accommodative financial\nconditions. We, we have tried to create accommodative financial conditions to support\neconomic activity, and we did that.\nAnd we articulated the—you know, the, the tests for withdrawing that accommodation.\nAnd we think, you know—so we’re waiting to see those tests to be fulfilled both for asset\npurchases and for liftoff of rates. And, you know, when the tests are fulfilled, we’ll, we’ll go\nahead. As we—you know, we’ve done this before. We did it in, in the last—after the last crisis,\nand, you know, we’ll do it in, in maybe—we’ll do it—as those tests are satisfied, we’ll do it.\nAnd the—and the only thing that will guide us is, are the tests met? You know, that, that’s what\nwe focused on: Is—have, have the macroeconomic conditions that we’ve articulated, have they\nbeen realized? That will be the test for, for tapering asset purchases and for raising interest rates.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you very much. Take care.\nCHAIR POWELL. Thank you.\nPage 29 of 29"

    "press_conf": "June 16, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nTranscript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference\nJune 16, 2021\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed\nto achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and\nprice stability.\nToday the Federal Open Market Committee kept interest rates near zero and maintained\nour asset purchases. These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and on our\nbalance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to deliver powerful support to the\neconomy until the recovery is complete.\nWidespread vaccinations, along with unprecedented fiscal policy actions, are also\nproviding strong support to the recovery. Indicators of economic activity and employment have\ncontinued to strengthen, and real GDP this year appears to be on track to post its fastest rate of\nincrease in decades. Much of this rapid growth reflects the continued bounceback in activity\nfrom depressed levels. The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic remain weak but\nhave shown improvement. Household spending is rising at a rapid pace, boosted by the ongoing\nreopening of the economy, fiscal support, and accommodative financial conditions. The housing\nsector is strong, and business investment is increasing at a solid pace. In some industries, near-\nterm supply constraints are restraining activity. Forecasts from FOMC participants for economic\ngrowth this year have been revised up since our March Summary of Economic Projections. Even\nso, the recovery is incomplete, and risks to the economic outlook remain.\nAs with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have continued to\nimprove, although the pace of improvement has been uneven. Employment rose 419,000 per\nmonth, on average, in April and May, with the leisure and hospitality sector continuing to post\nnotable gains. Employment in this sector and the economy as a whole remains well below pre-\nPage 1 of 30\nJune 16, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\npandemic levels. The unemployment rate remained elevated in May at 5.8 percent, and this\nfigure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market\nhas not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year. Factors\nrelated to the pandemic, such as caregiving needs, ongoing fears of the virus, and unemployment\ninsurance payments, appear to be weighing on employment growth. These factors should wane\nin coming months against a backdrop of rising vaccinations, leading to more rapid gains in\nemployment. Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the labor market to continue to\nimprove, with the median projection for the unemployment rate standing at 4.5 percent at the end\nof this year and declining to 3.5 percent by the end of 2023.\nThe economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to\nshoulder the burden have been hardest hit. In particular, despite progress, joblessness continues\nto fall disproportionately on lower-wage workers in the service sector and on African Americans\nand Hispanics.\nInflation has increased notably in recent months. The 12-month change in PCE prices\nwas 3.6 percent in April and will likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating.\nPart of the increase reflects the very low readings from early in the pandemic falling out of the\ncalculation as well as the pass-through of past increases in oil prices to, to consumer energy\nprices. Beyond these effects, we are also seeing upward pressure on prices from the rebound in\nspending as the economy continues to reopen, particularly as supply bottlenecks have limited\nhow quickly production in some sectors can respond in the near term. These bottleneck effects\nhave been larger than anticipated, and FOMC participants have revised up their projections for,\nfor inflation notably for this year. As these transitory supply effects abate, inflation is expected\nPage 2 of 30\nJune 16, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nto drop back toward our longer-run goal, and the median inflation projection falls from\n3.4 percent this year to 2.1 percent next year and 2.2 percent in 2023.\nThe process of reopening the economy is unprecedented, as was the shutdown at the\nonset of the pandemic. As the reopening continues, shifts in demand can be large and rapid, and\nbottlenecks, hiring difficulties, and other constraints could continue to limit how quickly supply\ncan adjust, raising the possibility that inflation could turn out to be higher and more persistent\nthan we expect. Our new framework for monetary policy emphasizes the importance of having\nwell-anchored inflation expectations, both to foster price stability and to enhance our ability to\npromote our broad-based and inclusive maximum-employment goal. Indicators of longer-term\ninflation expectations have generally reversed the declines seen earlier in the pandemic and have\nmoved into a range that appears broadly consistent with our longer-run inflation goal of\n2 percent. If we saw signs that the path of inflation or longer-term inflation expectations were\nmoving materially and persistently beyond levels consistent with our goal, we’d be prepared to\nadjust the stance of monetary policy.\nThe pandemic continues to pose risks to the economic outlook. Progress on vaccinations\nhas limited the spread of COVID-19 and will likely continue to reduce the effects of the public\nhealth crisis on the economy. However, the pace of vaccinations has slowed, and new strains of\nthe virus remain a risk. Continued progress on vaccinations will support a return to more normal\neconomic conditions.\nThe Fed’s policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to\npromote the stability of the financial system. As the Committee reiterated in today’s policy\nstatement, with inflation having run persistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve inflation\nPage 3 of 30\nJune 16, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nmoderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and\nlonger-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. We expect to maintain an\naccommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes are\nachieved. With regard to interest rates, we continue to expect that it will be appropriate to\nmaintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market\nconditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessment of maximum\nemployment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent\nfor some time.\nAs is evident in the SEP, many participants forecast that these favorable economic\nconditions will be met somewhat sooner than previously projected; the median projection for the\nappropriate level of the federal funds rate now lies above the effective lower bound in 2023. Of\ncourse, these projections do not represent a Committee decision or plan, and no one knows with\nany certainty where the economy will be a couple of years from now. More important than any\nforecast is the fact that, whenever liftoff comes, policy will remain highly accommodative.\nReaching the conditions for liftoff will mainly signal that the recovery is strong and no longer\nrequires holding rates near zero.\nIn addition, we are continuing to increase—continuing to increase our holdings of\nTreasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities\nby at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our\nmaximum-employment and price-stability goals. The increase in our balance sheet since March\n2020 has materially eased financial conditions and is providing substantial support to the\neconomy.\nPage 4 of 30\nJune 16, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nAt our meeting that concluded earlier today, the Committee had a discussion on the\nprogress made toward our goals since the Committee adopted its asset purchase guidance last\nDecember. While reaching the standard of “substantial further progress” is still a ways off,\nparticipants expect that progress will continue. In coming meetings, the Committee will\ncontinue to assess the economy’s progress toward our goals. As we have said, we will provide\nadvance notice before announcing any decision to make changes to our purchases.\nOn a final note, we made a technical adjustment today to the Federal Reserve’s\nadministered rates. The IOER and overnight RRP rates were adjusted upward by 5 basis points\nin order to keep the federal funds rate well within the target range and to support smooth\nfunctioning in money markets. This technical adjustment has no bearing on the appropriate path\nfor the federal funds rate or stance of monetary policy.\nTo conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses\nacross the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do\neverything we can to support the economy for as long as it takes to complete the recovery.\nThank you. I look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Rachel Siegel, the Washington Post.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Thank you, Michelle, and thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our\nquestions. I’m wondering if you can walk us through expectations you have, specifically when it\ncomes to the labor market going into 2023. And I’m curious about people who may have left the\nlabor market, who have yet to come back, or who may face issues with childcare. Perhaps\nthey’ve retired early. Any barriers that you see in keeping people from the labor market as you\nconsider full employment going into 2023? Thank you.\nPage 5 of 30\nJune 16, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. Thank you. So I would say, if you look at the labor market and you\nlook at the demand for workers and the level of job creation and think ahead, I think it’s clear,\nand I am confident, that we are on a path to a very strong labor market—a labor market that, that\nshows low unemployment, high participation, rising wages for people across the spectrum. I\nmean, I think that’s, that’s shown in our projections, it’s shown in outside projections. And if\nyou look through the current time frame and think one and two years out, we’re going to be\nlooking at a very, very strong labor market.\nIn terms of exactly what that means, we’ll, we’ll have to see how things evolve. I think\nwe learned during the course of the last very long expansion, the longest in our history, that labor\nsupply during a long expansion can exceed expectations, can move above its estimated trend.\nAnd, and I have no reason to think that that won’t happen again. At the same time, we have\nseen—in terms of participation, we’ve seen a significant number of, of people retire. And so we,\nwe don’t actually know exactly what labor force participation will be as we go forward, but I, I\nwould tend to, to look at it and think that it—that it can return to high levels, although it may\ntake some time to do that. But overall, this is—this is going to be, you know, a very strong labor\nmarket.\nIn terms of the near term, you ask as well—so we see a couple of things, a few things that\nseem likely to be holding back labor supply. There are very large amounts of job openings, and\nthere are a very large number of people who, who are unemployed. And the pace of, of filling\nthose jobs is—somehow feels slower than it might be. So I’d point to a number of things, the\nfirst of which is just that most of the, the act of sort of going back to one’s old job—that’s kind\nof already happened. So this is a question of people finding a new job. And that’s just a process\nthat takes longer. There may be something of a speed limit on it. You’ve got to find a job\nPage 6 of 30\nJune 16, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nwhere, where your skills match what, you know, what, what the employer wants. It’s got to be\nin the right area. There’s just a lot that goes into the function of finding a job. So that’s, that’s\nsort of a natural thing.\nIn addition, I would say that we, we look at, for example, a, a significant number of\npeople still say that they’re concerned about going back to work in jobs where there’s a lot of\npublic facing because of—because of COVID. So that’s clearly holding back some people, and\nthat should diminish as vaccinations move ahead.\nThere’s also the question of childcare. Many are engaged in, in caretaking. And as\nschools reopen and, and, and childcare/daycare centers open in the fall—in the fall, then we\nshould see—we should see that supporting labor force participation by caretakers.\nFinally, unemployment insurance for something like 15 million people will either end or\nbe diminished as we move through the summer and into, into, into the fall by the end of\nSeptember, and I’d like some—that may also encourage some to go back in and take jobs. So\nyou would think that that would add to an increase in job creation as well. So you put all those\ntogether, I would expect that we would see strong job creation building up over the summer and\ngoing into—going into the fall.\nI will also say, though, the last thing I’ll say is, this is an extraordinarily unusual time.\nAnd we, we really don’t have a template or, or, you know, any experience of, of a situation like\nthis. And so I think we have to be humble about our ability to understand the data. It’s not a\ntime to try to reach hard conclusions about the labor market, about inflation, about the path of\npolicy. We need to see more data. We need to be a little bit patient. And I do think, though, that\nwe’ll, we’ll, we’ll be seeing some things coming up in coming months that will—that will\ninform our, our thinking.\nPage 7 of 30\nJune 16, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Paul Kiernan.\nPAUL KIERNAN. Hi, Chairman Powell. Thanks for the question. Your—the\nCommittee’s median forecast on inflation seems to assume a pretty, pretty tame outlook for the\nrest of the year. As you know, the three-month annualized rate for the past three months was, I\nthink, 8.4 percent in the CPI. And I’m just wondering sort of how much longer we can sustain\nthose, those kinds of rates before you get nervous. Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. So inflation has come in above expectations over the last few\nmonths. But if you look behind the headline numbers, you’ll see that the incoming data are, are\nconsistent with the view that prices—that prices that are driving that higher inflation are from\ncategories that are being directly affected by the recovery from the pandemic and the reopening\nof the economy.\nSo, for example, the experience with, with lumber prices is, is illustrative of this. The\nthought is that prices like that that have moved up really quickly because of the shortages and\nbottlenecks and the like, they should stop going up, and at some point, they, they, in some cases,\nshould actually go down. And we did see that in the case of lumber.\nAnother example where we haven’t seen that yet is prices for used cars, which accounted\nfor more than a third of the total increase in core inflation. Used car prices are going up because\nof sort of a perfect storm of very strong demand and limited supply. It’s going up at just an\namazing annual rate. But we do think that it makes sense that that would stop, and that in fact it\nwould reverse over time. So we think we’ll be seeing some of that.\nWhen will we be seeing it? We’re not sure. That narrative seems, still seems quite likely\nto prove correct, although, you know, as I pointed out at the last press conference, the, the timing\nof that is, is pretty uncertain, and so are the, the effects in the near term. But over time, it seems\nPage 8 of 30\nJune 16, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nlikely that these very specific things that are driving up inflation will be—will be temporary.\nAnd we’ll be, you know, we’re going to be looking. We’ll be looking at the monthly pricing\ndata. I’ll, I’ll also say that the labor market is going to be important, both for the maximum-\nemployment goal, but also for inflation. And we’ll be looking at that. And, and as I—as I\nmentioned, we expect and I expect that we’ll see increases in supply over coming months as the\nfactors that we believe have been suppressing supply abate, wane, move down. So I, I can’t give\nyou an exact number or an exact time, but I would say that we do expect inflation to move down.\nIf you look at the—if you look at the forecast for 2021 and—sorry, 2022 and 2023 among my\ncolleagues on the, on the Federal Open Market Committee, you will see that people do expect\ninflation to move down meaningfully toward our goal. And I think the full range of, of, of\ninflation projections for 2023 falls between 2 and 2.3 percent, which is consistent with our—with\nour goals.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Now we’ll go to Ylan Mui at CNBC.\nYLAN MUI. Hi. Thank you, Chair Powell, for doing this. My question for you is that\nyou mentioned that your colleagues did have a discussion about the progress that you’re making\ntoward your, your goals in order to consider tapering your asset purchases. In that discussion,\nyou said that you didn’t—haven’t made substantial progress yet, but that you expect to continue\nto make progress. In that discussion, did you guys talk about a timeline for when you expect to\nsee that progress be made and when you might consider starting to reduce those purchases?\nCHAIR POWELL. Right. So I, I expect that we’ll be able to say more about timing as\nwe see more data. Basically, there’s not a lot of more light I can—I can shed on that. But you\ncan think of this meeting that we had as the “talking about talking about” meeting, if you like.\nAnd I now suggest that we retire that term, which has—which has served its purpose well, I\nPage 9 of 30\nJune 16, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthink. So Committee participants were of the view that since we adopted that guidance in\nDecember, the economy has clearly made progress, although we are still a ways from our goal of\nsubstantial further progress. Participants expect continued progress ahead toward that objective.\nAnd assuming that is the case, it will be appropriate to consider announcing a plan for reducing\nour asset purchases at a future meeting. So at coming meetings, the Committee will continue to\nassess the economy’s progress toward our goals, and we’ll give advance notice before\nannouncing any decision. The timing, of course, Ylan, will depend on the pace of that progress\nand not on any calendar.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Now we’ll go to Chris Rugaber, AP.\nCHRIS RUGABER. Right. Thank you. Well, you mentioned—let me ask about\ninflation expectations. You said they were—I think you mentioned in your opening statement\nthat you saw them as within target. Does that mean that some of the shorter-term measures\nwe’ve seen out there such as the New York Federal Reserve’s three-year outlook, which jumped\na bit—should those sort of be dismissed? And are we only looking at longer-term inflation\nexpectations? And would you describe those as still well anchored at this point? And on a\nrelated note, would the Fed consider publishing its index of common inflation expectations on a\nmonthly basis? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So we, we do tend to look at the longer-term inflation expectations,\nbecause that’s really, we think, what matters for, for inflation. So and, and, you know, the\nshorter-term ones do tend to move around based on, for example, gasoline prices. So you’ll see\nif gasoline prices were to spike, you’ll see the shorter-term inflation expectation measures,\nparticularly the surveys, move up. And, and that’s, that’s maybe not a good signal for future\ninflation if, if gas happens to spike and then go back down again.\nPage 10 of 30\nJune 16, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nSo we—yes, I think if, if you look at the broad range of longer-term inflation\nexpectations, they’ve moved up. They moved down during the beginning of the pandemic, you\nknow, sort of further exacerbating concerns that we might find ourselves where, for example, the\nECB and the Bank of Japan have been, where you have expectations and inflation itself sliding\ndown and you have a really hard time stopping that process once it begins. So that was a\nconcern. So it’s, it’s good, actually, to see inflation—longer-term inflation expectations move\nback up to a range—it’s a range that’s consistent with what our objectives are.\nThese are not precise measures, and that’s—and they, they contain risk premiums of\nvarious kinds. And that’s why we look at a broad range of them and tend to look at the\nmovement of that broad range of, of, of indicators, which are from, you know, surveys of\neconomists, surveys of the public, and also market based. It’s, it’s, it’s a wide index, as I’m sure\nyou know. We look at that, and we see them back in the range where they were. And, by the\nway, they’ve been broadly higher than that, somewhat modestly higher than that, not so many\nyears ago, at a time when inflation was, was, was still anchored at around 2 percent or maybe\neven a little bit below. So the answer is, yes, I think they are anchored and they’re at a good\nplace right now. It’s gratifying to see them having moved up off of their pandemic lows. And,\nyou know, as you know, it’s, it’s fundamental in our framework, our new framework, to, to\nassure that inflation—longer-term inflation expectations are anchored at a place that is consistent\nwith our goal. We, we think that’s an important reason. If, if inflation expectations are not\nanchored at a place that’s consistent with your goal, it’s not clear why you would expect to hit\nyour goal over the longer term. So it’s important.\nMICHELLE SMTH. Okay, now we’ll go to James Politi with the FT.\nPage 11 of 30\nJune 16, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nJAMES POLITI. Chair Powell—thanks, Chair Powell. Your economic projections\ntoday forecast 7 percent growth in 2022, unemployment at 4½ percent, and core inflation of\n3 percent. If those conditions are achieved by the end of the year, would that constitute\nsubstantial further progress, in your mind? And kind of more broadly, when you look at the sort\nof median forecast for interest rates in 2023 showing not one but two interest rate increases at the\ntime, I mean, is this kind of—can you describe the sort of tone of the—of the discussion in the\nCommittee? And are we really moving towards sort of a post-pandemic stance? Is there greater\nconfidence that, you know, the recovery will be, you know, a full recovery sooner than\nexpected?\nCHAIR POWELL. On your first question, the judgment of when we have arrived at\nsubstantial further progress is one that the Committee will make. And it would not be\nappropriate for me to lay out particular numbers that do or do not—that do or do not qualify.\nThat is—that is, you know, the process that we’re beginning now at the next meeting. We will\nbegin, meeting by meeting, to, to assess that progress and talk about what we—what we think\nwe’re seeing and, and just do all of the things that you do to sort of clarify your thinking around\nthe process of deciding whether and how to adjust the pace and composition of asset purchases.\nIn terms of the, the, the two hikes—so let me say a couple things first of all, not for the\nfirst time, about the—about the dot plot. These are, of course, individual projections. They’re\nnot a Committee forecast, they’re not a plan. And we did not actually have a discussion of\nwhether liftoff is appropriate at any particular year, because discussing liftoff now would be—\nwould be highly premature, wouldn’t make any sense. If you look at the transcripts from five\nyears ago, you’ll see that sometimes people mention their rate path in their interventions. Often\nthey don’t. And the last thing to say is, the dots are not a great forecaster of, of future rate\nPage 12 of 30\nJune 16, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nmoves. And that’s not because—it’s just because it’s so highly uncertain. There is no great\nforecaster of, of future dots. So, so dots to be taken with a—with a big, big grain of salt.\nHowever, so let me talk about this, this, this meeting. The Committee spelled out, as you\nknow, in our FOMC statements the conditions that it expects to see before an adjustment in the\ntarget range is made. And it’s outcome based, it’s not time based. And, as I mentioned, it’s\nlabor market conditions consistent with maximum employment, inflation at 2 percent and on\ntrack to exceed 2 percent. In the projections, it gives some sense of how participants see the\neconomy evolving in their most likely case. And, honestly, the main message I would take away\nfrom the SEP is that participants—many, many participants are more comfortable that the\neconomic conditions in the Committee’s forward guidance will be met somewhat sooner than\npreviously anticipated. And that would be a welcome development. If such outcomes\nmaterialize, it means the economy will have made faster progress toward our goals.\nSo the other thing I’ll say is, rate increases are really not at all the focus of the\nCommittee. The focus of the Committee is the current state of the economy. But in terms of our\ntools, it’s about asset purchases. That’s what we’re thinking about. Liftoff is, is well into the\nfuture. The conditions for liftoff—we’re very far from maximum employment, for example.\nIt’s, it’s a consideration for the future. So the near-term thing is really—the real near-term\ndiscussion, discussion that will begin is really about the, the path of asset purchases. And, as I\nmentioned, we had a discussion about that today and expect to, in future meetings, continue to\nthink about our progress.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We’ll go to Nancy Marshall-Genzer from\nMarketplace.\nPage 13 of 30\nJune 16, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nNANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Continuing—Chair Powell, continuing in that vein,\nwhen you’re ready, how will you go about signaling the start of tapering when you do decide to\ndo that?\nCHAIR POWELL. So our intention for this process is that it will be orderly, methodical,\nand transparent. And I can just tell you, we, we, we see real value in communicating well in\nadvance what our thinking is. And we’ll try to be clear. And, as I mentioned, we’ll, we’ll give\nadvance notice before announcing a decision to taper. And so all I can say is that we, we think\nit’s important—we think where the balance sheet’s concerned, a lot of notice, as much\ntransparency as we can give, and as far—as far in advance as we can to give people a chance to\nadjust their expectations. And, you know, we expect to be in that business until we reach\nsubstantial further progress and then have a—have a decision. Again, I have nothing further on\ntime. It wouldn’t be appropriate to say. We’re going to have to see more data. We’re a ways\naway from substantial further progress, we think. But we’re making progress.\nNANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. So you can’t say generally how far in advance you\nwould signal?\nCHAIR POWELL. Again, as we—as we approach that goal, we’ll provide, you know, as\nmuch clarity as we can.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Great, thank you. Going to Craig Torres at Bloomberg.\nCRAIG TORRES. Craig Torres at Bloomberg. If I were a businessman looking at the\nforecast today, I would ask how and when the Fed seeks to achieve an average of 2 percent\ninflation. In other words, does the FOMC have a look-back period? Or does it plan to suppress\ninflation in outer years because, over the next three years, you’re going to be above inflation? So\nwhat is your look-back period? Does the Committee have one? And if not, why not? And if\nPage 14 of 30\nJune 16, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthey don’t, why isn’t this just flexible inflation targeting without an average in a range of 2 to\n2¼ percent? Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, so as part of our year-and-a-half-long process, the review\nthat we did and came out with at the end of that with the—with the new Statement on Longer-\nRun Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, we looked carefully at the idea. We’ve all read all the\nliterature around different formulas for makeup and things like that. And we concluded—and,\nyou know, I strongly agree—that it’s not wise to, to wed yourself to a particular formulation of\nthat. So we did adopt a discretionary—there’s an element of discretion in it. You know, it says\nthat we will seek to—seek inflation that runs moderately above 2 percent for some time. And\nit’s, it’s meant to create a broad sense that we want inflation to average 2 percent over time. And\nthat under the old—under the old formula, under the old framework, what was happening was,\n2 percent was a ceiling because all of the errors were below. You were always getting back to\n2 percent. So you were bouncing back and forth between 1½ and 2, and we wanted them to be\ncentered around 2. So, so that’s, that’s the approach that we’re taking. And you’re right, it’s\nnot—it’s not a formulaic approach. We were clear on that when we announced the framework.\nWas there another part of your question, Craig?\nCRAIG TORRES. That pretty much answers it, Chair Powell. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Now we’ll go to Michael Derby.\nMICHAEL DERBY. Thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to ask you about the\nreverse repo usage that we’ve seen lately. I was curious if you are at all concerned about the\nlevel of money flowing into the reverse repo facility. And do you believe that the changes in the\nFed’s rate control toolkit today will have any impact on that? And then, in a related question, do\nPage 15 of 30\nJune 16, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nyou think that Fed asset purchases are taking too many safe assets out of the market right now\nand creating maybe some dislocations in the money markets?\nCHAIR POWELL. So on the—on the facility, we think it’s doing its job. We think it’s\ndoing—the reverse repo facility is, is doing what it’s supposed to do, which is to provide a floor\nunder money market rates and keep the federal funds rate well within its—well within its range.\nSo we’re not concerned with it. It’s doing—you have an unusual situation where the Treasury\nGeneral Account is, is shrinking and bill supply is shrinking. And so there’s, there’s downward\npressure—we’re buying assets—there’s downward pressure on short-term rates, and that facility\nis, is doing what we think it’s supposed to do. Sorry, your second question was again?\nMICHAEL DERBY. Yeah, I mean, the change in the rate control toolkit, will that have\nany impact on—do you think that will reduce the, the amount of money coming into reverse\nrepos? Will that have any impact on money market conditions that, you know, beyond the fed\nfunds rate setting?\nCHAIR POWELL. It could have some impact. I think we’ll have to see empirically.\nBut it’s designed to keep the federal funds rate, you know, within the range. And I do think it\ncould have some effect on, on broader money market conditions below as it relates to, you know,\nthe very low rates and the downward pressures.\nMICHAEL DERBY. And will it—do think it will lower uptake on the reverse repo\nfacility, or that’s just not even really a focus of what the change was?\nCHAIR POWELL. It’s not, honestly. And, you know, the funny thing, you would think\nthat it would, but we’ll have to see. It’s, it’s possible that that would not be the case. That’s\ngoing to be an empirical question.\nMICHAEL DERBY. Okay, cool. Thank you.\nPage 16 of 30\nJune 16, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMICHELLE SMITH. We’ll go to Jeanna Smialek, the New York Times.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Hey, Chair Powell. Thank you for taking our questions. I was\nwondering if you could follow up a little bit on your response to Rachel at the very beginning\nand talk a little bit about how we should understand what full employment means in a world that,\nas you mentioned, is pretty roiled. All the data is pretty—has been pretty roiled by the\npandemic, and we’re not really sure where EPOP is going to settle in, we’re not sure where\nparticipation is going to settle in. And wages are already looking, you know, decent. So I guess\nI wonder what full employment means in this context and, and sort of how you’re thinking about\nthose wage data.\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah. As, as you well know, there isn’t one indicator we can look\nto, and there’s no one number that we can therefore point to. We look at a range of indicators,\nand it’s a very broad range, you can count to a high number just quickly—but, but, certainly, it\nwill include things like unemployment and participation and wages and many different flavors of\nthat. So how do we think about it? A couple of things. We’re all going to be informed by what\nwe saw in the last cycle, which was labor supply outperforming expectations over a long period\nof time. Now, that hadn’t happened in many other cycles, but this was a very long cycle. So\nwe’re going to have to be alert to see whether that can happen again. It is a different—it’s a\ndifferent economy. We, we have had a slew of retirements, and that may weigh on participation.\nThat, that effect, though, should wear off in a few years and, and, you know, as you move\nthrough that window, because they would have—people would have retired anyway, and you’ll\nbe back where you, you would have been. So I think we’re—I think that lesson number one is, is\njust to be careful about assessing maximum employment. And I think if you—during the last\ncycle, there were—there were waves of concern that we were reaching full employment as early,\nPage 17 of 30\nJune 16, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nyou know, as, as 2012, when I arrived at the Fed. And, you know—you know, nine years later—\neight years later, we were still creating jobs. And, you know, it was quite remarkable. So we’re\nall going to be informed by that. At the same time, we understand this is a different economy.\nYou know, the, the demographics are, people are getting older, and that should have a secular\neffect of, of reducing participation over time. So we have to be sensible about what, what can be\ndone. But I think we’re going to be—we’re going to lean into that and be optimistic.\nYou asked about wages. You know, we’re seeing wage increases. That’s, that’s sort of a\nnatural thing to be seeing in a strong economy. And what we’re seeing is—we don’t see\nanything that’s troubling in the sense of—what would be troubling would be, you know, very\nwide across the economy, wages at unsustainable levels without high inflation. In other words,\nwages in excess of productivity and inflation, you know, by a meaningful amount broadly across\nthe economy, sort of forcing companies to keep raising prices and getting into a wage–price\ncycle. That’s, that’s the old formula for—one of the old formulas for having high inflation. We\ndon’t see anything like that now. We do see high wages. We see them for, for people who are\nmostly new, you know, entering into new jobs, many of them in low-skilled jobs. And, but we,\nwe do think—you’ve got to—you’ve got to think in the labor market right now, where, where\nsupply and demand are just not matched up well. And, you know, we think it’s a flexible\neconomy and, and it will clear. There will—there will be a level at which supply and demand\nmeet. And that’ll—we think that’ll, that’ll be happening in coming months.\nSo—but the last thing I’ll say is, again, if you look at, at the forecasts, we are going to be\nin a very strong labor market pretty quickly here. There are still a big group of unemployed\npeople. And, you know, we’re not going to forget about them. We’re going—we’re going to do\neverything we can to get people back into work and give them the chance to work. But there’s\nPage 18 of 30\nJune 16, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nevery reason to think that we’ll be in a—in a labor market with very attractive numbers, with low\nunemployment, high participation, and rising wages across the spectrum. So that’s, that’s a little\nbit how we’re looking at the—at the labor market.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Now we’ll go to Hannah Lang at the American\nBanker.\nHANNAH LANG. Hi, I wanted to ask about the status of your thinking around the\nsupplementary leverage ratio right now. Is the Fed still thinking about ways to permanently\nadjust this to account for the high growth in deposits? And do you ultimately believe a\npermanent fix is needed? And any information on the timing around that would be—would be\nhelpful.\nCHAIR POWELL. What I can say is, we’re working on it. I don’t have anything to\nshare with you in terms of the particulars or the timing right now, unfortunately. But we’ve,\nwe’ve always—our position has been for a long time and, and it is now that we’d, we’d like the\nleverage ratio to be a backstop to risk-based capital requirements. When leverage requirements\nare, are, are binding, it does skew incentives for firms to substitute lower-risk assets for high-risk\nones. It’s a straightforward thing. And because of the substantial increase in reserves,\nTreasuries, and other safe assets in the banking system, the SLR is rapidly ceasing to become—\nceasing to be the intended backstop for big firms that we want it to be. So we do think it’s\nappropriate to consider ways to adapt it to this new high-reserves environment, and, and we’re\nlooking hard at the issue. We would also, just to be really clear, we will take whatever actions\nare necessary to assure that any changes we do make or recommend do not erode the overall\nstrength of bank capital requirements. Sorry, I can’t give you any more. That’s just something\nwe’re working on.\nPage 19 of 30\nJune 16, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Now we’ll go to Anneken Tappe at CNN Business.\nANNEKEN TAPPE. Hi there. Thanks for taking my question. Chairman Powell, the\nprice jumps we’ve seen in some raw materials—lumber, for example, you mentioned that\nearlier—seem to be easing. And it looks like we’re at the beginning of suppliers catching up\nwith demand. But I wonder if you’re worried at all, if we’re going to end up with excess supply\nimmediately after those shortages wear off and if we just continue this mismatch, as we’re\nrecovering and getting out of the pandemic economy. And I wonder how that would affect the\nFed’s outlook at all.\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, that is really not the problem we’re having right now. But—\nand, actually, people who work in commodity industries are very focused on that, because they\nknow that, you know, they don’t want to build, build capacity and then find out that it’s not\nnecessary. So, really, the problem now is, is that demand is very, very strong. Incomes are high,\npeople have money in their bank accounts. Demand for goods is extremely high, and it hasn’t—\nit hasn’t come down. We’re seeing the service sector reopening. And so you’re seeing prices\nare moving back up off their lows there.\nBut in terms of, of overcorrecting, I mean, I think there, there is a possibility on the other\nside of this that, that inflation could be—could actually be quite low going forward. But that’s\nnot—that’s not really where our focus is right now. Our focus right now is, we need to—our,\nour expectation is that these, these high inflation readings that we’re seeing now will start to\nabate. And that’s, that’s what we think. And it’ll be like the lumber experience, and like we\nexpect the used car experience to be. With things like airplane tickets and hotels, which are the\nother two factors in the most recent CPI report that went up a lot, we expect that those prices will\nget back up to where they were, but there’s no reason to think that they’re going to keep going up\nPage 20 of 30\nJune 16, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\na lot. Because if they are, people will build new hotels. There’s no reason for supply and\ndemand to be out of whack in the hotel business over any period of time. So we think that’ll\nhappen.\nI think in terms of the timing and the effects on inflation in the near term, there’s a lot of\nuncertainty. The overall story is one that, that we think is right, and we think the incoming data\nsupport it and, you know, so do many, many forecasters. And if you look at the forecasts on the\nFOMC, you will—you will see that as well. But we don’t—we don’t in any way dismiss the\nchance that it can work out that, that this goes on longer than expected. And the risk would be\nthat over time, it does begin to affect inflation expectations. And if we see inflation expectations\nand inflation—or inflation moving up in a way that is really materially above what we—what we\nwould see as consistent with our goals, and persistently so, we wouldn’t hesitate to use our tools\nto address that. Price stability is half of our mandate, and we would certainly do that. We do not\nexpect that, though. That is not our base case.\nAnd, and in that we’re joined by many other forecasters, but there’s a lot to be humble\nabout among forecasters. Forecasters have a lot to be humble about. It’s a—it’s a highly\nuncertain business. And we’re, we’re very much attuned to the risks and, and watching the data\ncarefully. In the meantime, I would say, you know, we should—as I mentioned earlier, there’s\nso much uncertainty around this. It’s, it’s just a unique situation that we need to see how things\nevolve in coming months and, and see how that story holds up and act accordingly.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We’ll go to Howard Schneider at Reuters.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Howard Schneider, Reuters. Thanks, Chair Powell, for taking\nthis. I don’t want to miss the moment here. And I just—I noticed that in the statement you\ndropped the language saying that the pandemic is weighing on the economy. So is this the\nPage 21 of 30\nJune 16, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\neffective end, in your view, of the pandemic as a constraint on economic activity, even though\nit’s still cited as a risk?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, it’s a—it’s a continuum, right? What you’ve seen with\nthe pandemic is sharply declining cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. And that’s great. And,\nand, you know, that should continue. But, you know, you, you also saw in the United Kingdom,\nwhich has, I think, at least as high if not higher vaccination rates, they’ve had an outbreak of the\nDelta variety. And it’s—and it’s causing them to have to—to have to react to that. So you’re\nnot—you’re not out of the woods at this point. And it would be premature to—in my thinking, it\nwould be premature to declare victory. Vaccination still has a ways to go to get to levels—it\nwould be good to see it get to a substantially higher level. And, you know, that can only help.\nSo, look, I—but you’re right, the statement language is evolving. I would expect it to\ncontinue to evolve. There’s a lot of judgment in that. But you can expect us to drag our feet a\nlittle bit on that, because that’s what you do with statement language. It’s, it’s great to see the\nprogress. But, again, I would not declare victory yet. I would say it is so great to see the\nreopening of the economy, though, and to see people out living their lives again. You know,\nwho doesn’t want to see that? And it appears to be safe, and I just would encourage people to\ncontinue to get vaccinated.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. If I could follow up on that, if you—if you view this\nstatement in, in toto and the—and the dots and the substance as well, do you think this is more a\nmark-to-market exercise around the improvement in health or around the inflation risks you see\ndeveloping out there?\nCHAIR POWELL. I think it’s both. You know, I think, clearly, since March what’s\nhappened is, people have grown more confident in these very strong outcomes, that they’ll be\nPage 22 of 30\nJune 16, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nachieved. Very strong outcomes in the economy will be achieved. There’s, there’s more\ngrounds for comfort. We’ve seen growth coming higher than we expected. We’ve seen very\nstrong labor demand. We’ve also seen—we have seen inflation above target, though, and I think\neven though, you know, in, in our forecasters’ case, they do see inflation coming back down over\n’22 and ’23 into, into areas that are very consistent with our—with our mandate. Nonetheless,\nthe risk is, is something that can factor into people’s thinking about appropriate monetary policy.\nThe thing is, you know, these are 18 different forecasts, and I can’t stand here and say exactly\nwhat was in all 18 people’s minds. But that, that is something that I think can factor into things\nas well—factor into our forecast as well.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We’ll go to Victoria Guida with Politico.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Chair Powell. I, I wanted to ask a little bit more about inflation\nto make sure I understand how you’re thinking about this. So in the projections, inflation is\nexpected to, to be high this year and then come back down next year and then maybe start to rise\na little bit again, enough for a liftoff in 2023. You know, I know that’s obviously—you know,\ntake that with a grain of salt. But that would suggest that you all could theoretically see inflation\nsustainably staying above 2 percent. And so, I guess my question is, what would be causing that\ninflation? What, what would be—because it seems like you all now see a situation in which\ninflation would be rising in a way that isn’t caused by transitory factors in the—in the next\ncouple of years. So would that be the result of a tight labor market? Would that be because this\nwhole situation has raised people’s inflation expectations? How are you thinking about that?\nCHAIR POWELL. So what we’re seeing in the near term—again, our base case is that\nwhat we’re seeing in the near term is, is principally associated with, with the reopening of the\nPage 23 of 30\nJune 16, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\neconomy and not with a tight labor market or tight resource constraints, really. So—but you’re\nright. When, when you get to—in, in the forecast, all of that, you know, supply and demand\nsides of the economy adapt. We have a very highly adaptive, you know, flexible economy, more\nso than most. And by 2023, those increases are really about, about, you know, rising resource\nutilization or, to put it a different way, you know, low unemployment, or high employment is a\nway to think about it. So that’s what that’s about. That’s about the kind of broad inflationary\npressure that results from, you know, a really strong expansion tightening up resource utilization\nacross the whole economy and lifting, lifting up inflation. And that’s why—that’s why you\nwould see it then, because by then, you know, in the forecast—and it’s just a forecast, they’re\njust individual forecasts. In people’s forecasts, that’s what’s happening.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. So the, the, the change in the projections reflect the fact that you\nall are more optimistic about the economic outlook, and not necessarily that you think that this\nwill change the way people think about inflation?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah, I think—there may be an element of the latter as well, because\ninflation expectations have continued to move up. You know, it’s all in people’s individual\nthinking, and you can’t—it’s hard to say. It’s not something the Committee debates in terms of,\nyou know, what, what the outlook is for 2023. So I’m, I’m a little bit speculating, which I\nshouldn’t do. But it wouldn’t surprise me if there’s an element for some people in, you know,\nseeing the inflation performance that we’ve had and thinking that I have more confidence that we\ncould see inflation above 2 percent, that it may not be as hard to do that as we thought, and that\ninflation expectations may move up to a—to a level—they were—they were really at a level that\nwas kind of a little below 2 percent. They might move up as a consequence of this or, or, or as a\nconsequence of, of, of the new framework. You know, we did see inflation expectations moving\nPage 24 of 30\nJune 16, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nup in the—in the wake of the announcement of the framework. But, you know, we don’t really\nknow that. So, ultimately, I think it’s consistent with both those things.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Now we’ll go to Greg Robb at MarketWatch.\nGREG ROBB. Hi. Hi, thank you for taking my question. Chair Powell, I’m just looking\nat the forecast, and one thing I just don’t think has been talked about all that much is how much\nyou guys—the Fed thinks that the economy is going to slow next year. I mean, are we looking at\na scenario of a slowing economy next year with higher inflation? And, and what do you think\nabout that?\nCHAIR POWELL. We’re looking at an economy that will not have the degree of, of\nfiscal support. The fiscal support in the forecast is much less than it was this year. So—but\nyou’ve, you’ve still got a very strong growth, well above the longer-run potential output of the—\nof the economy. You’ve got—you’ve got growth meaningfully above that, and inflation is lower\nnext year in all of our—in all of our forecasts. I think the range of, of core PCE forecast for next\nyear is 1.7 to 2.5 in 2022 and, and 2 to 2.3 in 2023. So you’re right, you’re seeing—I, I can’t\nremember the number, but it might be in the 3s—3, 3½ percent growth for next year. That’s,\nthat’s a really good year—coming on the back of a 7 percent growth year, that’s a really good\nyear. That’s, that’s a year with a lot of momentum. That’ll see—you know, that’ll cause\nsignificant job creation and, and it will—I mean, we would take 3½ percent. We didn’t have a\n3½ percent growth year—we didn’t have a 3 percent growth year between the Global Financial\nCrisis and the end of the expansion. So that would be a good year.\nGREGG ROBB. Doesn’t it seem like there’s a risk of, of, you know, like stagflation—\nwhere that—you’re going to go from 7 percent and down, that means the economy’s really, you\nknow, dropping in some way. We haven’t seen that, right?\nPage 25 of 30\nJune 16, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, the economy’s not, not decel—the economy is still growing,\nand growing at a, at a very healthy rate. Our estimate—I mean, different people have different\nestimates—but, broadly speaking, economists think the economy has the potential to grow at\naround 2 percent per year. If you’re growing above that, then the unemployment rate should be\ndeclining, people should be being pulled into the labor force, wages should be going up, lots of\nthings should be happening, businesses should be investing.\nSo, you know, I guess to answer your question a different way, is there a risk that\ninflation will be higher than we think? Yes. As I said earlier, you know, we, we don’t have any\ncertainty about the timing or the extent of these effects from reopening. And therefore we\ndon’t—we don’t think that—we think it’s unlikely that they would materially affect the\nunderlying inflation dynamics that the economy has had for a quarter of a century. The\nunderlying forces around the globe that have created those dynamics are intact, and those are\naging population, low productivity, globalization, all of those things that, that we think have,\nhave, you know, really held down inflation. All that’s out there still. You know, when we get\nthrough this, we may well—we’ll be facing those same forces. Nonetheless, is there a risk that\ninflation will remain higher than we—than we thought? Yes. And if, if we see inflation moving\nabove our goals in, in a time—sorry, to an extent, to a level or, or persistently—or persistently\nenough, you know, we would be prepared to use our tools to address that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Going to Brian Cheung with Yahoo.\nBRIAN CHEUNG. Chair Powell, Brian Cheung, Yahoo Finance. On that point, you\ntalked about maybe some of the more structural changes in that last answer with regards to\nproductivity. I noted that the median projection for r*, the longer-term interest rate, is still the\nsame at 2.5 percent. But there’s been some literature out there that maybe the COVID crisis\nPage 26 of 30\nJune 16, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ncould have actually changed some of the underlying fundamentals of the economy and maybe\nchanged productivity, in addition to combined with demographic changes that have already been\nin effect to suggest that that longer-term neutral rate or r* might be higher. What would the\nimplications of that be for monetary policy? Do you think that maybe the Fed could have the\npossibility of underestimating the long-run neutral rate? And what might be the impact of that?\nCHAIR POWELL. A higher neutral rate would mean that interest rates would run higher\nby that amount. And, and that would be a good thing from the standpoint of the economy,\nbecause it would give the Fed more room to cut rates. The problem with, with interest rates\nbeing close to the lower bound, of course, is that it really cuts into our ability to react to a\ndownturn—for example, a pandemic. And if you look, for example, at the European Central\nBank, their, their policy rate was well below zero when, when the pandemic hit. So we don’t\nwant to be in a place where we can’t react. A higher neutral rate would, would be—from that\nnarrow standpoint, would be a good thing for us. It would give us more room and, therefore,\nthen, that would tend to result in better outcomes for the economy over time. You know, we,\nit’s—you can’t estimate it with great—with great precision. I think we would be alert to—I\nmean, studying r* is a—is a whole industry unto itself. And I, I think we would be alert to\nfactors that might raise r*, the neutral rate of interest. And, you know, we, we try to keep up\nwith that. And I think we’re, we’re, we’re all thinking about that and the possibility of that. You\nknow, there are many—there are a lot of stories right now that could—that essentially could lead\nto higher productivity growth and higher r*. We don’t know which of those stories will come\ntrue. But, I mean, I’ll give you an example. It’s just there are—there are a lot of start-ups, a lot\nof early-stage companies. And is that going to have that effect? We don’t know. But we’ll be\nwatching those things carefully.\nPage 27 of 30\nJune 16, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMICHELLE SMITH. Great, thank you. For the last question, we’ll go to Michael\nMcKee at Bloomberg TV.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Mr. Chairman, of course you’ll be shocked to learn that you have\nsome critics on Wall Street. And I would like to paraphrase a couple of their criticisms and get\nyour reaction to them. One is that the new policy framework is that you react to actual data and\ndo not react to forecasts, yet the actual inflation data is coming in hot and you’re relying on the\nforecast that it will cool down in order to make policy. I wanted to get your view on how you\nsquare that. Another is that you have a long runway, you’ve said, for tapering with\nannouncements. But if the data keep coming in faster than expected, are you trapped by fear of a\ntaper tantrum from advancing the time period in which you announce a taper? And, finally,\nyou’ve said the Fed knows how to combat inflation, but raising rates also slows the economy.\nAnd there’s a concern that you might be sacrificing the economy if you wait too long and have to\nraise rates too quickly.\nCHAIR POWELL. So that’s a—that’s a few questions there. So let me say, first, I think\npeople misinterpret the framework. I think the—there’s nothing wrong with the framework, and\nthere’s nothing in the framework that would in any way, you know, interfere with our ability to\npursue our, our goals. That’s for starters. All of our discussions and all of our thinking and\nplanning are taking place in the context of our new framework. We’re strongly committed to it,\nwe think it’s well suited to our goals, including in this—in this unique time. And I think if you\nlook at the—look at the forecasts that we’ve written down, you know, our Committee is solidly\nbehind them. The forecasts are all consistent with that.\nYou know, your specific question, I guess, was, will we be behind the curve? And, you\nknow, that’s, that’s not the situation we’re facing at all. The situation that we, we addressed in\nPage 28 of 30\nJune 16, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nour—in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy was a situation in\nwhich employment was at very high levels, but inflation was low. And what we said was, we\nwouldn’t raise interest rates just because unemployment was low and employment was high if\nthere was no evidence of inflation or other troubling imbalances. So that’s what we said.\nThat is not at all the current situation. In the current situation, we have many millions of\npeople who are unemployed, and we have inflation running well above our target. The question\nwe face with this inflation has nothing to do with our framework. It’s a very different, very\ndifficult version of a standard investment—sorry, a central banking question. And that is, how\ndo you separate in inflation—how do you separate things that, that follow from broad upward\nprice pressures from things that really are a function of, of sort of idiosyncratic factors in a\nparticular—due to particular things? I mean, a classic example was, to pick a narrow example,\nwas the cellphone price war back in 2017. If you remember, there was—prices were incredibly\nlow, and it held down core PCE by three-tenths or something for a year, and then it fell out. So\nthis is much bigger than that. And, of course, it’s not—it’s not easy to tell in real time which is\nwhich, but that’s, that’s the question you would face under, really, any framework. And, you\nknow, we’re trying to sort that out. I’ve tried to, to explain that today about how we think about\nthat. And, you know, we do think that these are temporary factors, and that they’ll wane. We\ncan’t be absolutely certain about the timing of that, and we’re prepared to use our tools as\nappropriate.\nYour second one was? Oh, you know, we will—we will taper when we feel that the\neconomy has achieved substantial further progress. And we will communicate very carefully in\nadvance on that. And that’s what we’re doing. That’s what we’re going to do, and, and we will\nfollow through on that. There’s no—I mean, we will do what we can to avoid a market reaction.\nPage 29 of 30\nJune 16, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nBut, ultimately, when we achieve our macroeconomic goal, we will—we will taper as\nappropriate.\nThe third thing was—what was the third thing?\nMICHAEL MCKEE. If you raise rates to control inflation, you also slow the economy.\nAnd the history of the Fed is that sometimes you go too far.\nCHAIR POWELL. That’s right. And we—look, we have to balance the two—the two\ngoals: maximum employment and price stability. Often they are—they do pull in the same\ndirection, of course. But when we—when we raise interest rates to control inflation, there’s no\nquestion that has an effect on activity. And that’s the channel—one of the channels through\nwhich we get to inflation. We don’t think that we’re in a situation like that right now. We think\nthat the economy is recovering from a deep hole—an unusual hole, actually, because it’s to do\nwith, with shutting down the economy. It turns out it’s a heck of a lot easier to create demand\nthan it is to, you know, to bring supply back up to snuff. That’s happening all over the world.\nThere’s no reason to think that that process will last indefinitely. But we’re going, you know,\nwe’re going to watch carefully to make sure that, that evolving inflation and our understanding\nof what’s happening is, is, is right. And in the meantime, we’ll conduct policy appropriately.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Chair.\nPage 30 of 30"

    "press_conf": "July 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nTranscript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference\nJuly 28, 2021\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed\nto achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and\nprice stability.\nToday the Federal Open Market Committee kept interest rates near zero and maintained\nour asset purchases. These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and on our\nbalance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to support the economy until the\nrecovery is complete.\nProgress in vaccinations and unprecedented fiscal policy actions are also providing strong\nsupport to the recovery. Indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to\nstrengthen, and real GDP this year appears to be on track to post its fastest rate of increase in\ndecades. Much of this rapid growth reflects the continued bounceback in activity from depressed\nlevels.\nThe sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic have shown improvement but have\nnot fully recovered. Household spending is rising at an especially rapid pace, boosted by the\nongoing reopening of the economy and ongoing policy support. The housing sector remains\nvery strong, and business investment is increasing at a solid pace. In some industries, near-term\nsupply constraints are restraining activity. These constraints are particularly acute in the motor\nvehicle industry, where worldwide shortages of semiconductors have sharply curtailed\nproduction so far this year.\nAs with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have continued to\nimprove. Demand for labor is very strong, and employment rose 850,000 in June, with the\nPage 1 of 29\nJuly 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nleisure and hospitality sector continuing to post notable gains. Nonetheless, the labor market has\na ways to go.\nThe unemployment rate in June—in June was 5.9 percent, and this figure understates the\nshortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from\nthe low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year. Factors related to the pandemic, such\nas caregiving needs, ongoing fears of the virus, and unemployment insurance payments, appear\nto be weighing on employment growth. These factors should wane in coming months, leading to\nstrong gains in employment.\nThe economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to\nshoulder the burden have been hardest hit. In particular, despite progress, joblessness continues\nto fall disproportionately on lower-wage workers in the service sector and on African Americans\nand Hispanics.\nInflation has increased notably and will likely remain elevated in coming months before\nmoderating. As the economy continues to reopen and spending rebounds, we are seeing upward\npressure on prices, particularly because supply bottlenecks in some sectors have limited how\nquickly production can respond in the near term. These bottleneck effects have been larger than\nanticipated, but as these transitory supply effects abate, inflation is expected to drop back toward\nour longer-run goal. Very low readings from early in the pandemic as well as the pass-through\nof past increases in oil prices to consumer energy prices also contribute to the increase, although\nthese base effects and energy effects are receding.\nThe process of reopening the economy is unprecedented, as was the shutdown at the\nonset of the pandemic. As the reopening continues, bottlenecks, hiring difficulties, and other\nconstraints could continue to limit how quickly supply can adjust, raising the possibility that\nPage 2 of 29\nJuly 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ninflation could turn out to be higher and more persistent than we expect. Our new framework for\nmonetary policy emphasizes the importance of having well-anchored inflation expectations, both\nto, to foster price stability and to enhance our ability to promote our broad-based and inclusive\nmaximum-employment goal.\nIndicators of long-term inflation expectations appear broadly consistent with our longer-\nrun inflation goal of 2 percent. If we saw signs that the path of inflation or longer-term inflation\nexpectations were moving materially and persistently beyond levels consistent with our goal,\nwe’d be prepared to adjust the stance of policy.\nThe effects of the pandemic on the economy have continued to diminish, but risks to the\neconomic outlook remain. Progress on vaccinations has limited the spread of COVID-19.\nHowever, the pace of vaccinations has slowed, and the Delta strain of the virus is spreading\nquickly in some areas. Continued progress on vaccinations would support a return to more\nnormal economic conditions.\nThe Fed’s policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to\npromote the stability of the financial system. As the Committee reiterated in today’s policy\nstatement, with inflation having run persistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve inflation\nmoderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and\nlonger-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. We expect to maintain an\naccommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes are\nachieved.\nWith regard to interest rates, we continue to expect that it will be appropriate to maintain\nthe current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions\nPage 3 of 29\nJuly 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nhave reached level—levels consistent with the Committee’s assessment of maximum\nemployment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent\nfor some time.\nIn addition, we are continuing to—continuing to increase our holdings of Treasury\nsecurities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency MBS by at least $40 billion per month\nuntil substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum-employment and price-\nstability goals. Our asset purchases have been a critical tool. They helped preserve financial\nstability and market functioning early in the pandemic and since then have helped foster\naccommodative financial conditions to support the economy.\nAt our meeting that concluded earlier today, the Committee continued to discuss the\nprogress made toward our—toward our goals since the Committee adopted its asset purchase\nguidance last December. We also reviewed some considerations around how our asset purchases\nmight be adjusted, including their pace and composition, once economic conditions warrant a\nchange. Participants expect that the economy will continue to move toward our standard of\n“substantial further progress.” In coming meetings, the Committee will again assess the\neconomy’s progress toward our goals, and the timing of any change in the pace of our asset\npurchases will depend on the incoming data. As we’ve said, we will provide advance notice\nbefore making any changes to our purchases.\nOn a final note, we announced the establishment of two standing repo facilities, a\ndomestic one for primary dealers and additional banks and another for foreign and international\nmonetary authorities. These facilities will serve as backstops in money markets to support the\neffective implementation of monetary policy and smooth market functioning.\nPage 4 of 29\nJuly 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nTo conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses\nacross the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do\neverything we can to support the economy for as long as it takes to complete the recovery.\nThank you. I look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let’s go to Steve Liesman with CNBC.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Thank you very much. Mr. Chairman, I wonder if you might be\nable to put some, I don’t know, numbers or maybe more detail around this concept of\n“substantial further progress.” What counts as the progress numerically, if you will, or, or, or\nciting data, if you could, that you cited in the statement today? And if you could be more\nspecific about what substantial further progress would look like and if that would then lead you\nto an announcement of an actual reduction in the purchases of your assets. Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Great. Thank you. So more detail on substantial further progress.\nSo let’s talk about the maximum-employment part of that. As you know, with maximum\nemployment—unlike with, with price stability, where we can target a number of 2 percent on\naverage—with maximum employment, there isn’t a single number that we can target. That the—\nwe monitor a broad range of, of, of data about different aspects of the labor market. There’s\nunemployment, unemployment among different, different age groups, and such. There’s\nparticipation. There’s wages. There’s all kinds of flow data. And we look at all of it to try to\narrive at a picture of what—of what is maximum employment.\nSo there isn’t—I can’t give you a, a, a set of numbers—for example, a numerical\nthreshold like we used for a time back in 2012, I guess it was. We didn’t do that here. What we\nsaid was substantial further progress toward our goals. And what we said was, we would keep,\nPage 5 of 29\nJuly 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\neffectively, we’d—we would give advance warning as we—and, and, you know, more and more\nclarity—as, as we move forward. And that’s what we’re going to try to do.\nSo what would substantial further progress be? I’d say we have some ground to cover\non, on the labor market side. I think we’re, we’re some way away from, from having had\nsubstantial further progress with, with max—toward the maximum-employment goal. I would\nwant to see some strong job numbers. And, and that’s, that’s kind of the idea.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. If, if I could follow up, you talked about one side of the equation.\nYou didn’t—does it mean you feel like you’ve reached your goal when it comes to the inflation\nside? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So inflation is running well above our 2 percent objective and has\nbeen for a few months and is expected to run up certainly above our objective for a few months\nbefore we believe it’ll, it’ll move back down toward our objective. The question whether we’ve\nmet that objective formally is really one for the Committee to make. I can’t—I can’t do that by\nmyself. But it’s clear that, at this time, inflation is actually running above 2 percent. And, and,\nagain, has been and will be, at least we expect it will, in coming months before returning down\ntoward our target.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Ann Saphir with Reuters.\nANN SAPHIR. Hello. Can you hear me? [No response] Hello. Can you hear me? I’m\nsorry.\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes, yes. We can hear you.\nANN SAPHIR. I apologize. I—just to follow up on the question, I want to ask, you\nknow, is it—is it correct to see this as the, the start of the advance notice process, you know,\nPage 6 of 29\nJuly 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nbefore a taper? And, and, and also, can you speak to how the recent surge in COVID factors into\nyour thinking on, on the taper? Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. So, as you know, we’re, we’re in a process now where what we said\nis that as—at this meeting and in coming meetings, we’re going to be continuing to assess the\neconomy’s progress toward our goals and give advance notice. We’ll be—try to provide\nadditional clarity about our thinking, both in the—in the postmeeting statement and in the\nminutes and in the public comments that people make.\nYou know, our, our approach here has been to be as transparent as we can. We have not\nreached substantial further progress yet. So we’re, we’re not there, and we see our ways as\nhaving some—we see ourselves as having some ground to cover to get there. So that’s what I\nwould say.\nIn terms of—in terms of, of COVID and the Delta strain, I’ll say a couple things. Of\ncourse, it will have significant health consequences for many. And we need to keep that in mind\nbefore we start—before we mention and move to the economic questions. This is a—rising\ncases in, in a number of parts of the country, and some forecasts are for them to rise quite\nsignificantly. We’ll see.\nWhat we’ve seen, though, is with successive waves of, of COVID over the past year and\nsome months now, there has tended to be less economic—less in the way of economic\nimplications from each wave. And we will see whether that is the case with the Delta variety.\nBut it’s, you know, it’s a—it’s certainly a—not an unreasonable expectation.\nSo it, it certainly is plausible if people would pull back from some activities because of\nthe risk of infection. Dining out, traveling, schools might—some schools might not reopen. We\nmay just—we may see economic effects from some of that, or it might weigh on, on the return to\nPage 7 of 29\nJuly 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthe labor market. Some people might choose—again, we, we don’t have a strong sense of how\nthat might work out, so we’ll just be monitoring it—monitoring it carefully.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We’ll go to Nick Timiraos at the Wall Street Journal.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Hi, Chair Powell. Nick Timiraos at the Wall Street Journal. In your\nopening statements in March and April, you noted that a transitory rise in inflation above\n2 percent this year would not meet the threshold of moderately exceeding 2 percent for some\ntime, and I noticed you didn’t repeat that qualification last month or today. And, and so, in your\nview, has the rise in inflation this year met the threshold of moderately exceeding 2 percent for\nsome time?\nCHAIR POWELL. That, that would, again, be a question for the Committee. But I\nwould really say, the guidance that you’re talking about is really the guidance to do with liftoff,\nright? That’s—what the guidance is for liftoff, we had to have labor market conditions\nconsistent with full employment, inflation at 2 percent and on track to run—to run moderately\nabove 2 percent for some time. It really isn’t relevant now. It—because we’re really—we’re\nlooking at, at tapering asset purchases.\nWe’re clearly a ways away from considering raising interest rates. It’s not something\nthat, that is on our radar screen right now. You know, so when we get to that question, when we\nstart to get to the question of, of liftoff, which, which we are not at all at now or near now, that’s\nwhen we’ll ask that question. That is when that, that will become a real question for us.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Jeanna Smialek at the New York Times.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you for taking our questions. I wonder\nif you could talk a little bit about [inaudible] reacting [inaudible]. You know, does that affect,\nPage 8 of 29\nJuly 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\naffect how you’re thinking about tapering? Does it affect how you’re thinking about, you know,\npotential liftoff down the road? And if you could, just talk a little bit about that.\nCHAIR POWELL. Jeanna, I’m sorry. For the first 15 seconds of your question, you\nfroze. Could you—could you say that again? I apologize.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Oh, yes. No. Sorry. Yes. So I was wondering if you could talk a\nlittle bit about how the divergence in global growth and the sort of multispeed recovery we’re\nseeing around the world impacts how the Fed thinks about its policies. So do you take into\naccount that sort of multispeed recovery when you’re thinking about tapering QE, and do you\ntake, take it into account when you’re thinking about liftoff?\nCHAIR POWELL. Thanks. So it’s an—it’s an important feature of this recovery is how\nuneven it is. And, in many cases, that’s related to the fact that some countries have had little in\nthe way of access to, to vaccines. And so they’re seeing significant outbreaks, and it’s weighing\non economic activity, whereas other countries—such as the United States, in particular—are\nhaving a very strong rebound. And, and now Europe is having a stronger rebound as well.\nSo it’s a feature of our economy. Now, how does it affect our policy? In, in a couple of\nways, potentially. One just is that, in general, economies—and through financial markets and\nthrough trade—are, are deeply interconnected now. And so a stronger global economy will lead\nto more U.S. exports. And, and, you know, that’ll help economic activity. To the extent the\nglobal economy is weak and the United States is strong, it’ll—we’ll wind up, you know, we’ll\nwind up exporting some of our demand through, through imports rather than having, having a lot\nof exports. That’s one way.\nAnother way, though, is more on the risk side. And that is, as long as COVID is running\nloose out there, as long as there’s time and space for the development of new strains, no one’s\nPage 9 of 29\nJuly 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nreally finally safe. These, these strains—there’s no reason they just can’t keep coming and one,\nyou know, one more powerful than the next. We don’t know that. But that’s, that’s, that’s\ncertainly a plausible outcome. Now, as, as vaccinations rise, we can nonetheless get back to our\neconomic activity. But, you know, it, it is both the right thing to do and, and very much in our\ninterest to make sure that vaccination happens broadly around the world, just for that reason.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. James at the FT.\nJAMES POLITI. Thank you very much. Chair Powell, how would you describe the\nrisks to the outlook on inflation at the moment after the last data came out higher than expected?\nDo you believe the risks are, you know, tilted to the upside? And does the Committee share that\nview? Or are they in balance? Are you still worried that there could be a hit to demand from,\nfrom the Delta variant that could tilt them sort of to the downside again? If you could give us a\nsense of that, that would be very helpful.\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. I’d be glad to. So if you look, again, if you look at the, the\nmost recent inflation report, what you see is that it came in significantly higher than expected.\nBut essentially all of the overshoot can be tied to a handful of categories. It isn’t the kind of\ninflation that’s spread broadly across the economy. It’s new, used, and rental cars. It’s airplane\ntickets. It’s hotels. And it’s a couple of other things. And each of those has a story attached to it\nthat is—that is really about the reopening of the economy.\nSo we look at that, and we think that those are temporary things because the, the supply\nside will respond. The economy will adapt. We have a very adaptive, adaptable, flexible\neconomy and labor market. And it’s a real—a real asset that we have. And so we think that\ninflation should move down over time. Now, we don’t have any—much confidence, let’s say, in\nthe timing of that or the size of the effects in the near term. I would say, in the near term, that\nPage 10 of 29\nJuly 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthe, the, the risks to inflation are probably to the upside. I, I, I have some confidence in the—in\nthe medium term, that inflation will move back down. Again, it’s hard to say when that will be.\nI, I, I will say, though, that, you know, we—inflation is half of our mandate. Price\nstability is half of our mandate. And if we were to see inflation moving up to levels persistently\nthat were—that were above, significantly, materially above our goal and particularly if inflation\nexpectations were to move up, we would use our tools to guide inflation back down to 2 percent.\nSo we won’t have an extended period of, of high inflation. We think that, that some of it\nwill, will fall away naturally as the process of reopening the economy moves through. And it\ncould take some time. In any case, we will use our tools over time as appropriate to make sure\nthat we do have inflation that averages 2 percent over time.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Victoria at Politico.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Mr. Chairman. So bond market pricing seems to suggest that\ninvestors think the Fed might eventually overtighten. So my question is, do you think that\nmarkets have bought into the central bank’s new framework? And how do you balance that with\nmanaging inflation concerns?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, so in terms of what’s been happening in bond markets, I don’t\nthink there’s a real consensus on, on what explains the moves between the last meeting and this\nmeeting. We’ve seen the long-term yields go down significantly. Some of it is a fall in real\nyields, which may have been connected to—some speculate—connected to sentiment around the,\nthe spread of the Delta variant and concern about growth.\nThere was also some decline in inflation compensation, which has significantly reversed.\nAnd there, there are also so-called technical factors, which is where you put things that you can’t\nquite explain. So I, I, I don’t see in any of that that there is really anything that challenges the\nPage 11 of 29\nJuly 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ncredibility of our framework, if, if that’s really your question. We are committed to achieving\n2 percent average inflation over time.\nWhat we said was that, in particular, when we see a very strong labor market, high levels\nof employment, low levels of unemployment, that won’t be enough for us to raise interest rates\nuntil we see some inflation. Of course, what we have today is kind of the opposite. We’ve got,\nyou know, 7 or 8 million people, fewer people, at work than were at work before the pandemic.\nSo we’re, you know, we’re, we’re a ways away from full maximum employment. But we have\nhigh inflation, so it’s kind of the opposite case. And we have to—we have to deal with that.\nAny central bank has to deal with that by looking at the inflation and asking whether it is\nbroad based and likely to be persistent and, and, and whether inflation expectations are\nimplicated in a way that, that could cause them to rise. So we’re monitoring that very carefully,\nand we’re prepared to use our tools as appropriate. But, again, I think our—I think our\nframework is pretty well understood. And, and I think the real test of it will be down the road\nwhen it’s time to think about raising interest rates and, and how we assess, assess that set of\nissues.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We’ll go to Rich at Bloomberg.\nRICH MILLER. Thanks very much, Michelle. Chairman Powell, you, you just alluded\nto the fact that you’re prepared to use your tools to slow the economy down if need be to—if\ninflation looks like it’s getting out of control. I want to just try to understand that in the context\nof the framework and the forward guidance. Does that mean you’d be prepared to raise interest\nrates even if we’re not at maximum employment at that point, should you see this danger of\ninflation? And, and, two, does it also mean you’d be prepared to raise interest rates even if you\nare still buying assets? Thank you.\nPage 12 of 29\nJuly 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. So there’s a—there’s a part in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals\nand, and Monetary Policy Strategy, which, Rich, I’m sure—I’m sure you’re familiar with, which,\nwhich talks about that case in which the two goals are in tension. Most of the time, if you have\nhigh inflation, you also have high employment—they, they tend to go together. This is a\nsituation where they’re temporarily in different directions. We’re not at full employment, but we\nare having high inflation.\nWe feel like we’re going to be making good progress over the next—over the course of\nthe next year, couple of years, really, toward maximum employment. This is a very strong labor\nmarket. If you look at the number of job openings compared to the number of unemployed,\nit’s—we’re, we’re clearly on a path to a very strong labor market with high participation, low\nunemployment, high employment, wages moving up across the spectrum. That, that’s, that’s the\npath that we’re on, and, and it shouldn’t take that long in macroeconomic time to get there.\nSo that’s, that’s what I think is, is really the likely case. And, again, it’s not—it’s not\ntimely for us to be thinking about, about raising interest rates right now. What we’re doing is,\nwe’re, we’re looking at our asset purchases and judging what is right for the economy and\njudging how we—how close we are to substantial further progress and then—and then tapering\nafter that.\nThe question you asked about, would we raise rates if we hadn’t finished cutting—hadn’t\nfinished the taper, hypothetical question. You know, we’d, we’d face the circumstance at the\ntime. We could always just—you know, one thing one could do would be to just cut asset\npurchases all the way to zero if you wanted to do that. But it’s, it’s, it’s just hard to—it’s hard to\nanswer what you would do without knowing a lot more about the situation. Ideally, you\nwouldn’t be still buying assets and raising rates because, of course, you’re adding\nPage 13 of 29\nJuly 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\naccommodation by buying and, and removing accommodation by raising rates. So that wouldn’t\nbe ideal. I’ll say that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We’ll go to Edward Lawrence at Fox Business.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. So thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for\ntaking the question. Now, so you’re talking about jobs. You just said we’re on a path to a very\nstrong job market. You know, we have 9.5 million people unemployed as of the last labor\nmarket survey and 9.2 million job openings. So what’s the—what’s the disconnect? Is it a skills\ngap? Is it the extended unemployment benefits? Is it the fact that people just aren’t willing to\nrelocate? What is the disconnect there?\nCHAIR POWELL. It’s a—it’s a really unusual situation to have—to have the ratio of\nvacancies to unemployed be this high. And we think there are a number of things at work there.\nMaybe the place to start is, is just to say that this is now not so much about people going back to\ntheir old jobs. It’s about finding a new job. So that’s a time-intensive, labor-intensive process.\nAnd there may be a bit of a speed limit on that. There, there’s research that suggests that\nthere is a speed limit on that. So it’s not like you can have millions of people at the beginning of\nthe recovery going back in a single month because they’re just going back to their old job. This\nis about job selection, things like that. There may also be some factors that are—that are holding\npeople back, and that’s—this is what surveys say. There are people who, who are reluctant to go\nback to work because they still feel exposed to COVID. These could be jobs where, where there\nwas a lot of, of interaction with the public and where perhaps there’s a family member who’s\nvulnerable or for whatever reason.\nThere’s also caretakers who are—where, where schools are not fully open and parents are\nat home or taking care of, of, of older people. And there’s also been very generous\nPage 14 of 29\nJuly 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nunemployment benefits, which are now rolling off. They’ll be—they’ll be fully rolled off in a\ncouple of months. And all of those factors should, should wane. And, you know, we, we think\nwe should see, because of that, we should see strong job creation moving forward.\nI mean, ultimately, it’s unusual to see aspects like the job openings number in a context\nwhere there are that many unemployed people. That many job openings would typically suggest\na tight labor market. And, of course, we hear from businesses all over the country that it’s very\nhard to hire people. And that may be because people, people are shopping carefully for their\nnext job. I mean, I, I, I think the bottom line on this is, people want to work. If you look at\nwhere labor force participation can get, people will go back to work unless they retire. Some\npeople will retire. But, generally speaking, Americans want to work, and, and they’ll find their\nway into the jobs that they want. It may take some time, though.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Rachel Siegel at the Washington Post.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Thank you, Michelle. And thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our\nquestions. I wanted to follow up on what you said about there tending to be less in the way of\neconomic implications from each wave of COVID cases. Could you elaborate on what you’ve\nseen to that end during previous waves? And then, looking forward, how vulnerable is the labor\nmarket to the Delta variant?\nI’m thinking or wondering if you have concerns that jobs that may have come back in\ntravel or tourism could be susceptible if people started reconsidering their travel plans or if\ncaretakers were suddenly faced with the prospect of schools not reopening. How do you see\nsome of those risks going forward? Thank you so much.\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So if you remember the, the summer wave last year of\nCOVID, which was largely southern and western states, the economy just performed much better\nPage 15 of 29\nJuly 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthan anyone expected. You know, we, we were coming off the spring wave, where there were a\nlot of shutdowns. And then this big second wave hit, and I think the natural thing to do is to\nexpect that, that it would have a real impact on the economy. And it was much less than, than\npeople thought.\nPeople—what’s happened is, first of all, many people are vaccinated. They’re going on\nwith their lives. Secondly, we’ve kind of learned to live with it. A lot of industries have, have\nkind of improvised their way around it—particularly, for example, buying a new home. That,\nthat process of buying a new home very quickly moved to much more of a virtual process. And\nso they were able to, you know, to, to do that. And other industries as well have gone to take-out\nand, you know, no-contact things. It’s—so that can all—it seems like we’ve learned to, to\nhandle this.\nNow, I think people would like to get back to, to, you know, the way things were. And I,\nI, I hope to some extent, we will over time. You know, of course, the big wave we had last\nwinter did have significant employment effects, particularly in, you know, hospitality and leisure\nand other entertainment—other, other areas with a lot of direct contact. A lot of jobs were lost\nthen because that was a very strong wave that happened in, in, in the winter months last year, just\nbefore the vaccines arrived.\nSo with Delta, we’re just going to have to watch. Again, with, with, with a reasonably\nhigh percentage of the country vaccinated and the vaccine apparently being effective—we’re not\nexperts on this—but it, it seems like the—a good—a good going-in estimate would be that the\neffects will probably be less. There probably won’t be significant lockdowns and things like\nthat. But, again, those, those are not decisions for us or, or, or—nor is it something we’re be—\nwe’d be expert in.\nPage 16 of 29\nJuly 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nIn terms of the, the, the channels, you know, I—this is—this is kind of speculation, but\nit’s pretty—it just is that people, you could imagine school districts deciding to wait a month or\ntwo for the—for the—for the Delta wave to go. I’m not saying this’ll happen, but that it’s easy\nto imagine that. It’s also easy to imagine that some people might say, you know what? I’m just\ngoing to—I’m just going to wait a couple of months before going back to work. Wouldn’t be\nhard to imagine that happening.\nIf, if schools don’t open, then caretakers have to stay home. And if people don’t go back\ninto the labor force, then the job growth won’t be as strong, those kinds of things. So I don’t—it\ndoesn’t—it doesn’t—again, sitting here today, not being able to really know the future—it\ndoesn’t seem as though the effects will be very large. But there may be effects. And they—it\nmay be that the effect is to slow the economy down just for a period of months—or not. There\nare many parts of the country where it might not have an effect, and we’re just going to have to,\nto see what the economic effects are.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Now we’ll go to David Gura at NPR.\nDAVID GURA. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I was going to ask if you’ve started drafting\nyour Jackson Hole speech, but I’m going to go in a—in a different direction here. Steve\nLiesman asked you about semantics. I’m going to take a cue from him and ask you about the\nterm “transitory,” because I think of you as somebody who’s so lucidly explained policies and\nprograms in recent months and made a real concerted effort to explain them to, to the American\npublic as a whole. I wonder about this term and what you would say to people who don’t know\nit definitionally, don’t know what it means, and see prices going up and wonder how long they’re\ngoing to have to wait.\nPage 17 of 29\nJuly 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nSo just some broader definition from you—I’d like to hear just about what it means or\nhow you understand it. And, and quickly as well, you’ve talked about vaccines a bit. And your\ncolleague in Minneapolis has placed a mandate on vaccinating employees coming back to that\nFederal Reserve Bank. And I wonder if that’s something that you would like to see or expect to\nsee Systemwide going forward.\nCHAIR POWELL. The concept of “transitory” is really this: It is that the increases will\nhappen. We’re not saying they will reverse. That’s not what “transitory” means. It means that\nthe increases in prices will happen, so there will be inflation but that the process of inflation will\nstop so that—so that there won’t be further—when, when we think of inflation, we really think\nof inflation going up year upon year upon year upon year. That’s inflation.\nWhen you have inflation for 12 months or whatever it might be—I’m just taking an\nexample; I’m not making an estimate—then, then you have a price increase, but you don’t have\nan inflation process. And so part of that just is that, if it doesn’t affect longer-term inflation\nexpectations, then it’s very likely not to infect—to affect the process of inflation going forward.\nSo what, what I mean by “transitory” is just something that doesn’t leave a permanent\nmark on the inflation process. Again, we don’t mean—I don’t mean that, that, that, that, you\nknow, producers are going to take those price increases back. That’s, that’s not the idea. It’s just\nthat they won’t go on indefinitely. So to the extent people are, are, are implementing price\nincreases because raw materials are going up or labor costs or something’s going up, you know,\nthe question, really, for inflation really is, does that mean they’re going to go up the next year by\nthe same amount?\nSo you’re going to be in a process where inflation, the inflation process, gets going. And,\nand that happens because people’s expectations about future inflation move up. And we don’t\nPage 18 of 29\nJuly 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthink that’s happening. There’s no evidence that it’s happening. All the evidence is that it’s not\nhappening. But, nonetheless, we have to watch this very carefully because this is—you know,\nwe have two mandates: maximum employment and price stability. Price stability, for us, means\ninflation averaging 2 percent over time. And so we’ve got to be very careful about that.\nBut, but I, I, I think it’s a good point that it’s, it’s a term—what it really means is\ntemporary. But then you’ve got to understand that it doesn’t mean that the—that the increases\nwill be taken back. Some of them will be, but, but that’s not really what it means.\nIn terms of—so we’re, we’re working virtually here, and we’ll be coming back down the\nroad in a couple of months, starting to bring people back here at the Board of Governors in\nWashington. And, you know, we’re going to follow public health guidance and things like that.\nWe really haven’t made the fundamental decisions about exactly what that will look like. And\nit’ll depend on, to some extent, on what—on what, you know, CDC guidance looks like when we\nactually do bring people back in.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We’ll go to Michael McKee at Bloomberg TV.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Chairman, I wanted to ask you a little bit about your taper timeline\nin the sense that you said you want a couple more months of data. And the statement says that\nthe Fed is going to use—to, to evaluate the developments in the two markets, in jobs and\ninflation, in coming meetings. Does that suggest that we wouldn’t see anything before\nSeptember or November in your meetings? And I know a lot of people on Wall Street have\nbasically felt you’re going to lay out your taper plans at Jackson Hole. Is that—is that the plan,\nor are we not going to see anything until the fall?\nCHAIR POWELL. So in any decisions about the timing, and I did not—if I—if I said\nwe’re looking at wanting a couple more months of data, I wasn’t—I’m not meaning to suggest\nPage 19 of 29\nJuly 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nanything about a particular time at which we might taper, because we really have not made that\ndecision. All I’m saying is, is, we’re not at substantial further progress. There’s a range of\nviews on, on what timing will be appropriate. And those views ultimately track, track back to\npeople’s views about the economy and, and what will happen as we make progress towards,\ntowards our—towards our goal.\nSo that’s, that’s really what it is. And I, I—we will, of course, as we—you know, we’re\ngoing to continue to try to provide clarity as appropriate on, on timing, pace, and composition.\nBut, today, I’ve, I’ve given you what I can give you because, again, this, this was the first, really,\nI would say, deep dive on the issues of timing, pace, and composition. And it was a good\nmeeting. And—but no decisions are made, and, and I’m just not in a position to, to give you\nmuch guidance, really any guidance, on the actual timing.\nI—but I will say we’re making progress. We expect further progress. And we expect\nthat, if, if things go well, then we will—we will reach that goal. And when we reach it and the\nCommittee is comfortable that we have reached it, then, then we’ll taper at that point. I can’t, I\nreally—there’s nothing I can say about Jackson Hole. You know, I’m in—we’re in the process\nof writing that speech. And I am going to give a speech, and—but I, I, I wouldn’t want to—I\nwouldn’t want to say what will be in there at this point.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Well, if I could follow up, several people have recently noted that\nthe Fed has got the markets working well. And you’ve got bank loans up. In other words,\nyou’ve stimulated demand. But savers and companies, like insurance companies and pension\nfunds, are getting hammered by the low rates. And they’re wondering if the balance hasn’t\nstarted to shift away from benefiting the economy to doing more harm than good.\nPage 20 of 29\nJuly 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. We—asset purchases were just a key part of our response to the\ncritical phase of the crisis. They, they really helped us restore market function to these key\nmarkets, really, on which—on which, which are very, very important to our economy and the\nglobal economy. And then they were a big part of, of creating accommodative financial\nconditions to support demand. They were strongly needed.\nIt was that commitment to continue asset purchases that provided strong support for the\neconomy and, and has been a part of the story for why the economy is so strong right now. So\nwe said we would taper when we—when we achieve substantial further progress. And, and, you\nknow, we’re going to honor that commitment. I mean, it’s—and, and, again, we’re talking about\nit right now and meeting by meeting and, and moving in that direction. We will taper when we\nreach that goal. And we’ll provide more, you know, more clarity on that as we go, as is\nappropriate.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We’ll go to Hannah Lang at the American Banker.\nHANNAH LANG. Hi. You’ve been asked a lot previously if the Fed’s monetary policy\nat all contributes to inequality, but I was really curious to know where you think the Fed’s\nregulatory policy lands, particularly if you think that the Fed’s bank capital requirements have\nhad the effect of penalizing lower-income households seeking loans. Basically, is it possible to\nachieve the balance of a safe banking system with one that also provides equitable loan access?\nThanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, I think strong capital requirements are essential for banks,\nparticularly for the largest banks. And I think that an undercapitalized banking system, as we’ve\nseen, can be a real threat to the economy and most—mostly, or to, to the greatest extent, to\nPage 21 of 29\nJuly 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\npeople at the lower end of the income spectrum. So if you look back at not this previous—not\nthis crisis but the previous one, the bank—the banking system was undercapitalized.\nSo higher capital requirements are, are, you know, are, are really a good thing because\nthey allow banks to weather downturns and continue to perform the functions that they perform.\nI think it’s other tools that we have to—and the Fed has some of these tools, Congress has some\nof these tools, other agencies have some of these tools—to assure or support the wide availability\nof credit, particularly to low- and moderate-income communities.\nSo that’s CRA. We enforce CRA. We’re working on a—on a new CRA proposal right\nnow with the other banking agencies, and we think it’s going to be—it’s going to be good and\nwill support the flow of credit to low- and moderate-income households. It’s also the anti—anti–\nlending discrimination statutes that we enforce. And it’s some of the programs that Congress has\nin place to support the flow of credit to low- and moderate-income communities. I, I don’t think\nit’s capital standards at all. I think capital standards work the other way. Strong capital is what\nenables banks to continue to serve their communities, including low- and moderate-income\ncommunities.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We’ll go to Chris Rugaber at the AP.\nCHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Chair Powell, I\nguess I wanted to ask about the last—when you were before Congress earlier this month, you\nmentioned, I think, something along the lines of, it won’t take too long before we see if you’re\nright about inflation and its temporary aspect. You also mentioned learning a lot more in the\nnext six months about the economy. Can you tell us a little more of what you mean by that?\nWhen do you think you’ll get a clean reading on inflation that is free of most of the distortions\nthat we’re seeing now?\nPage 22 of 29\nJuly 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. Right. So with inflation, as I mentioned, we’re, we look not just at\nthe headline number, but we look at all the components that go into the calculation of inflation.\nAnd if you do that, if you look under the hood, what you see is not that, widely, across the whole\nrange of goods and services that, that are in the economy, we’re seeing upward, upward pressure\non prices. That’s not really what we’re seeing.\nWhat we’re seeing is a handful of things that are really—that really account for the, the\novershoot of inflation. And, as I mentioned, it’s things like cars. You know, new, used, and\nrental cars have moved up in price because of the car shortage because of the semiconductor\nshortage. And housing—sorry, hotels and air, air fares have moved back up, but that really just\nis retracing the very large downward movement in prices that they had before.\nSo that’s, that’s a big, big part of, of why the inflation readings are so high. And those\ndon’t—those, frankly, don’t carry significant implications in the long run for the—for inflation\nor for the American economy. So what I said was, we, we’re going to see whether these\nthings—we don’t need to see everything do what lumber prices have done. So if you look at\nlumber prices, they went up and then they went down.\nSo what we want to see is these other things. Do they—do they—do the prices flatten\nout? Do they actually move down? If they flatten out, then their, their contribution to inflation\nbecomes zero over time so that they’re not contributing to inflation. And so, if we start to see\nthose things happen fairly widely among the—among the things that have really moved up\nquickly, then we’ll, we’ll—they won’t all happen at once or happen quickly—but we’ll know\nthat our basic understanding of the situation is broadly correct.\nAnd I don’t think it will take, or what I said was, I don’t think it’ll take a very long time\nto see whether that’s the case. It, it, it is probably the case that, frankly, the, the overall\nPage 23 of 29\nJuly 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nreopening of the economy is going to play out over a period of time. This is a historic, world\nhistorical event, that the global economy is now reopening. It’s not going to—it’s not going to\nhappen quickly. It’s going to take some time.\nAnd it’s going to be very uneven, as we discussed before. But I think we will—we will\nknow, you know, when we know. But I don’t think it will take that long. I don’t want to put a\nnumber on it. But I do think that, that, if we see those things happening, we’ll know that we\nhave the story basically right.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We’ll go to Brian Cheung at Yahoo Finance.\nBRIAN CHEUNG. Hi, Chairman Powell. Brian Cheung, Yahoo Finance. I’m just\nwondering if you could provide a little bit more color in terms of how you’re thinking about\nmortgage-backed securities purchases as you inch towards taper. Within the context of home\nprices continuing to rise, we’ve heard a lot of people talk about the idea that maybe they’d like to\ncool off on, specifically, the MBS purchases. Is that more because of the optics, or is it because\nthere’s an observed relationship from the Committee’s view between MBS purchases under QE\nand the hot housing market? Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. So a number of participants raised that—the questions around MBS\nand tapering at, at today’s meeting, as a matter of fact, and yesterday’s meeting. And I’ll just say\nthat, generally speaking, I don’t think and—I don’t think that—I think that Treasury and MBS\npurchases affect financial conditions in very similar ways. There may be modest differences in\nterms of, of contribution to housing prices, but it’s, it’s not something that’s big.\nIt’s not—it’s—so where I think we are is, there, there really is little support for the idea\nof tapering MBS earlier than Treasuries. I think we will taper them at the same time. It seems\nlikely, based on where people are now. The idea of reducing MBS purchases at a somewhat\nPage 24 of 29\nJuly 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nfaster pace than Treasuries does have some attraction for some people—others, not so much.\nAnd I think it’s something that we’ll be continuing to discuss.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let’s go to Michael Derby.\nMICHAEL DERBY. Thank you very much. So I wanted to ask you about the standing\nrepo facility and get your sense of what you think it will do for market trading conditions. And\nalso, kind of in a similarly related point, the reverse repo numbers have just gotten even bigger\nsince you raised the reverse repo rate at the last Fed meeting. And, you know, are you concerned\nto see, you know, nearly $1 trillion a day, you know, pouring in through that facility?\nCHAIR POWELL. So on the standing repo facility, what is it going to do? So it, it\nreally is a backstop. So it’s, it’s set at 25 basis points, so out of the money, and it’s, it’s there to\nhelp address pressures in money market—money markets that could impede the effective\nimplementation of monetary policy. So, really, it’s, it’s to support the function of—functioning\nof monetary policy and its, its effectiveness. That’s the purpose of it. And it’s set up with that\npurpose in mind.\nYour question on, on the, the [ON]RRP, so we think it’s doing what it’s supposed to do,\nwhat we expect of it to do, which is to help provide a floor for money market rates and help\nensure that the federal funds, funds rate stays within the target range. You know, it’s essentially,\nessentially, what’s happening is that it just results in a lower aggregate amount of Federal\nReserve liabilities that are in banks in the form of reserves and a higher amount of Federal\nReserve liabilities in money market funds in the form of overnight RRP balances.\nSo that, that’s all that’s really happening there. And we expect it to be high for some\ntime. It’s being driven, of course, by, by the relatively lower quantity of Treasury bills and, and,\nPage 25 of 29\nJuly 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nand also the onset of the debt ceiling and the decline in the TGA, things like that. So we don’t—\nwe don’t have a problem with, with what it’s doing. It’s kind of doing the job we expected.\nMICHAEL DERBY. And you don’t see any issues with, like, disaggregating, you know,\nmarkets from, you know, investing in private money market securities? You know, like, the idea\nthat the Fed’s footprint in money markets is getting too big, you don’t see any issues there?\nCHAIR POWELL. Not, not really. Not at this point. I mean, money markets, private\nmoney market funds are, are choosing to, to invest because the rates are attractive. At some\npoint, the rates will not be so attractive as, as the whole rate cluster normalizes, and, and you’ll\nsee it shrink back down.\nMICHAEL DERBY. Okay. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thanks. Let’s go to Greg Robb at MarketWatch.\nGREG ROBB. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Chair Powell, I was going to go\nback to inflation a little bit. I’m just kind of surprised by your tone. It, it seems like you’re just\nsort of warning that, if inflation gets too high, you know, the Fed will act. Isn’t it true that, I\nmean, a little inflation is good for the economy and, and that we—if somehow maybe we can get\nthe economy out of this sort of place where we’re always going to be close to the zero lower\nbound, isn’t there a good story to tell, and you’re sort of panicking people?\nCHAIR POWELL. I certainly don’t, don’t have that in mind. No. Look, we—as you\nknow, we’re targeting a moderate overshoot of 2 percent inflation for some time. We, we want\ninflation expectations to be centered on, on 2 percent. We feel like they may be a little bit below\nthat. So the bigger picture is that, you know, that, that, that would be a healthy thing. This is a\ndifferent thing. This is—this is not that. That was the kind of inflation we were thinking about\nthat comes from, you know, from a very, very strong labor market and a—and a booming\nPage 26 of 29\nJuly 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\neconomy maybe. That, that was the kind of inflation—this, this is something different. This is\nreally driven by the supply side, which is not able to hand—to handle this big spike in demand\nthat we’re seeing. As the economy reopens with vaccination and fiscal support and monetary\npolicy support, the supply side—just all over the world, you’re seeing the same thing, which is, it\njust can’t keep up. And there are labor shortages in, in a lot of places, the same sort of thing.\nSo, you know, there’s, there’s absolutely no sense of panic. I just—I’ve explained, I\nthink, several times here today that the best—my, my best estimate is that this is something that\nwill pass. It’s really a shock to the economy that will pass through. And, you know, if you—if\nyou look at where forecasters are—people who actually write down a forecast for a living—very,\nvery strongly they see it that way.\nNow, we—but, you know, are—we’re actually responsible for this, though, so we have to\ntake seriously the risk, the risk case, which is that inflation will be more persistent, that it might\nactually move inflation expectations up, and that we might—that the kind of things that might\nrequire a response. We, again, we don’t see that now. But we, we have to be on the alert for it.\nAnd people have to understand and believe that we will react if, if we need to. And we will.\nBut, again, it’s not—it’s not my base case. My base case is that—is, as I’ve said\nrepeatedly, is that inflation will move back down. And no, we’re not—we, we have not at all\nchanged our view, and I haven’t changed my view that inflation running above 2 percent,\nmoderately above 2 percent, is a desirable thing. This is not moderately above 2 percent. This is\nwell above 2 percent. But it’s also not the kind of inflation we were looking for. This is really\ndriven by a supply-side shock.\nGREG ROBB. Thank you.\nPage 27 of 29\nJuly 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We’ll go to Don Lee at the Los Angeles Times for the\nlast question.\nDON LEE. Hi, Chair Powell. I wonder if you could talk about wages. Many workers\nseem to have gotten some good wage gains in, in recent months. What can workers generally\nexpect going forward? And it doesn’t sound like you’re concerned about rising wages feeding\ninto broader inflation. Is that right?\nCHAIR POWELL. So wages have moved up. A lot of that is driven by new hires. And\nit’s—a lot of it is driven at relatively low-paid jobs in the service industries as people come back.\nSo that’s not troubling. And we, we don’t see—there, there is a form of wage inflation that can\nlead to price inflation, and we’re not seeing that right now.\nAnd that really is if what we call “unit labor costs” move up and, and, and, which really\nputs—move up in a way that is—that is hard for companies to manage and puts them in a\nsituation where they have to accept substantially lower margins or raise prices. Now, when it\nhappens gradually, when that—if you—we’ve seen in a long expansion, sometimes unit labor\ncosts do move up and, and put some pressure on margins. In a long expansion, that’s been\nhappening late in the expansion. That’s not a problem, either.\nThe problem is if it happens in a way that pushes firms broadly into raising prices. It was\ncalled the “wage–price spiral.” We don’t see that now. This is something that was a feature of\nthe high inflationary era of the Great Inflation, but it’s not a feature now. And we don’t see that\nnow. Of course, we’ll be watching it.\nAnd this is one of the reasons why we’re watching so carefully to see whether labor\nforce—whether people do come back and accept jobs. Given the very large number of job\nopenings and the very large number of unemployed people, we’d like to see, you know, those—\nPage 28 of 29\nJuly 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nsome matching going on there so people get back to work. We think labor supply would be—\nwould be a healthy thing. You know, but wages moving up across the spectrum, consistent with\ninflation and productivity, is a—is a good thing.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you, Chair Powell. And thank you all.\nPage 29 of 29"

The sectors most adversely\naffected by the pandemic have improved in recent months, but the rise in COVID-19\ncases has slowed their recovery. Inflation is elevated, largely reflecting transitory\nfactors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy\nmeasures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and\nbusinesses.\nThe path of the economy continues to depend on the course of the virus. Progress\non vaccinations will likely continue to reduce the effects of the public health crisis on\nthe economy, but risks to the economic outlook remain.\nThe Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate\nof 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation having run persistently below this\nlonger-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above\n2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer term\ninflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. The Committee expects to\n‑\nmaintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are\nachieved. The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate\nat 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until\nlabor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s\n(more)\nFor release at 2 p.m. EDT September 22, 2021\n-2-\nassessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on\ntrack to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.

Since then, the economy has made\nprogress toward these goals. If progress continues broadly as expected, the\nCommittee judges that a moderation in the pace of asset purchases may soon be\nwarranted. These asset purchases help foster smooth market functioning and\naccommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to\nhouseholds and businesses.\nIn assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will\ncontinue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic\noutlook.

    "press_conf": "September 22, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nTranscript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference\nSeptember 22, 2021\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed\nto achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and\nprice stability.\nToday, the Federal Open Market Committee kept interest rates near zero and maintained\nour current pace of asset purchases. These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest\nrates and on our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to support the\neconomy until the recovery is complete.\nProgress on vaccinations and unprecedented fiscal policy actions are also providing\nstrong support to the recovery. Indicators of economic activity and employment have continued\nto strengthen. Real GDP rose at a robust 6.4 percent pace in the first half of the year, and growth\nis widely expected to continue at a strong pace in the second half. The sectors most adversely\naffected by the pandemic have improved in recent months, but the rise in COVID-19 cases has\nslowed their recovery. Household spending rose at an especially rapid pace over the first half of\nthe year but flattened out in July and August as spending softened in COVID-sensitive sectors,\nsuch as travel and restaurants.\nAdditionally, in some industries, near-term supply constraints are restraining activity.\nThese constraints are particularly acute in the motor vehicle industry, where the worldwide\nshortage of semiconductors has sharply curtailed production. Partly reflecting the effects of the\nvirus and supply constraints, forecasts from FOMC participants for economic growth this year\nhave been revised somewhat lower since our June Summary of Economic Projections, but\nparticipants still foresee rapid growth.\nPage 1 of 27\nSeptember 22, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nAs with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have continued to\nimprove. Demand for labor is very strong, and job gains averaged 750,000 per month over the\npast three months. In August, however, job gains slowed markedly, with the slowdown\nconcentrated in sectors most sensitive to the pandemic, including leisure and hospitality. The\nunemployment rate was 5.2 percent in August, and this figure understates the shortfall in\nemployment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low\nrates that have prevailed for most of the past year.\nFactors related to the pandemic, such as caregiving needs and ongoing fears of the virus,\nappear to be weighing on employment growth. These factors should diminish with progress on\ncontaining the virus, leading to more rapid gains in employment. Looking ahead, FOMC\nparticipants project the labor market to continue to improve, with the median projection for the\nunemployment rate standing at 4.8 percent at the end of this year and 3.5 percent in 2023\nand ’24.\nThe economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to\nshoulder the burden have been hardest hit. In particular, despite progress, joblessness continues\nto fall disproportionately on lower-wage workers in the service sector and on African Americans\nand Hispanics.\nInflation is elevated and will likely remain so in coming months before moderating. As\nthe economy continues to reopen and spending rebounds, we are seeing upward pressure on\nprices, particularly because supply bottlenecks in some sectors have limited how quickly\nproduction can respond in the near term. These bottleneck effects have been larger and longer\nlasting than anticipated, leading to upward revisions to participants’ inflation projections for this\nyear. While these supply effects are prominent for now, they will abate, and as they do, inflation\nPage 2 of 27\nSeptember 22, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nis expected to drop back toward our longer-run goal. The median inflation projection from\nFOMC participants falls from 4.2 percent this year to 2.2 percent next year.\nThe process of reopening the economy is unprecedented, as was the shutdown at the\nonset of the pandemic. As the reopening continues, bottlenecks, hiring difficulties, and other\nconstraints could again prove to be greater and longer lasting than anticipated, posing upside\nrisks to inflation. Our framework for monetary policy emphasizes the importance of having\nwell-anchored inflation expectations, both to foster price stability and to enhance our ability to\npromote our broad-based and inclusive maximum-employment goal. Indicators of longer-term\ninflation expectations appear broadly consistent with our longer-run inflation goal of 2 percent.\nIf sustained higher inflation were to become a serious concern, we would certainly respond and\nuse our tools to assure that inflation runs at levels that are consistent with our goal.\nThe path of the economy continues to depend on the course of the virus, and risks to the\neconomic outlook remain. The Delta variant has led to significant increases in COVID-19 cases,\nresulting in significant hardship and loss and slowing the economic recovery. Continued\nprogress on vaccinations would help contain the virus and support a return to more normal\neconomic conditions.\nThe Fed’s policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to\npromote the stability of the financial system. Our asset purchases have been a critical tool. They\nhelped preserve financial stability and market functioning early in the pandemic and since then\nhave helped foster accommodative financial conditions to support the economy.\nAt our meeting that concluded earlier today, the Committee continued to discuss the\nprogress made toward our goals since the Committee adopted its asset purchase guidance last\nPage 3 of 27\nSeptember 22, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nDecember. Since then, the economy has made progress toward these goals. If progress\ncontinues broadly as expected, the Committee judges that a moderation in the pace of asset\npurchases may soon be warranted.\nWe also discussed the appropriate pace of tapering asset purchases once economic\nconditions satisfy the criterion laid out in the Committee’s guidance. While no decisions were\nmade, participants generally view that, so long as the recovery remains on track, a gradual\ntapering process that concludes around the middle of next year is likely to be appropriate. Even\nafter our balance sheet stops expanding, our elevated holdings of longer-term securities will\ncontinue to support accommodative financial conditions.\nThe timing and pace of the coming reduction in asset purchases will not be intended to\ncarry a direct signal regarding the timing of interest rate liftoff, for which we have articulated a\ndifferent and substantially more stringent test. We continue to expect that it will be appropriate\nto maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market\nconditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessment of maximum\nemployment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent\nfor some time. Half of FOMC participants forecast that these favorable economic conditions\nwill be fulfilled by the end of next year; as a result, the median projection for the appropriate\nlevel of the federal funds rate lies slightly above the effective lower bound in 2022.\nParticipants generally expect a gradual pace of policy firming that would leave the level\nof the federal funds rate below estimates of its longer-run level through 2024. Of course, these\nprojections do not represent a Committee decision or plan, and no one knows with any certainty\nwhere the economy will be a year or more from now. More important than any forecast is the\nPage 4 of 27\nSeptember 22, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nfact that policy will remain accommodative until we have achieved our maximum-employment\nand price-stability goals.\nTo conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses\nacross the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do\neverything we can to support the economy for as long as it takes to complete the recovery.\nThank you, and I look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We’ll go first to Rachel Siegel.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Thank you, Michelle. And thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our\nquestions. When it comes to the taper and, eventually, to any rate increases, I’m wondering if\nyou can walk us through what “substantial further progress” looks like, given the latest batch of\nprojections that have PCE inflation coming in a little higher than the June projection, the\nunemployment rate also being higher than June, as well as the change to GDP lower than June.\nIf you could help us make sense of all those things as you sort through what “substantial further\nprogress” looks like, that would be great.\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So the test for beginning our taper is that we’ve achieved\nsubstantial further progress toward our goals of [2 percent] inflation and maximum employment.\nAnd for inflation, we appear to have achieved more than significant progress—substantial further\nprogress. So that part of the test is achieved, in my view and in the view of many others. So the\nquestion is really on the maximum-employment test. So if you look at a good number of\nindicators, you will see that, since last December, when we articulated the test, and the readings\ntoday, in many cases more than half of the distance, for example, between the unemployment\nrate in December of 2020 and typical estimates of the natural rate—50 or 60 percent of that road\nhas been traveled. So that could be substantial further progress.\nPage 5 of 27\nSeptember 22, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMany on the Committee feel that the “substantial further progress” test for employment\nhas been met. Others feel that it’s close, but they want to see a little more progress. There’s a\nrange of perspectives. I guess my own view would be that the test—the “substantial further\nprogress” test for employment is all but met. And so, once we’ve met those two tests, once the\nCommittee decides that they’ve met [them]—and that could come as soon as the next meeting;\nthat’s the purpose of that language, is to put notice out that that could come as soon as the next\nmeeting. The Committee will consider that test, and we’ll also look at the broader environment\nat that time and make a decision whether to taper.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We’ll go to Howard Schneider.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thanks, Chair Powell. Thanks, Michelle. So, looking at the\nSEPs, we got now basically four years of inflation above target, and policy never gets to the\nlong-run rate. I’m wondering if you could address that from two perspectives: one, within the\nnew framework that the Fed adopted last year and, second, from the perspective of the average\nhousehold that’s now being asked to pay higher prices and increasingly higher prices for four\nyears running when, for some this year, real wages have actually gone down.\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So, as you can see, the inflation forecasts have moved up a bit\nin the outyears. And that’s really, I think, a reflection of—and they’ve moved up significantly\nfor this year. And that’s, I think, a reflection of the fact that the bottlenecks and shortages that\nare being—that we’re seeing in the economy have really not begun to abate in a meaningful way\nyet. So those seem to be going to be with us at least for a few more months and perhaps into\nnext year. So that suggests that inflation’s going to be higher this year, and a number—I guess\nthe inflation rates for next year and 2023 were also marked up, but just by a couple of tenths.\nWhy—those are very modest overshoots. You’re looking at 2.2 and 2.1, you know, two years\nPage 6 of 27\nSeptember 22, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nand three years out. These are very, very—I don’t think that households are going to, you know,\nnotice a couple of tenths of an overshoot. That just happens to be people’s forecasts.\nYou know, we want to foster a strong labor market, and we want to foster inflation\naveraging 2 percent over time, and I think we’re very much on track to achieve those things. In\nterms of the framework, I see this as very consistent with the framework. We want inflation\nexpectations to be anchored at around 2 percent. We want, we’re—that’s really the ultimate test\nof whether we’re getting this done under the framework. And, you know, we do want inflation\nto run moderately above 2 percent. I wouldn’t put too much on a couple of tenths over 2 percent\nin 2023 and ’24—one-tenth in ’24. But you’re right, those are the numbers.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let’s go to Colby Smith.\nCOLBY SMITH. Chair Powell—thank you, Michelle. Chair Powell, you mentioned\nongoing discussions about the tapering timeline, and I’m wondering what the contours of that\ndebate have been. For those that want to move a bit more quickly, is it about maintaining\noptionality for a 2022 interest rate increase? Or is it about financial stability risks? Or concerns\nabout the efficacy of asset purchases at a time when we have supply constraints? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So let me say that there’s very broad support on the Committee for\nthis plan, both as to the timing and as to the pace of the taper. So this was a unanimous vote\ntoday, and I’d say quite broad support for this approach. You’re correct that there are some who\nwould prefer to have gone sooner, and they’ve made their arguments publicly. For some of\nthem, it’s a financial stability concern. And for others, it’s other concerns. They can make their\nown arguments. This is an approach that the Committee will broadly support, and it will put us\nhaving completed our taper sometime around the middle of next year, which seems appropriate.\nPage 7 of 27\nSeptember 22, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nYou know, the asset purchases, as I mentioned, were very, very important at the—in the\nearly stages of the crisis. They were essential in restoring market function in the Treasury and\nother markets. Then, as the recovery got going, they supported aggregate demand, as they will\ndo. And now we’re in a situation where they still have a use, but it’s time for us to begin to taper\nthem. Their usefulness is much less as a tool than it was at the very beginning.\nAnd, of course, this leaves the whole question of rate increases ahead, which is really\nwhere the framework—the framework is all about how we deal with rate increases and that sort\nof thing. So we think this is the appropriate way to go. And, again, broad support on the\nCommittee.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We’ll go to Nick Timiraos.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Hi, Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, you\nhave said the test for liftoff is more stringent than the test for tapering. But if the near-term\nprojections today are credible, more of your colleagues seem to think that rate liftoff, and not just\na taper, may be closer at hand. Does the Committee have a different opinion than you do about\nthe threshold for liftoff that you’ve articulated? Or do they believe that either inflation or\neconomic growth will necessitate a rate increase sooner than you do?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, so, again, substantial further progress toward our goals is the\ntest for beginning the taper. And the taper takes some months in everyone’s figuring. So you’re\ngoing to be well away from satisfying the liftoff test when we begin the taper. So in terms of the\nliftoff test, though, you know, it’s what we adopted last September. It’s labor market conditions\nconsistent with maximum employment. And while we have interesting signs that, in many ways,\nthe labor market’s very tight, we also have lots of slack in the labor market, and we think that\nthose imbalances will sort themself out. Inflation at 2 percent and on track to achieve it,\nPage 8 of 27\nSeptember 22, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nmoderately higher inflation over 2 percent—you know, that really depends on the path of\ninflation. If inflation remains higher during the course of 2022, then we may already have met\nthat test by the time we reach liftoff.\nSo I just think, if you look at what people are writing down for year-end 2022 numbers,\nsome people are writing down very low unemployment rates. And that’s only one indicator, but\nit suggests a very strong labor market. And I think they’re writing down in good faith what they\nsee as meeting the test. There’s a range of perspectives about where the economy will be, but—\nby the way, all but one participants have us lifting off during 2023. So it’s not really an\nunusually wide array of views about this.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. We’ll go to Jeanna Smialek.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Hey, Chair Powell—thank you for taking our questions. Prior to\nrecent media reports, were you aware of the kind of security buying and selling that Presidents\nKaplan and Rosengren were participating in last year? And I wonder if you thought those were\nappropriate.\nCHAIR POWELL. So, no, I was not aware of the specifics of what they were doing. So\nlet me just say a couple things about this subject. We understand very well that the trust of the\nAmerican people is essential for us to effectively carry out our mission. And that’s why I\ndirected the Fed to begin a comprehensive review of the ethics rules around permissible financial\nholdings and activity by Fed officials. So those rules are, in many respects, the same as those for\ngovernment agencies, plus a number of things that apply specifically to us because of our\nbusiness.\nPage 9 of 27\nSeptember 22, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nOne of those is—sort of, three things I would point to in terms of specific restrictures.\nOne is, ownership of certain assets is not allowed, and that’s bank securities and other things.\nSecondly, there are times when we’re not allowed to trade at all or to, you know, buy and sell\nfinancial assets. And that’s the period immediately before and during an FOMC meeting. And,\nthird, there’s regular disclosure. So all of these—everyone’s, you know, ownership and\nactivities are all disclosed on an annual basis.\nSo, you know, I would have had to go back and read people’s financial disclosures to\nknow what their activities have been. This has been our framework for a long time, and I guess\nyou’d say it’s served us well. The other thing you would say—that it is now clearly seen as not\nadequate to the task of really sustaining the public’s trust in us. We need to make changes, and\nwe’re going to do that as a consequence of this. This will be a thoroughgoing and\ncomprehensive review. We’re going to gather all the facts and look at ways to further tighten\nour rules and standards.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Great. Thank you. We’ll go to Steve Liesman.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to follow up on\nJeanna’s question, the issue of ownership of these stocks and trades. Do you think it’s\nappropriate for Federal Reserve officials to be owning the same assets that the Federal Reserve is\nbuying? Is that one of the modifications that you’re looking at? And in that these—you said\nyourself, they’re clearly not seen as appropriate. In that the Fed’s code of conduct says Fed\nofficials should avoid even the appearance of the, of conflict, do those trades, in fact—and\nholdings—violate the Fed’s code of conduct? Finally, do you have a timeline as to when you\nmight get—be done with your review? Thank you, sir.\nPage 10 of 27\nSeptember 22, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. Don’t have a timeline yet; we can start with that. So, well, let me\naddress the muni question, since that’s in there. You know, I personally owned municipal\nsecurities for many, many years, and in 2019, I froze that. Meaning I—they’re no—I’m holding\nall those securities, my wife and I, to maturity. And munis were always thought to be a pretty\nsafe place for a Fed person to invest because, as you know, the lore was that the Fed would never\nbuy municipal securities. So it was not an uncommon thing.\nAnd so then comes the, you know, the COVID crisis, and I reversed that policy, and I did\nit without hesitating. And the reason was that the financial markets, including the municipal\nfinancial market, were very much on the verge of collapse. And it was time to go, and we did.\nBut we also checked with the Office of Government Ethics and—who looked carefully at it and\nsaid that I didn’t have a conflict. So that’s one answer that I wanted to share with you.\nSecondly, you’re right, though, as—we’re going to be looking at all those things. I don’t\nwant to get ahead of the process here and speculate about particular outcomes. But this, again,\ncomprehensive and deliberate process—we’re going to make changes. I want to be able to look\nback on this years from now and know that we rose to meet this challenge and handled the\nsituation well, and that what we did made a lot of sense and protected the public’s interest and\nthe institution that we’re all a part of.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. I’m sorry, Chair Powell—I just want to follow up. You said I was\nright. When you said “right,” about that the Feds should not own—Federal Reserve officials\nshould not own the same assets they’re buying? Is that—\nCHAIR POWELL. I think that’s a reasonable thing. Yeah, and, of course, for the most\npart, we don’t. I mean, it was a real coincidence; I happened to pre-own these munis. They were\nbought many years ago, actually. And so we started buying munis as part of the Municipal\nPage 11 of 27\nSeptember 22, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nLiquidity Facility. So it was really not a—it just was an unforeseen event. And I couldn’t sell\nthem, so what I did was, I just held them, checked with the ethics people, and went ahead. So,\nbut as a general principle, yeah, that makes a lot of sense.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We’ll go to Chris Rugaber.\nCHRIS RUGABER. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Chair Powell. Wider question\nabout jobs and the Fed’s schedule—the Fed’s policy framework that you laid out here. You and\nother Fed officials have often talked about expecting a job market pickup in September as more\nchildren return to school, freeing up more parents to work, COVID abating. You mentioned in\nthe past the extra unemployment benefits expiring. There’s some real-time data suggesting that\nwe may not be seeing much of a return of labor supply. So do you still expect to see that in the\nnext couple of jobs reports? And how would a relatively weak jobs report in September affect\nyour plans? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So, you’re right, we have a—really, I’ll call it a unique situation\nwhere, by many measures, the labor market is tight. And 11 million job openings, very\nwidespread reports from employers all over the economy saying it’s quite difficult to hire people,\nwages moving up, and that kind—so, quite a tight labor market. So our view, I think—\nwidespread view a few months ago was that several things were coming together in the fall,\nincluding kids back to school, which would, you know, which would lighten caregiving duties,\nincluding the expiration of unemployment—extra unemployment benefits, and other things\nwould come together to provide an increase in labor supply, and so we’d get out of this strange\nworld where there’re lots of unemployed people and a high unemployment rate but a labor\nshortage.\nPage 12 of 27\nSeptember 22, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nAnd so what happened was, Delta happened. And you had this very sharp spike in Delta\ncases. And I think, so that affects—for example, when schools are open 60 percent of the time\nor when they’re always at a threat of being closed because of Delta, the Delta variant, you know,\nyou might want to wait. Rather than going ahead and taking a job and starting work only to have\nto quit it three weeks later, you’re going to wait until you’re confident of that. So some of that\nmay not have happened. Also, people didn’t, you know—as you know, hiring and spending in\nthese face-to-face service industries, travel and leisure, it just kind of stopped during those\nmonths. So we—so that—really, the big shortfall in labor, in jobs, was largely in travel and\nleisure, and that’s because of—clearly because of Delta. So that all happened. And so what\nwe—we know things that didn’t happen.\nI think there’s still—it may just be that it’s going to take more time. But it still seems\nthat, inexorably, people will—these are people who were largely working back in February of\n2020. They’ll get back to work when it’s time to do that. It just may take a longer time. You’re\nright, though—it didn’t happen with any force in September, and a lot of that was Delta.\nIn terms of the—you asked also about the test for November. I think if the economy\ncontinues to progress broadly in line with expectations, then I think—and also the overall\nsituation is appropriate for this, then I think we could easily move ahead at the next meeting. Or\nnot, depending on whether we feel like that, those tests are met.\nCHRIS RUGABER. Well, just a quick—if I could just quickly follow up, I mean, what,\nhow much of that will depend on what kind of jobs report we get for September? And, I mean, is\nit, you know, are you in a data-dependent phase here where you need to see certain numbers\ngoing ahead? Or are we at a point where you’ve accumulated enough progress that—\nPage 13 of 27\nSeptember 22, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. So it is, it’s accumulated progress. So, you know, for me, it wouldn’t\ntake a knockout, great, super strong employment report. It would take a reasonably good\nemployment report for me to feel like that test is met. And others on the Committee—many on\nthe Committee feel that the test is already met. Others want to see more progress. And, you\nknow, we’ll work it out as we go. But I would say that, in my own thinking, the test is all but\nmet. So I don’t personally need to see a very strong employment report, but I’d like to see a\ngood—a decent employment report. I mean, it’s not, it’s, again, it’s not to be confused with the\ntest for liftoff, which is so much higher.\nCHRIS RUGABER. Great. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Okay. Thank you. We’ll go to Victoria Guida.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Chair Powell. So I wanted to ask about the Vice Chair of\nSupervision position and just—I was wondering if you could speak about how you view that role\nand the extent to which you defer to that person on regulatory policy. And then, just sort of a\nrelated question: As you know, Randy Quarles’s vice chairmanship ends next month, and I was\nwondering if he’s going to retain the supervisory portfolio until he’s replaced in that role.\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So Dodd-Frank created this position, Vice Chair for\nSupervision, and it’s, there’s actually a specific assignment in the Dodd-Frank language, as I’m\nsure you know. And, effectively, what it means is that the Vice Chair for Supervision is charged\nwith setting the regulatory agenda. And, you know, it’s a specific grant of authority. And in the\n10 years, almost, that I’ve been at the Fed, that person has really done that. Dan Tarullo\ncertainly did it, and Vice Chair Quarles did it as well. And I would, I think—I respect that\nauthority. I respect that that’s the person who will set the regulatory agenda going forward, and I\nwould accept that.\nPage 14 of 27\nSeptember 22, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nAnd, furthermore, you know, it’s fully appropriate to look at—for a new person to come\nin and look at the current state of regulation and supervision and suggest appropriate changes,\nand I welcome that. In terms of Vice Chair Quarles’s term, we’re not currently in that situation,\nand I actually don’t have any updates for you on that today. We’ll keep you posted on that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We’ll go to Steve Matthews at Bloomberg.\nSTEVE MATTHEWS. Thank you. Chair Powell, I wanted to ask about the inclusive\nmonetary policy framework. In particular, Bloomberg surveyed economists, and we found that\nthey predict liftoff will happen when the U.S. unemployment rate is 3.8 percent but the Black\nunemployment rate is 6.1 percent. And I’m wondering if a 6.1 percent unemployment rate for\nAfrican Americans is consistent with full employment or whether it would need to be lower as\npart of your inclusive growth strategy.\nCHAIR POWELL. Right, so the point of the broad and inclusive goal was not to target a\nparticular unemployment rate for any particular group. Really, we look at a broad range of—a\nvery broad range of metrics when we think about what maximum employment is. And one of\nthe things we look at is unemployment rates and participation rates and wages for different\ndemographic and age groups and that kind of thing. So we will do all of that. So I think if you\nlook back, what were we really thinking? So we all saw the benefits of a strong labor market. If\nyou look at the last two or three years of, before the pandemic hit, you saw—after a lot of long\nprogress, you saw a really strong labor market. And you saw wages at the low end moving up\nfaster than everywhere else—something that’s great to see.\nWe also saw the lowest unemployment rates for minorities of various, you know, for\nAfrican Americans, for example, and also participation rates. We saw a really, really healthy set\nof dynamics. And, by the way, we also—there was no reason why it couldn’t continue. There\nPage 15 of 27\nSeptember 22, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nwere no imbalances in the economy, and then along came the pandemic. We were not—there\nwas nothing in the economy that looked like a buildup of imbalances that could cause a\nrecession. So I was very much thinking that the country would really benefit from a few more\nyears of this. It would have been—so we’re all quite eager to get back to that.\nWe also said we wouldn’t raise rates just in response to very low unemployment, in the\nabsence of inflation. So that was another aspect of it, because we saw that that really benefited\nlabor market participants in a broad and inclusive way. That’s, of course, not the current\nsituation. We have significant slack in the economy and inflation well above target, not\nmoderately above target. So that’s, really, how we think about it. It isn’t really just targeting the\nheadline numbers, but it’s about taking all of those things into account in your thinking about\nwhat constitutes maximum employment.\nSTEVE MATTHEWS. Just to follow up, should there be a significant gap between\nBlack unemployment and overall unemployment for structural reasons that are outside of the\ncontrol of the Fed that other people should be doing something about? Or should that be—\nshould the gap be narrowed, if not down to zero?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, you really—I mean, first of all, ideally, there wouldn’t be any\ngap, of course. We would all love to see no such gap. This is a persistent gap, and it’s very hard\nto explain based on typical metrics. It’s just, it’s quite troubling, but it really is—you know, we\nhave, you know, famously broad and blunt tools. I think eliminating inequality and racial\ndiscrimination and racial disparities and that kind of thing is really something that fiscal policy\nand other policies—frankly, education policies and that kind of thing—are better at focusing on.\nI think we’ve identified the part that we can do, and we’ll do that part. But I’ve always been\nclear that it’s going to take policies broadly across society to work on these problems.\nPage 16 of 27\nSeptember 22, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nSTEVE MATTHEWS. Thanks.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let’s go to Michael McKee.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. —a plan for dealing with a debt default that included\nprioritization, that included changes in bank regulations and possibly selling defaulted—or,\nnondefaulted Treasuries and buying those who are—that are. Are any or all of those still on the\ntable? Do you think any of those would work? And what would happen to the economy, in your\nview, should the debt ceiling not be raised?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, I missed the first few words, but I think I got your question. So\nit’s just very important that the debt ceiling be raised in a timely fashion so that the United States\ncan pay its bills when and as they come due. That’s a critically important thing. The failure to\ndo that is something that could result in severe reactions, severe damage to the economy and to\nthe financial markets. And it’s just not something that we could contemplate, that we should\ncontemplate. I’m not going to comment on particular tactics or things like that. I’m just going to\nsay that I think we can all agree that the United States shouldn’t default on any of its\nobligations—should pay them when and as due. And that, you know, no one should assume that\nthe Fed or anyone else can protect the markets or the economy in the event of a failure—fully\nprotect in the event of a failure to, you know, to make sure that we do pay those debts when\nthey’re due.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Good. If I could follow up, have you discussed options with\nmembers of Congress?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, I don’t generally ever talk about the conversations I have\nwith elected officials or other appointed officials. But, look, you can see that this is a major\nfocus among those who have responsibility for it, and—including elected people.\nPage 17 of 27\nSeptember 22, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let’s go to Hannah Lang.\nHANNAH LANG. Hi—thanks so much. Senator Warren sent you a letter last week\nurging the Fed to break up Wells Fargo, citing what she called “ungovernable behavior” from the\nbank. I’m just curious, under what circumstances would the Fed actually consider revoking a\nfinancial holding company’s license? And if the indiscretions at Wells Fargo, in your opinion,\nwarrant such an action?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we’re, of course, very closely monitoring Wells Fargo’s efforts to\nfix its widespread and pervasive problems. They represent a serious matter to us, and the firm is\nrequired to remediate them. And we will take appropriate supervisory action if the firm fails to\nmeet our expectation. We continue to hold the firm accountable for its deficiencies with an\nunprecedented asset cap that will stay in place until the firm has comprehensively fixed its\nproblems. And we’re not going to remove that asset cap until that’s done. So bottom line is,\nwe’ll take strong supervisory action if a firm is engaging in unsafe and unsound practices or\nviolating laws. But I can’t speak to our confidential supervisory assessments of any\nindividual bank.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Now we’ll go to Michael Derby.\nMICHAEL DERBY. Thank you for taking my question. You noted earlier in the press\nconference that you weren’t aware of the trading activity of the Boston and Dallas Fed Bank\npresidents. As you know, those, all 12 regional Fed Bank presidents just went through the\nrenomination process earlier this year. And Governor Brainard described it as a rigorous process\nat the time. So I want to know, did anybody know—did anybody at the Board level know about\nthe stock trading activity? And, going forward, do you still have confidence in the Dallas and\nBoston Fed Bank presidents to do their job?\nPage 18 of 27\nSeptember 22, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. So these, I don’t need to tell you, we file, people file these reports\nannually. And I think they were just quite recently filed for 2020. So I don’t have any reason to\nthink people at the Board would have known about particular trading that’s going on. They will\nsee that—there are people at the Fed who see the, you know, see the trading reports when\nthey’re, you know, when they’re annually filed.\nYou know, in terms of having confidence and that sort of thing, I think no one is happy,\nno one on the FOMC is happy to be in this situation, to be having these questions raised. It’s\nsomething we take very, very seriously. This is an important moment for the Fed, and I’m\ndetermined that we will rise to the moment and handle it in ways that will stand up over time.\nI’m very reluctant to get ahead of the process and speculate, though, about different things. And,\nyou know, when we have things to announce, we’ll go ahead and do that, but that’s really what I\nhave for today.\nMICHAEL DERBY. One small follow-up. I mean, I know that you didn’t have the\n2020 forms in hand, but you would have had past-year forms in hand. And at least in the case of,\nlike, the Dallas disclosure forms, similar trading activity was shown in years past. So that, in\ntheory, could have been something that came up in the renomination process.\nCHAIR POWELL. So that’s, yeah, that’s a good question. So, you know, the five-year\nreview that we do under this unusual provision of law where all of the Reserve Bank presidents\nare reviewed for reappointment at the same time every five years, that is really a broad review\nabout their leadership of the institution, their performance on the FOMC, all of those things.\nAnd if there were a concern—a public concern or a private concern—about something that\nsomeone had done, we wouldn’t wait for the five-year. We wouldn’t wait that day if there were\nconcerns.\nPage 19 of 27\nSeptember 22, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nYou’re right, though, these—as I mentioned, we have had a framework for a long time,\nand it’s similar to what other government agencies have, only it’s a little stricter. And it is that\nyou can trade financial instruments, but not specific ones like bank debt. You can’t trade during\nthe FOMC period and during the meeting—the blackout period and then during the meeting.\nAnd then you disclose all this, and we have disclosed it for years. So all of these things have\nbeen going—to the extent they’ve been going on, they’ve been a matter of public record.\nAnd, you know—but, nonetheless—so that—you know, it was seeming to work just\nokay. And now you look at it, and you see this, and you think, “We need to do better.” And we\nwill. But you’re right, but it has not been part of the process. And, appropriately, I don’t think it\nshould have been. I mean, I wouldn’t blame the people who conduct that review. I really think,\nif someone had raised concerns or if we’d had concerns, then it would have been, but it wouldn’t\nhave been part of that process. It would have been raised instantly, rather than once every five\nyears.\nMICHAEL DERBY. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let’s go to Jean Yung.\nJEAN YUNG. Thank you, Michelle. Chair Powell, I wanted to ask about how the Fed\nwould balance the two parts of its dual mandate if inflation stays elevated but we still have a\nlabor shortage and participation remains lower than ideal. Would you hold off on raising rates?\nOr how would you think about that? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, let me say one thing. You’re looking for conditions consistent\nwith maximum employment to lift off, and those conditions can change over time. So you’re not\nnecessarily bound by a particular level of the unemployment rate or the participation rate or\nanything else like that, which can change over time. But more to your point, really, we actually\nPage 20 of 27\nSeptember 22, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nhave a paragraph in our framework, and something like this has been there for a long time. It’s, I\nthink it’s paragraph six. And you’re talking about a situation in which the two goals are not\ncomplementary; they’re somehow in tension. And if we judge that’s effect—that is the case,\nwhat it says is, we take into account the employment shortfalls and inflation deviations and the\npotentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return\nto levels judged consistent with the mandate.\nSo, we used to call that the balanced-approach paragraph because it had those words. So\nit’s a very difficult situation for any central bank to be—pardon me—to be in a situation where\nthe two goals are in tension. And that paragraph tries to address it by saying we would sort of\nweigh the equities between the two. How long will it take, and how big are the gaps, and that\nkind of thing. We don’t really think we’re in that—we’re sort of in that situation, I’d say, in a\nshort-term way. But we think, we do expect that this is sort of—because of the COVID shock\nand the reopening and all that, you’re seeing this temporarily.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Great. Thank you. We’ll go to Edward Lawrence.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you, Michelle. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking\nthe question. So on corporate debt, what happened with Evergrande that we’ve been watching,\ncould that be—is that a preview of what could happen with the amount of corporate debt that’s\nout there? In the past you’ve said you’re watching the level of corporate debt. So is, what’s\nyour level of concern right now? And would you consider the Evergrande Group issue sort of a\nwarning signal?\nCHAIR POWELL. About the United States, no. Corporate defaults are very low in the\nUnited States right now. Corporate leverage built up over the course of the long expansion that\nended with the pandemic. We were very concerned in the last year or so. We were concerned in\nPage 21 of 27\nSeptember 22, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthe last year or so, and then I’d say very concerned at the beginning of the pandemic that, if\nyou’ve got a highly leveraged company and your revenue stops for an uncertain period, as things\nhappened at the beginning of the crisis, we were very concerned that there would be a wave of\ndefaults. It didn’t happen, potentially—I mean, to a significant extent because of the CARES\nAct and the response that we undertook and all that. It was a, you know, a much stronger\nresponse than we’ve ever had. And I think for whatever reason now, you have very, very low\ndefault rates now among corporate debt.\nYou know, the Evergrande situation seems very particular to China, which has very high\ndebt for an emerging market economy, really the highest that any emerging market economy has\nhad. And the government has been working to get that under control. This is part of that effort.\nThe government put new strictures in place for highly leveraged companies. And Evergrande is\ndealing with those strictures, and it’s something they’re managing. In terms of the implications\nfor us, there isn’t, there’s not a lot of direct United States exposure. The big Chinese banks are\nnot tremendously exposed. But, you know, you would worry that it would affect global financial\nconditions through confidence channels and that kind of thing. But I wouldn’t draw a parallel to\nthe United States corporate sector.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We’ll go to Brian Cheung.\nBRIAN CHEUNG. Hi, Chairman Powell. Just wondering if you could give us an update\non whether or not you’ve had conversations with the White House about a possible\nreappointment. And then whether or not you would like to be reappointed as this chatter kind of\nbuilds up. Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. I think the phrase goes: “I have nothing for you on that today.”\nSorry. I’m focused on doing my job—\nPage 22 of 27\nSeptember 22, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Greg Robb.\nCHAIR POWELL. —I’m focused on doing my job every day for the American people,\nand I don’t have any comment on that, Brian.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Sorry about that. Let’s go to Greg Robb.\nGREG ROBB. Thanks. Thanks for taking my question, Chair Powell. I was wondering\nif, in your discussion about the tapering that—you said that officials think it’s appropriate to end\naround the middle of the year—if there was any discussion about what happens to the balance\nsheet then. I’ve heard some Fed officials say that they wouldn’t shrink the balance sheet. Was\nthat discussed? And what’s your stance on shrinking the balance sheet? Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. So my thinking on this has been: Let’s get through the taper\ndecision, and then let’s turn to those issues. There are a number of related issues that—you\nmentioned one, Greg, but, you know, and—which you need to start to think about, and we’ll do\nthat. But I want to get, we want to get through this taper decision, and then turn to those issues,\nrather than start, you know, thinking about them now and having the minutes discuss them and\nget people thinking that we are, you know, focused on those issues, because we’re really not.\nAnd, you know, we do have the experience of what we did last time. We’ve watched other\ncountries and what they’ve done. So I think we’ll be able to get to sensible decisions fairly\nexpeditiously when it’s time. But it’s just not time yet, in my thinking.\nGREG ROBB. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let’s go to Scott Horsley.\nSCOTT HORSLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You talked a little bit about inflation\nexpectations. And there does seem to be something of a divide between market expectations and\nthe views of professional economists—which are pretty much in line with the FOMC\nPage 23 of 27\nSeptember 22, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nmembers—and laypeople’s expectations, at least as reflected in the recent New York Fed survey.\nHow much weight do you put on laypeople’s expectations? And what do you think accounts for\nthat divide?\nCHAIR POWELL. So within—let’s just take the household surveys generally. The New\nYork Fed survey, let me talk about that specifically, and this is from the New York Fed. It’s\nonly an eight-year-old survey, and it does seem as though the, they’re looking three years out.\nAnd it seems like there’s a high correlation between three-year and one-year. For the most part,\nsurveys are showing that households expect higher inflation in the near term but not in the longer\nterm. And that’s also what expectations are showing.\nSo there are many, many different inflation measures, of course. And that’s why we have\nthis thing called the CIE, which is the, it’s an index of—it’s market-based measures, it’s\nprofessional forecasters, and it’s household surveys. And you just put them all—it’s not, you\nknow, it doesn’t have a lot of grand theory about it. You put them all in, and you measure the\nchange. So you should be—and, also, you measure things like the dispersion and that sort of\nthing, so you can look at all that. And, you know, it tells a story of inflation expectations moving\nup. Many of the different measures will also show inflation expectations moving back up to\nwhere they were in, say, 2013, which was before the really—the drop in inflation expectations\nbroadly happened in ’14 and ’15—around then. So that’s not a troubling thing.\nBut, you know, inflation expectations are terribly important. We spend a lot of time\nwatching them. And if we did see them moving up in a troubling way and running persistently\nabove levels that are really consistent with our mandate, then, you know, we would certainly\nreact to that. But we don’t really see that now. We see more of a moderate increase that is—the\nPage 24 of 27\nSeptember 22, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nfirst part of which is welcome. And because, you know, inflation expectations had drifted down,\nand it was good to see them get back up a bit. But, again, we watch carefully.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let’s go to Heather Scott.\nHEATHER SCOTT. Hi. Sorry, you caught me off guard. Thank you, Chair Powell, for\ntaking my question. I really appreciate it. Again, on the taper timing. You say it’s going to last\nto the middle of next year. But with your concerns about the potential for upside risks to\ninflation, would you think you might need to have liftoff happen before you finish the tapering?\nCHAIR POWELL. That’s not my expectation. Of course, we can always—we haven’t\ndecided to taper yet, and we haven’t decided the pace yet. So, you know, it’s not my expectation\nthat we would have to. We can certainly speed up or slow down the taper if we—if it becomes\nappropriate, though. Absolutely. In fact, back in ’13, when we tapered, we always said we\nweren’t on a preset course. I think this will be a shorter period. The economy’s much farther\nalong than it was when we tapered in 2013. So it makes sense to allow the runoff to happen. It’s\na very gradual taper. It will be when we agree on it. And, but we certainly have the freedom to\neither speed it up or slow it down if that becomes appropriate.\nHEATHER SCOTT. But you wouldn’t expect rate liftoff to happen until you’re finished\nwith that process?\nCHAIR POWELL. You wouldn’t, no, because, you know, when you’re—as long as\nyou’re buying assets, you’re adding accommodation, and it wouldn’t make any sense to, you\nknow, then lift off. I mean, what you would do is, you’d speed up the taper, I think, if that were\nthe situation you’re in. Not—we don’t expect to be in that situation, but I do think it would be\nwiser at that point to go ahead and speed up the taper, just because the two are then working in\nthe same direction.\nPage 25 of 27\nSeptember 22, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nHEATHER SCOTT. All right, thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Okay, for the last question, we’ll go to Jeff Cox.\nJEFF COX. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking the question. I just wanted to check in\nwith you to see if you have an update at all on the efforts from the Fed to develop a central bank\ndigital currency. I believe that the report was supposed to come this summer, and indications\nthat it’s going to come this month. But the drumbeat seems to be kind of getting louder to see\nwhere the Fed’s heading on this, and just wondering if you can provide some update there.\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure, I’d be glad to. So we think it’s really important that the central\nbank maintain a stable currency and payment system for the public’s benefit. That’s one of our\njobs. We also live in a time of transformational innovation around digital payments, and we\nneed to make sure that the Fed is able to continue to deliver to the public a stable and trustworthy\ncurrency and payment system. So there’s extensive private innovation, a lot of which is taking\nplace outside the regulatory perimeter. And innovation is fantastic. Our economy runs on\ninnovation. But where the public’s money is concerned, we need to make sure that appropriate\nregulatory protections are in place, and today they really are not in some cases.\nSo with that in mind and with the creation of myriad private currencies and currency-like\nproducts, we’re working proactively to evaluate whether to issue a CBDC and, if so, in what\nform. We have two broad workstreams, one of which is really technology, both at the Board and\nin the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s work with MIT—the other of which is to identify,\nscope out, deal with, analyze the various public policy issues. As you mentioned, we do intend\nto publish a discussion paper soon that will be the basis for a period of public engagement—\nengagement with many different groups, including elected officials, around these issues. We\nPage 26 of 27\nSeptember 22, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthink it’s our obligation to do the work, both on technology and public policy, to form a basis for\nmaking an informed decision.\nThe ultimate test we’ll apply when assessing a central bank digital currency and other\ndigital innovations is: Are there clear and tangible benefits that outweigh any costs and risks?\nWe’re also, as you know, investing heavily right now in building a new settlement system for\ninstant payments in the U.S. It’ll be the first such major expansion of our core payment system\nsince the 1970s. We found the case for this quite compelling—for consumers, businesses, and\njust ensuring that all financial institutions have access to that payment system. So, bottom line,\nwe haven’t made a decision about the CBDC, but we will be issuing a discussion paper soon in\norder to form the basis of this public interaction that we’ll have. Thank you very much.\nJEFF COX. If I could have a quick—could I get a quick follow on that? Thank you. I\nwas just wondering if—okay—are you concerned at all with kind of falling behind in the global\nrace for digital currencies?\nCHAIR POWELL. I think it’s important that we get to a place where we can make an\ninformed decision about this and do so expeditiously. I don’t think we’re behind. I think it’s\nmore important to do this right than to do it fast. We are the world’s reserve currency. And I\nthink we’re in a good place to make that analysis and make that decision—by the way, which\nwill be a governmentwide decision. We would do this, we would have to have a meeting of the\nminds with the Administration and also probably with Congress. We would really like to have\nbroad support for this. It’s a very important innovation. And I think we would need that to go\nahead, and that’s the process we’re engaged in. Thanks very much.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you.\nPage 27 of 27"

The sectors most adversely\naffected by the pandemic have improved in recent months, but the summer’s rise in\nCOVID-19 cases has slowed their recovery. Inflation is elevated, largely reflecting\nfactors that are expected to be transitory. Supply and demand imbalances related to\nthe pandemic and the reopening of the economy have contributed to sizable price\nincreases in some sectors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in\npart reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S.\nhouseholds and businesses.\nThe path of the economy continues to depend on the course of the virus. Progress\non vaccinations and an easing of supply constraints are expected to support continued\ngains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation. Risks\nto the economic outlook remain.\nThe Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate\nof 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation having run persistently below this\nlonger-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above\n2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer term\ninflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. The Committee expects to\n‑\nmaintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are\nachieved. The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate\n(more)\nFor release at 2 p.m. EDT November 3, 2021\n-2-\nat 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until\nlabor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s\nassessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on\ntrack to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In light of the substantial further\nprogress the economy has made toward the Committee’s goals since last December,\nthe Committee decided to begin reducing the monthly pace of its net asset purchases\nby $10 billion for Treasury securities and $5 billion for agency mortgage-backed\nsecurities. Beginning later this month, the Committee will increase its holdings of\nTreasury securities by at least $70 billion per month and of agency mortgage backed\nsecurities by at least $35 billion per month. Beginning in December, the Committee\n‑\nwill increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $60 billion per month and\nof agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $30 billion per month. The\nCommittee judges that similar reductions in the pace of net asset purchases will likely\nbe appropriate each month, but it is prepared to adjust the pace of purchases if\nwarranted by changes in the economic outlook. The Federal Reserve’s ongoing\npurchases and holdings of securities will continue to foster smooth market\nfunctioning and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of\ncredit to households and businesses.\nIn assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will\ncontinue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic\noutlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy\nas appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s\ngoals.

    "press_conf": "November 3, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nTranscript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference\nNovember 3, 2021\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed\nto achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and\nprice stability.\nToday, the FOMC kept interest rates near zero and, in light of the progress the economy\nhas made toward our goals, decided to begin reducing the pace of asset purchases. With these\nactions, monetary policy will continue to provide strong support to the economic recovery.\nGiven the unprecedented nature of the disruptions related to the pandemic and the reopening of\nthe economy, we remain attentive to risks and will ensure that our policy is well positioned to\naddress the full range of plausible economic outcomes. I will say more about our monetary\npolicy decisions after reviewing recent economic developments.\nEconomic activity expanded at a 6.5 percent pace in the first half of the year, reflecting\nprogress on vaccinations, the reopening of the economy, and strong policy support. In the third\nquarter, real GDP growth slowed notably from this rapid pace. The summer’s surge in COVID\ncases from the Delta variant has held back the recovery in the sectors most adversely affected by\nthe pandemic, including travel and leisure. Activity has also been restrained by supply\nconstraints and bottlenecks, notably in the motor vehicle industry. As a result, both household\nspending and business investment flattened out last quarter. Nonetheless, aggregate demand has\nbeen very strong this year, buoyed by fiscal and monetary policy support and the healthy\nfinancial positions of households and businesses. With COVID case counts receding further and\nprogress on vaccinations, economic growth should pick up this quarter, resulting in strong\ngrowth for the year as a whole.\nPage 1 of 29\nNovember 3, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nConditions in the labor market have continued to improve, and demand for workers\nremains very strong. As with overall economic activity, the pace of improvement slowed with\nthe rise in COVID cases. In August and September, job gains averaged 280,000 per month,\ndown from an average of about 1 million jobs per month in June and July. The slowdown has\nbeen concentrated in sectors most sensitive to the pandemic, including leisure and hospitality and\neducation.\nThe unemployment rate was 4.8 percent in September. This figure understates the\nshortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market remains subdued. Some\nof the softness in participation likely reflects the aging of the population and retirements. But\nparticipation for prime-aged individuals also remains well below pre-pandemic levels—in part\nreflecting factors related to the pandemic, such as caregiving needs and ongoing concerns about\nthe virus. As a result, employers are having difficulties filling job openings. These impediments\nto labor supply should diminish with further progress on containing the virus—supporting gains\nin employment and economic activity.\nThe economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to\nshoulder the burden have been hardest hit. Despite progress, joblessness continues to fall\ndisproportionately on African Americans and Hispanics.\nThe supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the\neconomy have contributed to sizable price increases in some sectors. In particular, bottlenecks\nand supply chain disruptions are limiting how quickly production can respond to the rebound in\ndemand in the near term. As a result, overall inflation is running well above our 2 percent\nlonger-run goal. Supply constraints have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated.\nNonetheless, it remains the case that the drivers of higher inflation have been predominantly\nPage 2 of 29\nNovember 3, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nconnected to the dislocations caused by the pandemic—specifically, the effects on supply and\ndemand from the shutdown, the uneven reopening, and the ongoing effects of the virus itself.\nWe understand the difficulties that high inflation poses for individuals and families,\nparticularly those with limited means to absorb higher prices for essentials such as food and\ntransportation. Our tools cannot ease supply constraints. Like most forecasters, we continue to\nbelieve that our dynamic economy will adjust to the supply and demand imbalances and that, as\nit does, inflation will decline to levels much closer to our 2 percent longer-run goal. Of course, it\nis very difficult to predict the persistence of supply constraints or their effects on inflation.\nGlobal supply chains are complex; they will return to normal function, but the timing of that is\nhighly uncertain.\nWe are committed to our longer-run goal of 2 percent inflation and to having longer-term\ninflation expectations well anchored at this goal. If we were to see signs that the path of\ninflation, or [of] longer-term inflation expectations, was moving materially and persistently\nbeyond levels consistent with our goal, we would use our tools to preserve price stability. We\nwill be watching carefully to see whether the economy is evolving in line with expectations.\nThe Fed’s policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to\npromote the stability of the financial system. Our asset purchases have been a critical tool. They\nhelped preserve financial stability early in the pandemic and since then have helped foster\nsmooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions to support the economy.\nLast December, the Committee stated its intention to continue asset purchases at a pace\nof at least $120 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our\nPage 3 of 29\nNovember 3, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nmaximum-employment and price-stability goals. At today’s meeting, the Committee judged that\nthe economy has met this test, and decided to begin reducing the pace of its asset purchases.\nBeginning later this month, we will reduce the monthly pace of our net asset purchases by\n$10 billion for Treasury securities and $5 billion for agency mortgage-backed securities. We\nalso announced another reduction of this size in the monthly purchase pace starting in mid-\nDecember, since that month’s purchase schedule will be released by the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York prior to our December FOMC meeting. If the economy evolves broadly as expected,\nwe judge that similar reductions in the pace of net asset purchases will likely be appropriate each\nmonth, implying that increases in our securities holdings would cease by the middle of next year.\nThat said, we are prepared to adjust the pace of purchases if warranted by changes in the\neconomic outlook. And even after our balance sheet stops expanding, our holdings of securities\nwill continue to support accommodative financial conditions.\nOur decision today to begin tapering our asset purchases does not imply any direct signal\nregarding our interest rate policy. We continue to articulate a different and more stringent test\nfor the economic conditions that would need to be met before raising the federal funds rate.\nTo conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses\nacross the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do\neverything we can to complete the recovery in employment and achieve our price-stability goal.\nThank you. I look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We’ll go to Nick at the Wall Street Journal.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Hi. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, the\nmarkets anticipate you will raise rates once or twice next year. Are they wrong?\nPage 4 of 29\nNovember 3, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. So I would say it this way. We try to focus on what we can\ncontrol—and that is how to communicate as clearly as possible, in this highly uncertain world,\nhow we’re thinking about the economic outlook and the balance of risks and how policy will\nevolve in that case and also in the cases, which are frequent, where the economy evolves in\nunexpected ways. So the focus at this meeting is on tapering asset purchases, not on raising\nrates.\nIt is time to taper, we think, because the economy has achieved substantial further\nprogress toward our goals, measured from last December. We don’t think it’s time yet to raise\ninterest rates. There is still ground to cover to reach maximum employment, both in terms of\nemployment and in terms of participation.\nGetting to your question, our baseline expectation is that supply bottlenecks and\nshortages will persist well into next year, and elevated inflation as well, and that, as the\npandemic subsides, supply chain bottlenecks will abate—and job growth will move back up.\nAnd as that happens, inflation will decline from today’s elevated levels. Of course, the timing of\nthat is highly uncertain. But, certainly, we should see inflation moving down by the second or\nthird quarter. The time for lifting rates and beginning to remove accommodation will depend on\nthe path of the economy.\nWe think we can be patient. If a response is called for, we will not hesitate. So, what I\nwill tell you is, we will be watching carefully to see whether the economy evolves in line with\nour expectations, and policy will adapt appropriately. And that’s what I would say.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Based on—if I could follow up, based on your current outlook for\nthe labor market, do you think it’s possible—or likely, even—that maximum employment could\nbe achieved by the second half of next year?\nPage 5 of 29\nNovember 3, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. So if you look at the progress that we’ve made over the course of the\nlast year, if that pace were to continue, then the answer would be: “Yes, I do think that that is\npossible.” Of course, we measure maximum employment based on a wide range of figures, but\nit’s certainly within the realm of possibility.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Next, we’ll go to Jeanna at the New York Times.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Chair Powell. I was wondering if you could detail a little bit\nhow you’re thinking about wages at this moment. Obviously, we’re seeing strong wage growth,\nparticularly for people in sort of lower-income fields. I wonder if you see that as a positive thing\nor as a potential start to a wage–price spiral and sort of how you sort of delineate those two\nthings.\nCHAIR POWELL. So wages have been moving up strongly, very strongly. And, in\nparticular, I would point to the employment compensation index reading that we got last Friday.\nNow, in real terms, they’ve been—they had been running a little bit below inflation, so real\nwages were not really increasing. I think, with the ECI reading, it becomes close to maybe not\nincreasing, but close to back to zero in terms of the real increase. So wages moving up, of\ncourse, is how standard of living increases over the years for generation upon generation. It’s\nvery important, and it’s generally a good thing. You know, the concern is a somewhat unusual\ncase where, if wages were to be rising persistently and materially above inflation and\nproductivity gains, that could put upward pressure on, or downward pressure on margins and\ncause companies to—or employers, really—to raise prices as a result, and you can see yourself,\nfind yourself in what we used to call a wage–price spiral. We don’t have evidence of that yet.\nProductivity has been very high. The ECI reading is just one reading. Again, if you look back,\nPage 6 of 29\nNovember 3, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nwe—so we’ll be watching this carefully. But I would say that, at this point, we don’t see\ntroubling increases in wages. And we don’t expect those to emerge, but we’ll be watching\ncarefully.\nJOE PAVEL. Next, we’ll go to Steve Liesman from CNBC.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I wonder if you could perhaps give us\nyour thinking about the tradeoffs between inflation and unemployment. You talked about the\nshortfall of unemployment—reemployment relative to before the pandemic, and yet you have\ninflation, which is affecting everybody. Are we at, or close to, a point where the risk of inflation\nis greater than the benefit that you’d—for recovering these lost jobs so that now, from a risk-\nmanagement standpoint, it makes sense to move more aggressively on rate hikes? And kind of a\nrelated question: The statement today says you’ll keep policy accommodative until you hit that\n2 percent inflation target. Our surveys show looking for 5 percent inflation this year, 3½ percent\nnext year—it sure seems like you’re on track to modestly or moderately exceed that 2 percent\ntarget. Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes. So I’m not sure I totally got your first question, but I would\nsay—in fact, could you just quickly, succinctly, say your first question again?\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Sure. The idea that the tradeoff between inflation and\nunemployment, that you would keep policy accommodative to put this 5 million folks, or find\nthese 5 million jobs again, at the same time all Americans will be suffering from higher\ninflation—is that tradeoff worth it, or is it better or smarter to raise rates right now to combat\ninflation and perhaps not lean so heavily on the employment side of the mandate?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes, so, you know, this isn’t the traditional Phillips curve situation\nwhere there’s a direct tradeoff, where that’s really what we’re talking about. The inflation that\nPage 7 of 29\nNovember 3, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nwe’re seeing is really not due to a tight labor market. It’s due to bottlenecks, and it’s due to\nshortages, and it’s due to very strong demand meeting those. So I think it’s not the classical\nsituation where you have that precise tradeoff.\nBut, you know, in this situation, we do have a provision in our Statement on Longer-Run\nGoals, as you know, that says when those two things are in tension, what we do is, we take into\naccount the employment shortfalls and inflation deviations and the potentially different time\nhorizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent\nwith the mandate. So we used to call that the “balanced approach” paragraph. We have to think\nabout the amount of the deviation, we have to think about the time it will take, and we have to\nmake policy in a world where the two goals are in tension. It’s very difficult.\nBut what it really boils down to is something that’s common sense. And that is risk\nmanagement. We have to be aware of the risks that we’re—particularly now the risk of\nsignificantly higher inflation. We see shortages and bottlenecks persisting into next year, well\ninto next year. We see higher inflation persisting, and we have to be in position to address that\nrisk should it become really a threat to—should it create a threat of more persistent, longer-term\ninflation. And that’s what we think our policy is doing now. It’s putting us in a position to be\nable to address the range of plausible outcomes.\nJOE PAVEL. Thank you. Next, we’ll go to Colby Smith at the Financial Times.\nCOLBY SMITH. Thank you. Chair Powell, what are the economic conditions that\nwould perhaps warrant a faster pace of tapering? And I’m wondering how you would also\ncharacterize the risks that the Fed may actually need to accelerate that process eventually.\nThank you.\nPage 8 of 29\nNovember 3, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. So I guess, as I said in my opening remarks, assuming the economy\nperforms broadly as expected, the Committee judges that similar reductions in the pace of net\nasset purchases will likely be appropriate each month, and we’re prepared to deviate from that\npath if warranted by changes in the economic outlook.\nSo I’m not going to give you a lot more detail on what that might be. Of course, if we do\nsee something like that happening, if it becomes a question, then we’ll communicate very\ntransparently and openly about that. But I’m just going to leave it with the words that are in the\nstatement. Sorry, was there a second part?\nCOLBY SMITH. Yes. It’s just on characterizing the risks that you might actually have\nto do so later on.\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, I would just leave you with the words we have here. We\nare prepared to speed up or slow down the pace of reductions in asset purchases if it’s warranted\nby changes in the economic outlook. And, again, if we feel like something like that’s happening,\nthen we’ll be very transparent about it. We wouldn’t want to surprise markets. We’ll say, in\nlight of this factor or these factors, we are considering doing this, and then we would either do it\nor not do it. But so—but I’m not going to, you know, start making up examples of what that\nmight be today. Thanks.\nCOLBY SMITH. Thank you.\nJOE PAVEL. Thank you. Next one, Rachel Siegel at the Washington Post.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you so much for taking our questions.\nYou mentioned at the beginning that the Fed understands the difficulties that high inflation poses\nfor individuals and families, especially those with limited means. What is your message to those\nPage 9 of 29\nNovember 3, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nfamilies or consumers that are struggling with higher prices right now, and do you feel that your\nexpectations around transitory inflation, that message is reaching them? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes. So, first of all, it is our job to—and we accept responsibility\nand accountability for inflation in the medium term. We’re accountable to Congress and to the\nAmerican people for maximum employment and price stability. The level of inflation we have\nright now is not at all consistent with price stability. By the way, we’re also not at maximum\nemployment, as I mentioned. So I would want to assure people that we will use our tools as\nappropriate to get inflation under control.\nWe don’t think it’s a good time to raise interest rates, though, because we want to see the\nlabor market heal further. And we have very good reason to think that that will happen as the\nDelta variant declines, so—which it’s doing now. So “transitory” is a word that people have had\ndifferent understandings of. For some, it carries a sense of “short lived,” and that’s, you know,\nthere’s a real time component—measured in months, let’s say. Really, for us, what “transitory”\nhas meant is that if something is transitory, it will not leave behind it permanently or very\npersistently higher inflation. So that’s why we, you know, we took a step back from “transitory.”\nWe said “expected to be transitory,” first of all, to show uncertainty around that—we’ve\nalways said that, by the way, in other contexts; we just hadn’t done it in the statement—but also\nto acknowledge, really, that it means different things to different people. And then we added\nsome language to really explain more what we’re talking about in paragraph two and\nparagraph three. We said that “supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the\nreopening of the economy have contributed to sizable price increases,” and we said, “Progress on\nvaccinations and an easing of supply constraints are expected to support continued gains in\nPage 10 of 29\nNovember 3, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\neconomic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation.” So we’re trying to\nexplain what we mean and also acknowledging more uncertainty about “transitory.”\nSo it’s, I mean, it’s become a word that’s attracted a lot of attention that maybe is\ndistracting from our message, which we want to be as clear as possible. Ultimately, the only\nother thing I would say is, look, we understand completely that it’s particularly people who are\nliving paycheck to paycheck or seeing higher grocery costs, higher gasoline costs—when the\nwinter comes, higher heating costs for their homes. We understand completely what they’re\ngoing through. And, you know, we will use our tools over time to make sure that that doesn’t\nbecome a permanent feature of life. Really, that’s one of our principal jobs, along with\nachieving maximum employment. And that’s our commitment.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We’ll go to Chris Rugaber of the Associated Press.\nCHRIS RUGABER. Great. Thank you, Michelle. Thank you, Chair Powell. Well, I\nwonder if you could update us. You talked about getting back to full employment, and so could\nyou update how you define that? I mean, you’ve, you know—a few months ago, yourself and\nother Fed officials talked about getting back to the pre-COVID labor market. There were even\nhints you might try to do something better than that. Now we heard talk of, as you mentioned,\npeople retiring, and there’s talk of not being able to get back as—all the jobs back because of\nthat and other trends. You did mention the prime-age folks. So can you give us some examples\nof things you're looking at, specifically, to measure full employment? Will you be looking at\nprime-age employment population ratio, for example, and, if so, do you need to see it get back to\npre-COVID levels to achieve maximum employment, or is there something short of that that\nwould work? Thank you.\nPage 11 of 29\nNovember 3, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. Thanks. So maximum employment is, it’s a broad—what would we\nsay?—broad-based and inclusive goal that’s not directly measurable and changes over time due\nto various factors. You can’t specify a specific goal. So it’s taking into account quite a broad\nrange of things, and, of course, employment—levels of employment—[and] participation are a\npart of that. But, in addition, there are other measures of what’s going on in the labor market,\nlike wages is a key measure of how tight the labor market is—the level of quits, the amount of\njob openings, the flows in and out of various states. So we look at so many different things, and\nyou make an overall judgment.\nNow, the temptation at the beginning of the recovery was to look at the data in February\nof 2020 and say, well, that’s the goal because we didn’t know any—that’s what we knew. We\nknew that was achievable in a context of low inflation. I think we’re in a, you know, we’re\nlearning that. We have to be humble about what we know about this economy, which is still\nvery, you know, COVID-affected, by the way. A lot of what we’re seeing in the last 90 days is\nbecause of Delta. We were on a path to a very different place. Delta put us on a different path.\nAnd we see these things. But, so I think we’re going to have to—ideally, we would have, we\nwould see further development of the labor market in a context where there isn’t another COVID\nspike, and then we would be able to see, I think, a lot. We would see whether—how does\nparticipation react in that world, in that sort of post-COVID world?\nRight now, people are staying out of the labor market because of caretaking [and]\nbecause of fear of COVID to a significant extent. You know, we thought that schools reopening\nand elapsing unemployment benefits would produce some sort of additional labor supply. That\ndoesn’t seem to have been the case, interestingly. So I think there’s room for a whole lot of\nhumility here, as we try to think about what maximum employment would be. We’re going to\nPage 12 of 29\nNovember 3, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nhave to see some time post-COVID so that we know—or post-Delta, anyway—to see what is\npossible. And I think the learning for those of us who lived through the last cycle is that, over\ntime, you can get to places that didn’t look possible.\nNow, what we also have now, though, is, we have high inflation. So we have a\ncompletely different situation now where we have high inflation, and we have to balance that\nwith what’s going on in the employment market. So it’s a complicated situation, and I would\nsay, we will, we hope to achieve significantly greater clarity about where this economy is going\nand what the characteristics of the post-pandemic economy are over the first half of next year.\nJOE PAVEL. Thanks. We’ll go to Howard Schneider at Reuters.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thanks, and thanks for doing this. So, given that answer\nabout employment, I would like to get back to Steve’s question a little bit. On a headline basis,\njust as it’s evolved this year, do you feel that the two tests on inflation have been met?\nCHAIR POWELL. Sorry, the two tests?\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. The two tests in the statement—the guidance that it has to hit\n2 percent and be on track to moderately be above 2 percent. Has the economy cleared that?\nCHAIR POWELL. That’s a decision for the Committee. I would put it to you this way.\nWhen we reach maximum employment, when we reach a state where labor market conditions are\nat maximum employment in the Committee’s judgment, it’s very possible that the inflation test\nwill already be met. We’re aware that that language sounds, it sounds a little out of touch with\nwhat’s going on, but, you know, we’re not at maximum employment. When that is the case,\nwe’ll look to see whether the inflation test is met, and there’s a good chance that it will be if you\nlook at how inflation has evolved in the last year and a half.\nPage 13 of 29\nNovember 3, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. So, to follow up, so you’re not willing to commit that the\ncurrent levels of inflation and their persistence have met “moderately” and “for some time.” So,\ngiven that, I mean, how should we wonder what “moderately” over and “for some time” mean?\nCHAIR POWELL. What I’m really saying is, that question is not before us right now.\nYou know, we had the question on when to taper. We’ve now answered that question and the\nspeed of it and all that. We have not focused on whether we meet the liftoff test, because we\ndon’t meet the liftoff test now because we’re not at maximum employment.\nWhat I’m saying is, given where inflation is and where it’s projected to be, let’s say we\ndo meet the maximum-employment test. Then the Committee—the question for the Committee\nat that time will be, has the inflation test been met? And, you know, I don’t want to get ahead of\nthe Committee on that, but the answer may very well be “Yes, it’s been met.” But we’re not\nasking that question today, because we’re not running a liftoff test. We’re not evaluating the\nliftoff test today. We didn’t have that discussion at today’s meeting. We did talk about the\neconomy and the development of the economy, but we didn’t ask ourselves whether the liftoff\ntest is met, because, you know, it’s clearly not met on the maximum-employment side.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let’s go to Matthew Boesler at Bloomberg.\nMATTHEW BOESLER. Hi, Chair Powell. Matthew Boesler with Bloomberg. So,\nwhen you’re looking at this question of assessing whether or not the U.S. economy is at\nmaximum employment, do you have a framework for making that judgment that is independent\nof what inflation is doing? And, if not, does it kind of complicate that assessment, given all of\nthe uncertainty about inflation right now and the inclination to believe that, you know, the high\ninflation we’re seeing is not related to capacity utilization in the labor market? Thank you.\nPage 14 of 29\nNovember 3, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. So we don’t actually define maximum employment as—we define it\nin terms of inflation, but, of course, there is a connection there. Maximum employment has to be\na level that is consistent with stable prices. But that’s not really how we think about it. We think\nabout maximum employment as looking at a broad range of things. You can’t just look at—\nunlike inflation, where you can have a number. But with maximum employment, you could be\nin a situation, hypothetically, where the unemployment rate is low, but there are many people\nwho are out of the labor force and will come back in. And so you wouldn’t really be at\nmaximum employment, because there’s this group that isn’t counted as unemployed.\nSo we look at a range of things. So the thing is, by many measures, we are at a very tight\nlabor market. I mentioned quits and job openings and wages and things. Many of them are\nsignaling a tight labor market, but the issue is, how persistent is that? Because you have people\nwho are held out of the labor market, you know, of their own—they’re holding themselves out of\nthe labor market because of caretaking needs or because of fear of COVID, or, for whatever\nreason, they’re staying out. And it’s clear that there are, you know—with tremendous demand\nfor workers and wages moving up, it does seem like we’re set up to go back to a higher job-\ncreation rate. So that would suggest that you’re not at maximum employment. So, at the end of\nthe day, it is a judgment thing. But, of course, at the end of it, it also has to be a level of\nemployment that’s consistent with price stability.\nMATTHEW BOESLER. And if I could just follow up briefly, you know, you’ve talked\na little bit about this possibility that the two goals might be in tension and how you would have\nto balance those two things. Could you talk a little bit about what the Fed’s process for\nbalancing those two goals would be in the event that, say, come next year, you decide there’s a\nserious risk of persistent inflationary pressures despite ongoing employment shortfalls?\nPage 15 of 29\nNovember 3, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes. I mean, again, it’s a risk-management thing. It’s not—I can’t\nreduce it to an equation, but, ultimately, it’s about risk management. So you want to be in a\nposition to act, to cover the full range of plausible outcomes, not just the base case. And in this\ncase, the risk is skewed. For now, it appears to be skewed toward higher inflation. So we need\nto be in a position to act in case it becomes necessary to do so or appropriate to do so, and we\nthink we will be. So that’s how we’re thinking about it. And I think, though, that, judgmentally,\ntoo, it’s appropriate to be patient. It’s appropriate for us to see what the labor market and what\nthe economy look like when they heal further.\nWe know that we were on a path to a different place, as I mentioned, when Delta arrived.\nAnd Delta stopped, it stopped job creation. It stopped that transition away from a goods-focused\neconomy where there’s excess demand for goods because there—services are not available.\nPeople are not traveling. That transition itself could help bring inflation down, because,\npresumably, people would spend a little less on goods while they start spending more on travel\nand all sorts of travel services and things like that.\nSo we want to see that healthy process unfold as we decide what the true state of the\neconomy is, and we think it will evolve in a way that will mean lower inflation. Bottlenecks\nshould be abating. We start to see that now with some of them, but, overall, they haven’t gotten\nbetter overall, and, you know, we’re very aware of that. So that’s really how we’re thinking\nabout it. We’re thinking that time will tell us more. In the meantime, we don’t think it’s time to\nraise rates now. You know, if we do conclude that it’s necessary to do so, then we’ll be patient,\nbut we won’t hesitate.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let’s go to Edward Lawrence at Fox Business.\nPage 16 of 29\nNovember 3, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking the call. So the Federal\nReserve—I want to talk about climate change. The Federal Reserve released a statement\ntoday—says “the Federal Reserve supports the efforts . . . to identify key issues and potential\nsolutions for the climate-related challenges most relevant to central banks and supervisory”\noutcomes. Is this putting us on the path to regulate what banks can offer loans on or invest in,\nlike coal plants or fossil fuels?\nCHAIR POWELL. So that’s not a decision for bank regulators or for any agency. That’s\na decision for elected representatives. So we feel that any role that we have—and we do think\nwe have a role in climate change. It relates to our existing mandates, and our existing mandates\nare, really, prudential regulation of financial institutions. We expect them, and the public will\nexpect us to expect them, to understand and be in a position to manage their risks. So that’s\nphysical risk, and it’s transition risk for climate. And, by the way, the large financial institutions\nare doing this already, and, you know, we think that’s right within our mandate.\nThere’s also a financial stability question, the overall stability of the financial system.\nAnd so, from that standpoint, we can do research. We can try to help understand what will the\npathways be through which climate change effects the economy—both physical risk and\ntransition risk. That’s what we can do, and that’s what we will do. And we’ll do it well. Within\nthe frame of our existing mandates, we’ll do it well. We’re not the people who will decide the\nnational strategy on climate change. That has to be elected people, and not so much us. We feel\nlike we have that narrow mandate, and we will do it well.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Great, thank you. Victoria Guida at Politico.\nPage 17 of 29\nNovember 3, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Chair Powell. So the Fed recently announced that there is\ngoing to be new conflict-of-interest rules for investments by Fed officials, and this follows,\nobviously, the resignation of two regional Fed presidents. And I’m just wondering, do you think\nthat there is more that you will need to do to rebuild the credibility of the Fed, such as, you\nknow, requiring officials to put their assets in blind trusts? And also, if you could speak to\nwhether you have any concerns that any rules or laws were broken by Fed officials. Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So we, you know, we—let me just say that this system, the ethics\nsystem we had in place had been in place for decades and had, as far as we know, served us well,\nand then that was no longer the case. And so we had no moment of denial about that. As a\ngroup, we stepped in, and we took the actions that we took. And, you know, within one FOMC\ncycle, we announced a new set of rules to, you know, to try to put us back where we need to be,\nwhich is, we need to have the complete trust of the American people that we’re working in their\ninterest all the time—absolutely critical to our work, as it is for any government agency. And I\nfeel like this called that into question. So we reacted, I would characterize it, strongly and\nforcefully. If there were other things that we could do that were reasonable, we would certainly\ndo them.\nSo you asked me about blind trusts. You know, the overall authority for ethics around\nthese issues in the federal government is the Office of Government Ethics, OGE. And they have\na long-held position which is not favorable to blind trusts. They do not encourage them. They\ndon’t think they’re effective. They think they’re cumbersome. And they think there are better\nways to get at the things that need to be done. And those are the things that we’re actually doing.\nSo I don’t know that there are any blind trusts, for that reason, because they are the, they’re the\nregulator. They say this on their website, if you look. In terms of laws broken, you know, I\nPage 18 of 29\nNovember 3, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nasked the inspector general to look to see whether there were rules broken and whether there\nwere laws broken, and I won’t speculate on that. But that is with the inspector general now and,\nof course, out of my hands.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We’ll go to Mike McKee at Bloomberg.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Mr. Chairman, the critics of your patience policy argue that, given\nthe long and variable lags with which monetary policy works, that you are likely to end up, given\ninflation, by having to raise rates faster and farther than you would have liked and, therefore,\nsend the economy into recession. Given the fact that, basically, your forecast has been chasing\ninflation over the last year, and now you’re talking about it not coming down until the second or\nthird quarter, why would they be wrong in thinking that?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, so, let me say what’s happened—and we’re very, very\nstraightforward about it—is that inflation has come in higher than expected, and bottlenecks have\nbeen more persistent and more prevalent. We see that just like everybody else does, and we see\nthat they’re now on track to persist well into next year. That was not expected—not expected by\nus, not expected by other macro forecasters.\nNow, let me say, you know, it’s difficult enough to just forecast the economy in normal\ntimes. When you’re talking about, you know, global supply chains in turmoil, it’s a whole\ndifferent thing. And you’re talking about a pandemic that’s holding people out of the labor force\nfor reasons that we can sample, but we don’t have a lot of experience with this. So it’s very,\nvery difficult to forecast and not easy to set policy. So we have to set policy, though. So that’s\nwhat we’re doing.\nAnd, you know, so, to look at your question this way, I don’t think that we’re behind the\ncurve. I actually believe that policy is well positioned to address the range of plausible\nPage 19 of 29\nNovember 3, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\noutcomes, and that’s what we need to do. I do think it would be premature to raise rates today.\nThat’s not—I don’t think that’s controversial. Certainly, I don’t know anyone arguing for that\ntoday. And the reason is that there’s still ground to cover to get to maximum employment. And\nwe don’t want to stop that when there’s good reason to think—there’s still good reason to think,\nalthough it’s been delayed, clearly, there’s good reason to think that the economy will reopen,\nparticularly if we do get past, you know, significant outbreaks of COVID. That’s when we’re\nreally going to see what the characteristics of the labor market are.\nAnd, you know, I think, you know, the bottlenecks that we’re seeing in global supply\nchains around goods and, frankly, now at our own domestic ports, because demand is stronger\nthan the capacity of those ports—those things are going to work themselves out. We have a\nflexible economy. It’ll take some time, but, you know, it took—you know, the experts managed\nto create a vaccine faster than, certainly, than I expected. And I think this stuff will work itself\nout over the course of next year. That is my baseline understanding, and that’s a very widely\nheld one among people.\nBut, you know, we are prepared for different eventualities, and we will use our tools to\nachieve price stability and maximum employment. And we’re going to let the data lead us to\nwhere we need to go. Our policy will adapt—and has already adapted—to the changing\nunderstanding of inflation and of bottlenecks and the whole supply-side story—which is also\npartly a demand story. So our policy will continue to adapt as is appropriate.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let’s go to Nancy Marshall-Genzer at Marketplace.\nNANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Hi, Chair Powell. Thanks for taking our questions.\nSo you announced that the Fed is going to taper at a rate of, starting at $15 billion a month, and\nthat’s more than twice the pace of the last taper. So why are you tapering faster this time?\nPage 20 of 29\nNovember 3, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. The economy is in quite a different place than when we tapered back\nin, I guess it was, 2013. We were much farther away from maximum employment. Inflation\nwas much lower. This is an economy where demand is very, very strong, very strong, and job\nopenings substantially exceed the number of unemployed people. So the need for further\nstimulus is far less than it was in 2013, where we still had quite a ways to go. I mean, after we\nbegan that taper, it was still many years before we reached what I would characterize as\nconditions consistent with maximum employment, let alone price stability.\nSo this is quite a different situation, and, you know, the Committee unanimously felt\ntoday that we had met the test that we’d articulated, and this was appropriate. And this is faster\nthan, you know, than what people had expected six months ago. It’s earlier and faster, and that’s\nbecause our, as I mentioned, our policy has been adapting to the situation as it evolves, as it’s\nclarifying itself, and that’s partly because we see inflation coming in higher—so.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let’s go to Mike Derby.\nMICHAEL DERBY. Yes, thank you for taking my question. I wonder if the Fed has\ngiven any thoughts yet to the endgame for the balance sheet in terms of, you know, once you get\nthe taper process complete, will you hold the balance sheet steady, or will you allow it to start\npassively winding down? And then, in a related question, do you have any greater insight into\nwhat Fed bond buying actually does for the economy? In terms of its economic impact, have\nyou been able to, you know, measure it or quantify it in any fashion, you know, because I’m sure\nyou know there’s often been questions about, what is bond buying actually doing to help the\neconomy?\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So in terms of the balance sheet, those questions that you\nmention—we haven’t gone back to them. Now that we’ve tapered, I expect that that’s exactly\nPage 21 of 29\nNovember 3, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nwhat we’ll do in coming meetings. And we’ll do it in an orderly fashion, and we’ll talk about\nreinvestment and all those things. And we don’t have to make decisions on those yet. But, you\nknow, typically, when we’re doing a new subject like that, we’ll have a series of briefings and\ndiscussions. And that’s what we will now begin to do.\nIn terms of the effect of asset purchases on the economy, so, there’s a tremendous amount\nof research and scholarship on this. And, you know, you can kind of—you can find different\npeople coming out with different views. But I would say, the most mainstream view would be\nthat you’re at the effective lower bound, so how do you affect longer-term rates? There are two\nways. One, so you can’t lower rates—let’s say you can’t lower rates any further, hypothetically.\nSo you can give forward guidance. You can say, we’re going to keep the rates low for a period\nof time, either [for] a specific period, [or] until certain conditions are met. The markets will do\nthe math, and that’ll have an effect on longer-term borrowings even, you know, 10, 30 years out\nkind of thing. So that’s one thing. The other thing you can do is, you just go buy those\nsecurities, buy longer-term securities. That will drive down longer-term rates and hold them\nlower, and, you know, rates right across the, right across the rate spectrum matter for borrowers.\nSo lower rates encourage more borrowing, encourage more economic activity. People—you can\nservice your debt. You have more free cash flow. You know, it’s not different from what we do\nat the short end. So that was discussed long before anybody did it. That was—I think Milton\nFriedman said that that was what you could do if you were pinned at the lower bound, many,\nmany years ago.\nSo, anyway, that’s how it’s supposed to work. And, you know, it’s quite hard to be\nprecise about these things because, you know, you only have one economy, and you can’t run\ntwo different economies right next to each other and do a scientific experiment. But most people\nPage 22 of 29\nNovember 3, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nfind—most of the findings are that it does support economic activity in the way that you would\nexpect, which is to say, at the margin, more economic activity with lower rates, which is why we\ndo what we do. More accommodative financial conditions lead to more economic activity, over\ntime, with a lag. So I think that’s the main finding I would say on QE.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We’re going to go to Paul Lamonica at CNN.\nPAUL LAMONICA. Chair Powell, Chair Powell, you’ve addressed already questions\nabout the stock purchases that took place from some of the regional Fed presidents and, you\nknow, addressing the American people to make sure that they can trust the Fed. I was\nwondering, also, in light of the fact that, you know, we now have questions about your own\nfuture, whether or not President Biden will nominate you for a second term, what would you\nsay—to the President and to senators that, potentially, you know, will be voting on a\nrenomination—about this, specifically with regards to your future as Fed Chair for a possible\nsecond term?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I’m not going to—I won’t have any—I will answer your question,\nPaul, but I’m not going to have any comment whatsoever on the renomination process at all.\nPAUL LAMONICA. Fair enough.\nCHAIR POWELL. I will say, though, that I have briefed Administration officials, and\nI’ve briefed people on Capitol Hill in detail about what we did and why we did it, and seeking\ntheir feedback, getting their reaction. But, you know, this is—part of my job is—Congress has\noversight over the Fed, and we take that very seriously. So if you’re on our, one of the two\ncommittees that has oversight over us, then I’m in regular contact with you, probably. And, you\nknow, when something like this comes up, I’m on the phone. I’m offering to meet with you and\nexplain it to you and answer your questions and identify any concerns people might have. That’s\nPage 23 of 29\nNovember 3, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\njust part of my job. So I do that. I don’t talk about particular conversations. But you can\nassume I’ll always do that. And I certainly did it in this case.\nPAUL LAMONICA. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let’s go to Hannah Lang at the American Banker.\nHANNAH LANG. Hi. I wanted to ask about the supplementary leverage ratio. Is the\nFed still planning on taking comment on ways to permanently address that, and how concerned\nare you, ultimately, about banks’ willingness to intermediate in the Treasury markets without a\npermanent fix?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I don’t have anything for you on supplemental leverage ratio right\nnow. We are looking at ways to, if there are ways we can address liquidity issues through that\nchannel. We’re also—we also have a—there’s a working group headed by [the] Treasury about,\nover Treasury [securities] markets, and what happened in the acute phase of the pandemic, and\nwhat structural things may need to be done. So that would be part of that workstream, and I\nknow that there’s a lot going on. I’m not sure when that report will be out.\nSo it’s work under way. That’s one of the many issues that are part of that, along with\nthings like central clearing of Treasuries, greater central clearing, and, you know, many other\nideas. It’s important that we have a liquid Treasury [securities] market. It’s a huge public\nbenefit that we do, and, you know, I think we need to do those things that enable that, you know,\nwhile also assuring the safety and soundness of our largest financial institutions, who tend to be\nthe main dealers. So we have to make sure that that’s always a first order of concern as well.\nHANNAH LANG. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let’s go to Brian Cheung at Yahoo Finance.\nPage 24 of 29\nNovember 3, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nBRIAN CHEUNG. Hi, Chairman Powell. Brian Cheung, Yahoo Finance. So, just to\nexpand on the ethics conversation, you talked about how you engage with people on Capitol Hill\nand in the Administration. You talked about what you’ve done already, but I’m just wondering\nif you can take a step back and just assess whether or not there was reputational damage as a\nresult of that, either from the public’s view or from the financial community’s view of the\nFederal Reserve’s independence. And then, secondly, do you look back on the whole episode\nand have thoughts on your individual responsibility in preventing something like this from\nhaving happened?\nCHAIR POWELL You know, I think it’s too soon to say what the reputational damage\nis. I think, from the very beginning, my reaction was: We need to deal with this\nstraightforwardly, transparently, and forcefully. And that’s what we’re going to do. I mean, it’s,\nit means everything to me that we do whatever it takes to make sure that nothing like this\nhappens again, and I like to think we’ve made a real good start on that. If you think about it, you\ncannot execute a trade unless it’s precleared, and then you have to say, “Execute.” It’s not even\na trade. Really, there’s no trading going on. This is for investment and, you know, getting\nliquidity for life’s expenses. But you then have to wait 45 days to actually execute that sale or\npurchase. So I think it’s a pretty good system. We’ll always be looking to make it better.\nSo in terms of our independence, you know, look, I think we will address this, and I think\nwe have. And I like to think it’s enough, but it’s going to, you know—we’re just beginning to\nimplement it. We have to write the rules, which we’re doing, you know, as quickly as possible.\nWe need more people. We’re going to have to resource this much more significantly here at the\nBoard, and also, we’re going to need appropriate technology, because, you know, the Fed has\nmore than—the System has more than 30,000 employees. Not all of them, far few of them, will\nPage 25 of 29\nNovember 3, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nbe covered by this, but the senior officers, who will be covered by this, will, you know, will have\nto have technology access, and it’s going to have to work efficiently. So there’s a lot of work to\ndo to implement.\nYou know, again, I would just say, this system has been in place for decades. And it was\nin place when I took over. It was in place for the last, at least the last three or four Chairs. And,\nyou know, it was what it was. And, you know, it proved to have weaknesses in it. And part of\nthat was, it wasn’t uniformly enforced across the System. I’m a big believer in the value of the\nFederal Reserve System and the Reserve Banks. But you had 12 different ethics officers at\n12 different Banks. And you had ethics people here. And, you know, compliance wasn’t, it\nwasn’t all exactly the same. It was a little bit different and uneven, and also, the rules were—\nyou know, we didn’t imagine the problems that happened. And they may have actually been—I\ndon’t know this—but they may actually have been in compliance with the specifics of our rules.\nThey were clearly not in compliance with the part of our rules that said, don’t do anything that\nwould create that appearance. I mean, that’s clear. This was a bad appearance.\nSo, anyway, what can we do? We are where we are. It happened, and we just have to\ndeal with it forthrightly and transparently and “own” it and step up to this, you know, meet this\nmoment. I’m totally committed to doing that. And, again, if there are better ideas, I’d love to\nhear them, but I think we have so far made a good start.\nBRIAN CHEUNG. When you say you spoke with Administration officials, did that\ninclude the President?\nCHAIR POWELL. I’m not going to answer who I spoke to at all. I just, I’m not going to\ngive you any names, so don’t take that as a “yes” or “no.” I’m just not going to start down that\nroad.\nPage 26 of 29\nNovember 3, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMICHELLE SMITH. Okay. Thank you. We’re going to go to Jeff Cox for the last\nquestion.\nJEFF COX. Yes, thank you. Chair, I just want to dig a little bit deeper on employment.\nWe’ve seen what’s been called the great resignation, folks leaving their jobs in record numbers.\nIs there any feeling there that maybe you’ve been accused of “fighting the last war”—that\nperhaps the labor dynamics have changed in the post-COVID environment and that full\nemployment may not look like what it looked like before?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes. So, what’s happening is, people are leaving their jobs. They’re\nquitting their jobs in all-time-high numbers—but, in many cases, going back into employment\nand getting higher wages. So a lot of the higher wages you’re seeing are for job switchers rather\nthan incumbents. So that’s just, that’s a sign of a really strong labor market, as opposed to\npeople just running off and quitting. There have also been—there are a significant number of\nretirements, and we’ll just have to see what that means.\nSo, toward the end of the last cycle, which was the longest in our recorded economic\nhistory, we did see labor force participation moving up well above what economists estimate was\nthe trend, and part of that was people staying in the labor force or just not retiring at the rates\nthey were expected to retire. So maybe this was just catch-up on that. I am a believer that, over\ntime, you won’t know how far—you won’t know what can happen with labor force participation\nin advance. You’re just going to have to give it some time, because we saw that over and over\nagain.\nThere are things that we can, where we can say, you know, this is where the limit is.\nLabor force participation is a much more flexible subject for me, and so I do think we need to be\nPage 27 of 29\nNovember 3, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nhumble about what the limits are of labor force participation. But we expect labor force\nparticipation to pick up. We don’t know the pace at which it will do so.\nSo in terms of full employment, as I discussed earlier, I think, at the very beginning of the\nrecovery, the natural thing to do was to look back at labor conditions, labor market conditions in\nFebruary of 2010, at the end of the longest expansion in our history. There was so much to like\nabout that labor market, a really historically good labor market—never perfect, but a good labor\nmarket.\nWe’re in a different world now. This is a—it’s just very different. The pandemic\nrecession was the deepest, and the recovery has been the fastest. And wages didn’t really go\ndown. And, you know, real incomes were more than fully replaced by fiscal policy [support].\nAll of this is completely unusual. You know, an economy where inflation was driven by services\nis now inflation where—all the inflation is in goods, which have had negative inflation for a\nquarter-century.\nSo you ask about full employment. I think we have to—I’m very open to the thought that\nit’s going to be an empirical question of where it is located, and we’re just going to learn more\nand more. I mean, one thing we’ll learn, I think, I hope we’ll learn in the next, in the near term\nis, once the Delta variant really does continue to decline, what’s going to happen to\nemployment? Are we going to start to see over the winter, you know, significant increases in\njobs again? If you look back, the three-, six-, and nine-month average job creation is between\n550,000 and 600,000. So if you think of that as a stronger—you don’t have to think back to the\nmillion-job months of June and July. You can just think, okay, 550 to 600—if we should get\nback on that path, then we would be making good progress, and we like to see that, of course. So\nPage 28 of 29\nNovember 3, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nwe’ll know so much more. And, believe me, we understand. It’s a different world in so many\nways. And we’re very open to that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you all for joining us today.\nCHAIR POWELL. Thank you.\nPage 29 of 29"

    "statement": "For release at 2 p.m. EST December 15, 2021\nThe Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the\nU.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment\nand price stability goals.\nWith progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic\nactivity and employment have continued to strengthen. The sectors most adversely\naffected by the pandemic have improved in recent months but continue to be affected\nby COVID-19. Job gains have been solid in recent months, and the unemployment\nrate has declined substantially. Supply and demand imbalances related to the\npandemic and the reopening of the economy have continued to contribute to elevated\nlevels of inflation. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part\nreflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S.\nhouseholds and businesses.\nThe path of the economy continues to depend on the course of the virus. Progress\non vaccinations and an easing of supply constraints are expected to support continued\ngains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation. Risks\nto the economic outlook remain, including from new variants of the virus.\nThe Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate\nof 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to\nkeep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent. With inflation\nhaving exceeded 2 percent for some time, the Committee expects it will be\nappropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached\nlevels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment. In\nlight of inflation developments and the further improvement in the labor market, the\n(more)\nFor release at 2 p.m. EST December 15, 2021\n-2-\nCommittee decided to reduce the monthly pace of its net asset purchases by $20\nbillion for Treasury securities and $10 billion for agency mortgage-backed securities.\nBeginning in January, the Committee will increase its holdings of Treasury securities\nby at least $40 billion per month and of agency mortgage‑backed securities by at least\n$20 billion per month. The Committee judges that similar reductions in the pace of\nnet asset purchases will likely be appropriate each month, but it is prepared to adjust\nthe pace of purchases if warranted by changes in the economic outlook. The Federal\nReserve’s ongoing purchases and holdings of securities will continue to foster smooth\nmarket functioning and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the\nflow of credit to households and businesses.\nIn assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will\ncontinue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic\noutlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy\nas appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s\ngoals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of\ninformation, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation\npressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.\nVoting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H.

    "press_conf": "December 15, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nTranscript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference\nDecember 15, 2021\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed\nto achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and\nprice stability.\nToday, in support of these goals, the Federal Open Market Committee kept interest rates\nnear zero and updated its assessment of the progress that the economy has made toward the\ncriteria specified in the Committee’s forward guidance for interest rates. In addition, in light of\nthe strengthening labor market and elevated inflation pressures, we decided to speed up the\nreductions in our asset purchases. As I will explain, economic developments and changes in the\noutlook warrant this evolution of monetary policy, which will continue to provide appropriate\nsupport for the economy.\nEconomic activity is on track to expand at a robust pace this year, reflecting progress on\nvaccinations and the reopening of the economy. Aggregate demand remains very strong, buoyed\nby fiscal and monetary policy support and the healthy financial positions of households and\nbusinesses. The rise in COVID cases in recent weeks, along with the emergence of the Omicron\nvariant, pose[s] risks to the outlook. Notwithstanding the effects of the virus and supply\nconstraints, FOMC participants continue to foresee rapid growth. As shown in our Summary of\nEconomic Projections (SEP), the median projection for real GDP growth stands at 5.5 percent\nthis year and 4 percent next year.\nAmid improving labor market conditions and very strong demand for workers, the\neconomy has been making rapid progress toward maximum employment. Job gains have been\nsolid in recent months, averaging 378,000 per month over the last three months. The\nunemployment rate has declined substantially—falling 6/10 of a percentage point since our last\nPage 1 of 31\nDecember 15, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nmeeting and reaching 4.2 percent in November. The recent improvements in labor market\nconditions have narrowed the differences in employment across groups, especially for workers at\nthe lower end of the wage distribution, as well as for African Americans and Hispanics. Labor\nforce participation showed a welcome rise in November—but remains subdued, in part reflecting\nthe aging of the population and retirements. In addition, some who otherwise would be seeking\nwork report that they are out of the labor force because of factors related to the pandemic,\nincluding caregiving needs and ongoing concerns about the virus. At the same time, employers\nare having difficulties filling job openings, and wages are rising at their fastest pace in many\nyears. How long the labor shortages will persist is unclear, particularly if additional waves of the\nvirus occur. Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the labor market to continue to improve,\nwith the median projection for the unemployment rate declining to 3.5 percent by the end of the\nyear. Compared with the projections made in September, participants have revised their\nunemployment rate projections noticeably lower for this year and next.\nSupply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and [to] the reopening of the\neconomy have continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation. In particular, bottlenecks\nand supply constraints are limiting how quickly production can respond to higher demand in the\nnear term. These problems have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated, exacerbated by\nwaves of the virus. As a result, overall inflation is running well above our 2 percent longer-run\ngoal and will likely continue to do so well into next year. While the drivers of higher inflation\nhave been predominantly connected to the dislocations caused by the pandemic, price increases\nhave now spread to a broader range of goods and services. Wages have also risen briskly, but,\nthus far, wage growth has not been a major contributor to the elevated levels of inflation. We are\nattentive to the risks that persistent real wage growth in excess of productivity [growth] could put\nPage 2 of 31\nDecember 15, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nupward pressure on inflation. Like most forecasters, we continue to expect inflation to decline to\nlevels closer to our 2 percent longer-run goal by the end of next year. The median inflation\nprojection of FOMC participants falls from 5.3 percent this year to 2.6 percent next year; this\ntrajectory is notably higher than projected in September.\nWe understand that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least\nable to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We are\ncommitted to our price-stability goal. We will use our tools both to support the economy and a\nstrong labor market and to prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched. We will be\nwatching carefully to see whether the economy is evolving in line with expectations.\nThe Fed’s monetary policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote\nmaximum employment and stable prices for the American people. In support of these goals, the\nCommittee reaffirmed the 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate. We also updated\nour assessment of the progress the economy has made toward the criteria specified in our\nforward guidance for the federal funds rate. With inflation having exceeded 2 percent for some\ntime, the Committee expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market\nconditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum\nemployment.\nAll FOMC participants forecast that this remaining test will be met next year. The\nmedian projection for the appropriate level of the federal funds rate is 0.9 percent at the end of\n2022, about ½ percentage point higher than projected in September. Participants expect a\ngradual pace of policy firming, with the level of the federal funds rate generally near estimates of\nits longer-run level by the end of 2024. Of course, these projections do not represent a\nPage 3 of 31\nDecember 15, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCommittee decision or plan, and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a\nyear or more from now.\nAt today’s meeting, the Committee also decided to double the pace of reductions in its\nasset purchases. Beginning in mid-January, we will reduce the monthly pace of our net asset\npurchases by $20 billion for Treasury securities and $10 billion for agency mortgage-backed\nsecurities. If the economy evolves broadly as expected, similar reductions in the pace of net\nasset purchases will likely be appropriate each month, implying that increases in our securities\nholdings would cease by mid-March—a few months sooner than we anticipated in early\nNovember. We are phasing out our purchases more rapidly because, with elevated inflation\npressures and a rapidly strengthening labor market, the economy no longer needs increasing\namounts of policy support. In addition, a quicker conclusion of our asset purchases will better\nposition policy to address the full range of plausible economic outcomes. We remain prepared to\nadjust the pace of purchases if warranted by changes in the economic outlook. And, even after\nour balance sheet stops expanding, our holdings of securities will continue to foster\naccommodative financial conditions.\nTo conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and\nbusinesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the\nFed will do everything we can to complete the recovery in employment and achieve our price-\nstability goal.\nThank you. I look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Mr. Chair, we’ll go to Rachel from the Washington Post.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Thank you very much, Michelle. And thank you, Chair Powell, for\ntaking our questions. The latest FOMC materials say that the FOMC thinks it will be appropriate\nPage 4 of 31\nDecember 15, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nto keep rates near zero until labor market conditions reach levels consistent with maximum\nemployment. And there are also three rate hikes penciled in the projections for next year. In\norder to set up those hikes, what will maximum employment have to look like? When will you\nknow that that threshold has been met? And how will that be communicated? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So maximum employment, if you look at our Statement on Longer-\nRun Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, maximum employment is something that we look at a\nbroad range of indicators. And those would include, of course, things like the unemployment\nrate, the labor force participation rate, job openings, wages, flows in and out of the labor force in\nvarious parts of the labor force. We’d also tend to look broadly and inclusively at different\ndemographic groups and not just at the headline and aggregate numbers. So that’s a—that’s a\njudgment for the Committee to make. The Committee will make a judgment that we’ve achieved\nlabor market conditions consistent with maximum employment when it makes that—it is,\nadmittedly, a judgment call because it’s a range of factors. Unlike inflation, where we have one\nnumber that sort of dominates, it’s a broad range of things. So, as I mentioned in my opening\nremarks, in my view, we are making rapid progress toward maximum employment. And you see\nthat, of course, in some of the factors that I mentioned.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Great, thank you. Steve at CNBC.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. All right. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My question is: If—It’s often\nsaid that monetary policy has long and variable lags. How does continuing to buy assets now,\neven though it’s at a slower pace, address the current inflation problem? Won’t the impact of\ntoday’s changes not really have any impact for six months or a year down the road on the current\ninflation problem? And aren’t you actually lengthening that time by continuing to buy assets\nPage 5 of 31\nDecember 15, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nsuch that it could be not until the long and variable lag after you end purchases sometime in\nMarch that you’ll start to have any impact on the inflation problem?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, on the first part of your question, which is, “Why not stop\npurchasing now?,” I would just say this: We’ve learned that, in dealing with balance sheet\nissues, we’ve learned that it’s best to take a careful sort of methodical approach to make\nadjustments. Markets can be sensitive to it. And we thought that this was—this was a doubling\nof the speed. We’re basically two meetings away now from finishing the taper. And we thought\nthat was the appropriate way to go. So we announced it, and that’s what will happen.\nYou know, the question of long and variable lags is, is an interesting one. That’s, that’s\nMilton Friedman’s famous statement. And I do think that in this world, where everything is—\nwhere the global financial markets are connected together, financial conditions can change very\nquickly. And my own sense is that they get into—financial conditions affect the economy fairly\nrapidly, longer than the traditional thought of, you know, a year or 18 months. Shorter than that,\nrather. But in addition, when we communicate about what we’re going to do, the markets move\nimmediately [in response] to that. So financial conditions are changing to reflect, you know, the\nforecasts that we made and basically, which was, I think, fairly in line with what markets were\nexpecting. But financial conditions don’t wait to change until, until things actually happen.\nThey, they change on the expectation of things happening. So I don’t think it’s a question of\nhaving to wait.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Can I just follow up? Thinking about having to wait, is it still the\npolicy, or the position, of the Committee that you will not raise rates until the taper is complete?\nThank you.\nPage 6 of 31\nDecember 15, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes. The sense of that, of course, being that buying assets is adding\naccommodation and raising rates is removing accommodation. Since we’re two meetings away\nfrom completing the taper, assuming things go as, as expected, I think if we wanted to lift off\nbefore then, then, then what we—you would stop the taper potentially sooner. But it’s not\nsomething I expect to happen. But I do—I do not think it would be appropriate, and we—and we\ndon’t find ourselves in a situation where we—where we might have to raise rates while we’re\nstill purchasing assets.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Okay, let’s go to Colby at the FT.\nCOLBY SMITH. Thank you, Michelle. Chair Powell, I’m curious exactly how much\ndistance you think there should be between the end of the taper and the first interest rate increase.\nBack in 2014, the guidance was—that was given was for the fed funds rate to remain at the target\nlevel for a considerable time after the end of the asset purchase program. Is that an approach you\nsupport now? Or does the current economic situation warrant something a bit different?\nThank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So we, we haven’t made any decision of that nature. And so, no, I\nwouldn’t say that’s our position at all. We really haven’t taken a position on that. I will say that\nwe did talk today–We had our first discussion about the balance sheet, for example. And we\nwent through the way—the sequence of events regarding the runoff and that sort of thing with\nthe balance sheet, last time. And I think people thought that was an interesting discussion. They\nthought that it was informative, but people pointed out that this is a significantly different\neconomic situation that we have at the current time, and that those—the differences that we see\nnow would tend to influence how we think about the balance sheet. And the same thing would\nbe true about raising rates. I don’t—I don’t foresee that there would be that kind of very\nPage 7 of 31\nDecember 15, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nextended wait at this time. The economy is so much stronger. I was here at the Fed when we\nlifted off the last time. And the economy is so much stronger now, so much closer to full\nemployment. Inflation is running well above target, and growth is well above potential. There\nwouldn’t be the need for that kind of long delay. Having said that, I—you know, we’ll make this\ndecision in coming meetings, and it’s not—it’s not a decision that the Committee has really\nfocused on yet.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Nick at the Wall Street Journal.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Thank you, Nick Timiraos at the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell,\nin March you answered a question about maximum employment like this: You said 4 percent\nwould be a nice unemployment rate to get to, but it’ll take more than that to get to maximum\nemployment. More recently, you have hinted at a possible distinction between the level of\nmaximum employment that’s achievable in the short run versus in the long run. Has your view\nof the level of maximum employment changed this year? And if so, how? And how close is the\neconomy right now to your judgment of the short-run level of maximum employment?\nThank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Right. So the—you know, the thing is, we’re not going back to the\nsame economy we had in February of 2020. And I think early on, that was—the sense was that\nthat’s where we were headed. The post-pandemic labor market, and the economy in general, will\nbe different. And the maximum level of employment that’s consistent with price stability\nevolves over time within a—within a business cycle and over a longer period, in part reflecting\n[the] evolution of the factors that affect labor supply, including those related to the pandemic. So\nI would say: Look, we’re, we’re at 4.2 percent now and it’s been—the unemployment rate has\nbeen dropping very quickly. So we’re already in the vicinity of 4 percent.\nPage 8 of 31\nDecember 15, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nThe way in which—The important metric that has been disappointing really has been\nlabor force participation, of course, where we had widely thought—I had certainly thought—\nthat, last fall, as unemployment insurance ran off, as vaccinations increased, [and] as schools\nreopened, that we would see a significant surge, if you will, or at least a surge, in labor force\nparticipation. So we’ve begun to see some improvement. We certainly welcome the 2/10\nimprovement that we got in the November report. But I do think that it’s—it feels likely now\nthat the return to higher participation is going to take longer. And, in fact, that’s, that’s been the\npattern in past cycles—that labor force participation has tended to recover in the wake of a strong\nrecovery in unemployment, which is what we’re getting right now. So you—it could well have\nbeen that this cycle was different because of the short nature of it and the very strong—the\nnumber of job openings, for example, you would have thought that that would have pulled\npeople back in. But, really, it’s the pandemic, it’s a range of factors. But the reality is, we don’t\nhave a strong labor force participation recovery yet, and we may not have it for some time. At\nthe same time, we have to make policy now. And inflation is well above target. So this is\nsomething we need to take into—take into account.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. If I could—if I could follow up, you’ve talked recently about risk\nmanagement. And so does that mean that the Committee might feel compelled to raise interest\nrates before you’re convinced that you’ve achieved the employment test in your forward\nguidance?\nCHAIR POWELL. So this is—this is not at all a decision that the Committee has made.\nBut you’re really asking a question about how our framework works. And, yes, there is a—\nthere’s a provision, it used to be called the “balanced approach” provision, that says, in effect,\nthat in situations in which the pursuit of the maximum-employment goal and [the pursuit of] the\nPage 9 of 31\nDecember 15, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nprice-stability goal are not complementary, we have to take account of the distance from the goal\nand the—and the speed at which we’re approaching it. And so that is, in effect, an “off-ramp”\nwhich could, in concept, be taken and it’s in our framework, it’s been in our framework a long\ntime. I’ve talked about it on a number of occasions. It, it is a provision that would enable us to,\nin this case, because of high inflation, move before achieving maximum employment. Now,\nwe’re—as I said, we’re making rapid progress toward maximum employment in my—in my\nthinking, in my opinion. And I don’t at all know that we will—that we’ll have to invoke that,\nthat paragraph. But just as a factual matter, that is part of our framework—and has been, really,\nfor a very long time.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thanks. We’ll go to Howard at Reuters.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thanks, as usual. So I guess I gotta ask about the elephant in\nthe room, which is the Omicron variant. You know, this seems to already be pushing one of\nyour colleagues, the Bank of England, off its course. Things have evolved very fast there.\nHasn’t quite hit the shores of the U.S. in full force yet. But people seem to expect it to. So I’m\nwondering, in your feelings about this, are you convinced that this is going to be perhaps a more\ninfectious, but less serious, variant of the virus? Or are you simply confident that the U.S.\neconomy can continue its divorce from the pandemic?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, I think there’s a lot of uncertainty, which is why we—why we\ncalled it out in our statement, our postmeeting statement, as a risk. It’s—we, we follow the same\nexperts and I—we, we talk privately to the same experts that everyone else does and read the\nsame articles in the paper and the same research and, you know, so the—you mentioned the early\nassessment is highly transmissible, perhaps not as severe, some continuing protection from, from\nPage 10 of 31\nDecember 15, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nexisting vaccines and also existing immunity from having had the disease. That’s a first draft.\nWe’re a long way from knowing what it will turn out to be. It may well come to the United\nStates and replace Delta as the dominant variant fairly quickly. That could easily happen.\nI think there’s another step there, though—which is what’s going to be the effect on the\neconomy. And that will depend, you know, on how much it suppresses demand as opposed to\nsuppressing supply. It is not clear how big the effects would be on either inflation or growth or\nhiring on top of what’s already going on, which is quite a strong, you know, wave of Delta that’s\nhitting large parts of the country across the northern United States and all the way to the eastern\nseaboard and now coming down. We’re having quite a wave of Delta. So coming in on top of\nthat, again, it’s very difficult to say what the economic effects would be. I do think, wave upon\nwave, people are learning to live with this. More and more people are getting vaccinated. So\n[vaccinated] people who get the new variant, it affects them much less than it tends to affect, in\nthe aggregate, people who are not vaccinated. So the more people get vaccinated, the less the\neconomic effect. It doesn’t mean it won’t have an economic effect. Delta had an effect of\nslowing down hiring. And it actually—it had an effect on global supply chains. And that sort\nof—that hurt the process of the global supply chains getting worked out. So it can have an\neconomic effect. I just think, at this point, we don’t know much. We’ll know a whole lot more\nin three weeks, and we’ll know more than that in six weeks.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. But if I can follow up: You’re clearly, sort of from a risk\nstandpoint, comfortable putting away one of your tools pretty soon. Which sort of implies that\nwhatever Omicron brings, you’re comfortable the economy can handle it without quantitative\neasing.\nPage 11 of 31\nDecember 15, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes. Yes, look, I think—if you look at the state of the economy and\nthe amount—the strength of demand, the strength of just overall demand, and the strength of\ndemand for labor, look at inflation, look at wages. I think moving, you know, moving forward\nthe end of our taper by a few months is really—is really an appropriate thing to do. And I think,\nreally, Omicron doesn’t really have much to do with that.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Jeanna at the New York Times.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Hey, Chairman Powell. Thanks for taking our questions. I\nwonder if you could talk a little bit about what prompted your recent pivot toward greater\nwariness around inflation.\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So I guess I would go back and—you know, it’s been a\ncontinual process, really. Inflation really popped up, right? In the late spring last year. And we\nhad a view—it was very, very widely held in the forecasting community—that this would be\ntemporary. It was quite narrow, you know, a limited number of factors were causing it. And\nthere was a decent amount of evidence to support that view, that it would be temporary or\ntransitory, as we said. Certainly, we had five months of declining month on month—monthly\nreadings of inflation, but we didn’t see much in the way of progress on labor supply or on other\nsupply-side issues. Then in September, I’d say after Labor Day, we started to see—it started to\nbecome clear that this was both larger in its effect on inflation and more persistent. And, of\ncourse, I said so on many occasions, and one of the consequences of that is that we move the\ntaper forward. We moved the taper forward and we—and it’s a much faster taper than had been\nplanned. So we’ve been adapting—I’ve been saying we’re adapting our policy.\nPage 12 of 31\nDecember 15, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nSo coming to your real question, we got the ECI reading on the eve of the November\nmeeting—it was the Friday before the November meeting—and it was very high, 5.7 percent\nreading for the employment compensation index for the third quarter, not annualized, for the\nthird quarter, just before the meeting. And I thought for a second there whether we—whether we\nshould increase our taper, [We] decided to go ahead with what we had—what we had\n“socialized.” Then, right after that, we got the next Friday after the meeting, two days after the\nmeeting, we got a very strong employment report and, you know, revisions to prior readings and,\nand no increase in labor supply. And the Friday after that, we got the CPI, which was a very hot,\nhigh reading. And I, honestly, at that point, really decided that I thought we needed to—we\nneeded to look at, at speeding up the taper. And we went to work on that. So that’s, that’s really\nwhat happened. It was essentially higher inflation and faster—turns out much faster progress in\nthe labor market. Really, what’s happening is the unemployment rate is catching up—seems to\nbe catching up—with a lot of the other readings of a tight labor market, 6/10 [decline] over one\ncycle. So that’s really what happened and, you know, widely supported in the Committee today,\nas you can see—unanimous vote—but beyond that I think widely, widely supported, you know,\nthis, this move.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. If I could just follow up quickly, you noted that the ECI was one\nof the things that made you nervous, but you also said earlier that you don’t see signs that wages\nare actually factoring into inflation yet. And I guess I wonder how you think about sort of the\nwage picture as, as you’re making these assessments.\nCHAIR POWELL. Right. So—but I said—you, you quoted me correctly. It’s, it’s—so\nfar, we don’t see—wages are not a big part of the high-inflation story that we’re seeing. As you\nlook forward, let’s assume that the goods economy does sort itself out, and supply chains get\nPage 13 of 31\nDecember 15, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nworking again, and maybe there’s a rebalancing back to services and all that kind of thing. But\nwhat, what that leaves behind is the other things that can lead to persistent inflation. In\nparticular—we don’t see this yet, but if you had something where wages were persistently—\n[increases in] real wages were persistently above productivity growth, that puts upward pressure\non, on firms, and they raise prices. It would take something that was persistent and material for\nthat to happen. And we don’t see that yet. But with the kind of hot labor market readings—\nwages we’re seeing, it’s something that we’re—that we’re watching. And the other thing, of\ncourse, is, is rents, which are very important. You know, owners’ equivalent rent. That’s\nanother thing which is very economically sensitive. Unlike the things that are causing the\ninflation now, this is economically sensitive—and so would be expected to move up. And so as\nthe—as some things go down, the question is: Where will we be when we come out the other\nside of this? And we need to keep our eyes on those things.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thanks. We’ll go to Chris at the AP.\nCHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Thank you. Well, next year, you could see growth\nslowing, and you could see some disinflation, particularly if the Omicron variant does spread\nmore widely. Would you delay rate hikes in that situation? And how would you think about\nthat? And also, how would you explain rate hikes if you do follow through, in that kind of\nsituation, with inflation fading and growth slowing? How would you explain rate hikes to the\npublic, particularly those who may still be looking for work?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, as you know, you know, the SEP is not a plan. It’s not\nsomething we debate, negotiate over, or really discuss in terms of what the right answer should\nbe. People write down their, their assumptions—their assessment of appropriate policy based on\nPage 14 of 31\nDecember 15, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ntheir economic forecast. And so the median—what you’re talking about, the three rate increases,\nthat’s the median of the Committee—the median of the Committee is also that growth will be\n4 percent and then unemployment will be 3½ percent by the end of the year. So that’s a really\nstrong economy. And, of course, if the—if the economy turns out to be quite different from that,\nthen so will the rate. You know, we—no one will say, “Oh, we can’t change our policy because\nwe wrote something down in December.” No one’s ever said that or will. It will—the actual\nrate decisions we make will depend on our evolving assessment of the forecast. So, for example,\nif, if the economy were to slow down significantly, then you would expect that that would have\nan effect of slowing down rate increases. But we’d have to—you know, we look at our two\ngoals, maximum employment and price stability, and we make policy based on them, and not\nwith respect to what we wrote down in a prior SEP.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let’s go to Victoria Guida at Politico.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Chair Powell. I wanted to follow up on maximum\nemployment. So, you know, the new framework was basically designed, as I understand it, so\nthat there was a de-emphasis on guessing where inflation would pick up because of employment.\nAnd, basically, you were going to wait until you saw the whites of the eyes of inflation. And\nthat’s how you would kind of know that you reached maximum employment. So, I’m\nwondering, you know, you’ve talked a lot about the different ways that you might measure\nmaximum employment. But from what I understand, that’s still basically: The way that you\nknow that you’re there is inflation. So is that understanding correct? And how is—are those\nsignals likely to be clear right now given that you have inflation that’s caused by, you know,\nthese supply chain disruptions that might also lead to, you know, inflation in wages and those\nsorts of things? So how do you sort of, like, tease out the signal of maximum employment?\nPage 15 of 31\nDecember 15, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. Okay. So let me start by saying that the inflation that we got was not\nat all the inflation we were looking for or talking about in the framework. This was—it really\nwas a completely different thing. It was to do with, you know, strong monetary policy and fiscal\nstimulus into an economy that was recovering rapidly, and in which there were these supply-side\nbarriers which effectively led to, you know, in certain parts of the economy, what you might call\na vertical supply curve. So, you know, automobile purchases are very interest rate-sensitive, and\nyou would think demand would drive up the quantity of cars, But it can’t, because they don’t\nhave semiconductors. So, so that—it was a very different kind of inflation. This is not the\ninflation we were looking for under our framework at all. It’s nothing to do with our framework.\nAnd our—the way we’ve approached it is really nothing to do with our framework.\nBut coming to maximum employment, which is really your question. How do you know?\nSo I think you look at, you know, prices and quantities. When you—if you want to look at\nmaximum employment, you look at prices and quantities, and the main price you look at is\nwages. It’s one of the things you look at. And, you know, it’s—So I mentioned a number of\nother things. You can get to 20, if you wanted to, easily, but labor force participation, the\nunemployment rate, different age groups of—you know, prime-age labor force participation, in\nparticular, gets a lot of focus, the JOLTS data get a lot of focus. And wages, that’s, that’s really\none of the great signals. The quits rate is another one. The quits rate is really one of the very\nbest indicators, according to a lot of labor economists, because people quit because they feel like\nthey can get a better job. And there’s, you know, record amounts, historically high levels of that\ngoing on—suggesting, again, that you’ve got a very tight labor market.\nSo on wages, that’s the price indicator we look at to tell us, along with all the other data,\nwhether we’re—whether we have labor market conditions that are consistent with maximum\nPage 16 of 31\nDecember 15, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nemployment. And so that’s, that’s how we think about it. But the—one of the complications is\nthat, again, we’ve got to make policy in real time. So how do we think about that? Do we—if\nwe think we can make labor, you know, participation might move up—if we, let’s say we knew\nthat it would start to move up in two years, would we wait two years when inflation is running\nway above target? Probably not, you know, so you have to make an assessment that what’s\nmax—what is the level of maximum employment that is consistent with price stability in real\ntime is, is one way to think about it.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Just to kind of follow up on that for a second, if you do raise\ninterest rates next year and, you know, it’s—you’re not certain whether you’re at maximum\nemployment, are you all going to point—when you raise interest rates, are you going to point to\nways in which the labor market could still improve?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes. I mean, I—absolutely. I, I think—well, whether or not we—\nwhether or not we say “we’re at conditions—labor market conditions consistent with, with\nmaximum employment” next year, we would all be open and I think expect, over time, that the\nlevel of maximum employment that’s consistent with price stability would increase further over\ntime—for example, through increasing participation. So I—we would certainly—we would not,\nin any way, want to foreclose the idea that the labor market can get even better. But, again, with\ninflation as high as it is, we have to make policy in real time. We’ve got to make that assessment\nin real time.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We’ll go to Olivia from Bloomberg.\nOLIVIA ROCKEMAN. Thank you. Good afternoon, Chair Powell, and thank you for\ntaking our questions. I wanted to follow up on some of your earlier comments about labor force\nparticipation. And I wondered, what do you think needs to change in the economy to kind of get\nPage 17 of 31\nDecember 15, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\na meaningful recovery in labor force participation, and also whether running the economy hot,\nlike in the last expansion, is one way of doing that?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, the labor market is, by so many measures, hotter than it ever\nran in the last—in the last expansion, if you think about it. You know, the ratio of job openings,\nfor example, to, to vacancies is at all-time highs. Quits, the wages—all those things are, are even\nhotter. But what would it take for labor force participation to move up more? You know,\nthat’s—really, “Why is it low?” is the question. So there, there are a bunch of answers, and all\nof them probably have some, you know, some validity. Part of it will be that people—for certain\npeople, they don’t want to go back in the labor force because either they’re medically vulnerable\nor they’re not comfortable going back while COVID is still everywhere. That’s one thing. The\nlack of availability of childcare made for caretakers is certainly part of it—not just for children,\nbut for older people. It has been pointed out by many that the stock market is high, people’s\nportfolios are stronger—they may go back to being a one-income rather than a two-income\nfamily. The same thing with people’s houses. People buy—they have a mortgage, you know,\nwith leverage, and the house price increases, the equity they have in their home might have\ndoubled. And they might make—reach the same conclusion. So they’re—and people have\nsavings on their balance sheet because of forced savings because they couldn’t spend on travel\nand things like that and also because of, you know, because of government transfers.\nSo, for all of those reasons—and it’s hard to know exactly the part each of them plays—\nwe, we have a situation where we’ve had a shock to labor force participation that is not\nunwinding as quickly as, as many, as expected. And people—in effect, a good part of it is\nvoluntary. You know, people—and this is how they want to maximize their welfare and that’s,\nthat’s their, certainly their choice. In other cases, it’s something that will abate very quickly if\nPage 18 of 31\nDecember 15, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nand when the pandemic gets under control. And the longer the pandemic goes on, you know,\nmaybe the less likely that people will come back because they’re—you know, they get used to\ntheir new life and they lose contact with their old jobs. That’s, that’s what the evidence would\nsay.\nSo it’s a range of things. It isn’t that the economy lacks stimulus. You know, usually, in\nevery other expansion, it’s that there aren’t enough jobs and people can’t find jobs and, you\nknow, we’re stimulating demand and trying to get demand to come up. That’s not the problem\nhere. The problem is a supply-side problem, which—what it would take to work it out, I think\nit’s going to be time. And the number-one thing would, would really be to have the pandemic\nget under control. That’s what everyone would really like to see: What does the labor force—\nwhat does the labor market look like in a world without COVID? That would be the thing that\nwe’d really like to see but, you know, it doesn’t look like that’s coming anytime soon.\nOLIVIA ROCKEMAN. And just to quickly follow up on that: If some of the reason that\nlabor force participation isn’t back to, you know, February 2020 levels is because people are\nvoluntarily making life decisions that are different, does that make you think we’re going to end\nup at a lower rate overall?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, there’s a demographic trend underlying all of this. And we\nactually got above the demographic trend at the end of the last expansion. But—so one would\nexpect over time that labor force participation would, would move down because an aging\npopulation, the older people are, the lower their participation rate is. So you would expect that,\nthat the trend would be lower and that, over time, participation would move down.\nThe question of how much we can get back up closer to where we were in February of\n2020—and, indeed, for the year or so before that—is a good one. And, I mean, I—What we can\nPage 19 of 31\nDecember 15, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ndo is try to create the conditions. There’s a lot of good for society when you have a tight but\nstable labor market, where people are coming in, they’re getting into the labor force, they’re\ngetting paid well. In the labor market we had before, we had, you know—the biggest wage\nincreases were going to people at the bottom end of the wage spectrum for the last couple of\nyears. There were just a lot of really desirable aspects of a labor market like that. Higher\nparticipation is one of them. And we’d love to get back there. But, again, ultimately, we have\nthe tools that we have, which are essentially to stimulate demand and also to control inflation. I\nmean, really, it might be—one of the two big threats to getting back to maximum employment is\nactually high inflation, because, to get back to where we were, the evidence grows that it’s going\nto take some time. And what we need is another long expansion, like the ones we’ve been\nhaving. Over the last 40 years, we’ve had, I think, three of the four longest in our recorded\nhistory, including the last one, which was the longest in our recorded history. That’s what it\nwould really take to get back to the kind of labor market we’d like to see. And to have that\nhappen, we need to make sure that we maintain price stability.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Okay, let’s go to Edward Lawrence at Fox.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thanks. Thanks, Michelle, and thanks for taking the question,\nChair Powell. So I was looking at the consensus data for estimated monthly changes on sales.\nAnd what you’re seeing is fewer people spending at restaurants and drinking places, more people\nspending at grocery stores. You see electronic sales down 4.6 percent month over month, also\ndepartment store sales down 5.4 percent month over month. How concerned or what is your\nlevel of concern the consumer may be turning away from this economy or pulling back because\nof inflation, the virus, or something else? Thank you.\nPage 20 of 31\nDecember 15, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. We see consumer expense as very strong in this quarter. I don’t\nknow, Edward, whether you’re talking about more shopping online versus shopping in the store,\nbut consumer demand is very strong, incomes are very strong, you know, because people are\ngoing back to work and they’re getting wage increases. Admittedly, some of the wage increases\nis being eaten away by inflation. But, nonetheless, incomes, overall, are going up really\nsignificantly because of increased employment and spending is—has been strong. There may be\nsomething in the seasonality that this year’s holiday spending may have been pulled forward.\nAnd, of course, there may be effects from, from Delta and there might be going forward from\nOmicron. But fundamentally, though, the consumer is really healthy, and we expect personal\nconsumption expenditures to be pretty strong in the fourth quarter.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Okay, let’s go to Mike at Bloomberg.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Mr. Chairman, the median forecast for inflation in this month’s or\nthis meeting’s economic projections has been revised up significantly for 2021 but barely moved\nfor 2022 and 2023. You’ve said you expect inflation to fall significantly. Is that because you’re\ngoing to raise interest rates or because the virus is going to fade and the effects are going to fade?\nIn other words, is it a question of when, not if, you raise interest rates? And does it suggest that\nmaybe your critics are correct and you might be afraid you’re “behind the curve”?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, actually, I’m looking at the SEP here, and the median forecasts\nfor core and headline inflation did move up by 4/10 each. So that’s a significant—you know, in\nan SEP, that’s a pretty significant move up. You know, it’s, it’s based on both of those things, I\nsuppose. I do think there’s a broad expectation among forecasters, including our own, that the\nbottlenecks will alleviate sometime over the course of this year. If you look at where Blue Chip\nforecasts are—which is, you know, a group of well-resourced, large forecasting operations with a\nPage 21 of 31\nDecember 15, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nlong track record—they’ll show inflation coming back down significantly toward the back-end\nof next year.\nI would say, though, as well that our policy should begin to have an effect. There will be\na lag, but it should begin to have an effect on that as well. And, you know, that’s the most likely\ncase.\nI guess what—the thing I would want to say, though, is we can’t act as though that’s a\ncertainty, and we’re not going to act as though that’s a certainty. There’s a real risk now, we\nbelieve, I believe, that inflation may be more persistent and that may be putting inflation\nexpectations under pressure, and that the risk of higher inflation becoming entrenched has\nincreased. It’s certainly increased. I don’t think it’s high at this moment, but I think it’s\nincreased. And I think that’s part of the reason behind our move today. [It] is to put ourselves in\na position to be able to deal with that risk. And I think we are in a position to deal with that risk.\nWe need to see more data. We need to see how the inflation data and the—all the data evolve in\ncoming months, but we are prepared to, you know, to use our tools to make sure that higher\ninflation doesn’t get entrenched. For one reason, as I—as I just mentioned, it’s one of the two\nbig threats, the other being the pandemic itself, to getting back to maximum employment.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Michael Derby at the Wall Street Journal.\nMICHAEL DERBY. Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. So as the Fed shifts\ntowards an accelerated taper, I wonder what your read is on financial-stability risks right now. I\nmean, these periods can be—you know, it seems like the taper process has gone fairly smooth so\nfar. But, you know, what do you see in terms of stability risks? Are there any parts of the\nfinancial sector that concern you right now? And are there any significant systemic issues that\nare on your radar, you know, maybe from the cryptocurrency sector or something like that?\nPage 22 of 31\nDecember 15, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, we have—we have had now for a decade and more a\nfour-part financial stability framework that we use so we can—we can hold ourselves to the\nsame kind of framework and, you know, not just treat each event individually. And there are\nfour key areas: asset valuations, debt owed by households and businesses, funding risk, and\nleverage among financial institutions. So I would say asset valuations—I’m going to go really\nsuperficially here, but asset valuations are somewhat elevated, I would say. Debt owed by\nbusinesses, you know, and households—households are in very strong financial shape.\nBusinesses actually have a lot of debt, but their default rates are very, very low. But,\nnonetheless, it’s something we’re watching. Funding risk is, by and large, low among, among\nfinancial institutions. But we do see money market funds as a vulnerability and, and, you know,\nwould applaud the SEC’s action this week. Leverage among financial institutions is low, in the\nsense that [their] capital is high. So, overall, you know, financial stability, that’s how—I\nwouldn’t make an overall characteristic, but we break it down into those pieces.\nIn terms of the things, you know, that we’re—that we’re looking for, looking at, you\nknow, it’s the—it’s the things we’ve already talked about, to some extent. It’s, it’s the\nemergence of a new variant that could, you know, that could lead to significant economic—if\nthere were to be a variant, for example, [and if] that were quite resistant to vaccines, it could\nhave another significant effect on the economy. We don’t see that. We don’t have any basis for\nthinking that the new variant that we have is that one, but it’s certainly one we’re looking at. I\nwould say, you know, cyber risk, the risk of a successful cyberattack, is, for me, you know,\nalways the most—you know, one that would be very difficult to deal with. I think we know how\nto deal with bad loans and things like that. I think more—a cyberattack that were to take down a\nmajor financial institution or financial market utility would be a really significant financial\nPage 23 of 31\nDecember 15, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nstability risk that we haven’t actually faced yet. So I could go on with a list of “horribles,” but I\nthink that’s a decent picture of where I would start.\nMICHAEL DERBY. How about the cryptocurrency issues? Anything that worries you\nthere that’s going on in there in terms of—you know, obviously a lot’s happening in that sector.\nDoes that concern you at all?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, I think the concerns there are not so much current\nfinancial-stability concerns. I, of course, would support the, the views expressed in the\nPresident’s Working Group report on stablecoins. Stablecoins can certainly be a useful,\nefficient, consumer-serving, part of the financial system, if they’re properly regulated. And,\nright now, they aren’t. And, and they have the potential to scale [up], particularly if they were to\nbe, you know, associated with one of the very large tech networks that exist and you could have\na payment network that was immediately systemically important—close to immediately\nsystemically important that didn’t have appropriate regulation and protections. The public relies\non the government—and [on] the Fed, in particular—to make sure that the payment system is\nsafe and reliable, as well as the dollar and—you know, to provide a safe and reliable trusted\ncurrency. So—but I do think those are longer term.\nIn terms of, you know, the more—the cryptocurrencies, you know, that are really\nspeculative assets, I don’t see them as a financial-stability concern at the moment. I do think\nthey are risky, they’re not backed by anything, and I think there’s big consumer—issues for\nconsumers who may or may not understand what they’re getting. And there’s certainly\ndevelopments in the—in the markets that are worth following, which are really not in our\njurisdiction, but things like, you know, the kind of leverage that’s built into and those sorts of\nthings is certainly worth, worth watching.\nPage 24 of 31\nDecember 15, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Nancy Marshall-Genzer at Marketplace.\nNANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Chair Powell. Hi, Chair Powell, thanks for the\nquestion. Going back to inflation, is the Fed “behind the curve” on getting inflation under\ncontrol?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I would say this. I actually think we are well positioned to deal\nwith, with what’s coming, with the range of plausible outcomes that can come. I do. And I think\nif you look at how we got here, I do think we’ve, we’ve been adapting to the incoming data,\nreally all the way along, and, you know, noticing and calling out that, that the—both the effects\nand the persistence of inflation of bottlenecks and labor shortages and things like that. So we’ve\nbeen calling out the fact that those were becoming longer, and more persistent, and larger. And\nnow we’re in a position where we’re ending our taper within the next—well, by March, in two\nmeetings, and we’ll be in a position to raise interest rates as and when we think it’s appropriate.\nAnd we will, if that—to the extent that’s appropriate. At the same time, we’re going to be seeing\na few more months of data. I don’t actually think we’re out of position now. I think this was an\nimportant move for us to make. I think that the data that we got toward the end of the fall was\na—was a really strong signal that inflation is more persistent and higher—and that the risk of it\nremaining higher for longer has grown. And I think we’re reacting to that now. And we’ll\ncontinue to adapt our policy. So I wouldn’t look at it that we’re “behind the curve.” I would\nlook at it that we’re actually in position now to take the steps that we’ll need to take, you know,\nin a thoughtful manner to address all of the issues, including that of, of too-high inflation.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Evan at Market News.\nEVAN RYSER. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you. I was wondering if we should still be\nseeing the taper and interest rate hikes as separate. And, secondly, in the last cycle, the Fed\nPage 25 of 31\nDecember 15, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nstarted shrinking the balance sheet when short-term interest rates were about 1 to 1¼ percent\nrange. Do you think the FOMC might be able to potentially start running off assets before that\nthis time?\nCHAIR POWELL. Are they separate? So our interest rate—I mean, they are separate\ntools. So the—you know, the, the asset purchases are a separate tool from interest rates.\nStopping asset purchases does not remove accommodation. It just stops adding further\naccommodation. Whereas raising interest rates starts to remove accommodation from what is a\nhighly accommodative stance. You know, the extent to which they’ll be separated in time is, is\nsomething we haven’t really discussed at the Committee [meetings] yet. We will be discussing\nthat, obviously, in coming meetings. I don’t think that, that—the last cycle, there was quite a\nlong separation before interest rates. I don’t think that’s at all likely in this cycle. We’re in a\nvery, very different place with high inflation, strong growth, a really strong economy. You\nknow, that—as I mentioned, the SEP medians are for 4 percent growth next year, 3½ percent—\n3½ percent unemployment at the end of the year, and the, the—you know, headline inflation of\n2.6 percent next year, core at 2.7. So this is a strong economy, one in which it’s appropriate for,\nfor interest rate hikes. So they’re separate, I would say. Your—sorry, your second\nquestion was?\nEVAN RYSER. My second question was about runoff.\nCHAIR POWELL. Runoff.\nEVAN RYSER. In the last cycle.\nCHAIR POWELL. So, you know, with the balance sheet, we did have a balance sheet\ndiscussion, sort of a prelim—a first, first discussion of balance sheet issues today, [balance] sheet\nissues, at our meeting this week. We’ll have another at the next meeting and another at the\nPage 26 of 31\nDecember 15, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nmeeting after that I suspect. These are interesting issues to discuss. [We] didn’t make any\ndecisions today. We looked back at what happened in the last cycle, and people thought that was\ninteresting and informative. And—but to one degree or another, people noted that this is just a\ndifferent situation, and those differences should inform the decisions we make about the balance\nsheet this time. So [we] haven’t made any decisions at all about, about when runoff would start,\nbut we’re—we’ll be continuing to—you know, in relation to when either liftoff happens or the\nend of the taper. But those are exactly the decisions we’ll be turning to in coming meetings.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We’ll go to Scott Horsley at NPR.\nSCOTT HORSLEY. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. I think you said a few minutes ago that the\ninflation that we got during the pandemic was not the inflation that we—that you anticipated\nwhen you crafted the framework. And you described it as a collision of a lot of monetary and\nfiscal stimulus with these supply-side hiccups. Does that mean the stimulus was mistaken, or is\nthe inflation just a consequence of—that we have to put up with because of that?\nCHAIR POWELL. No, I’m not expressing any judgment about, about the stimulus in, in\nthat comment. What I’m saying is, there’s a—there’s a sense among some that “you wanted\ninflation, this is what you wanted, how do you like it?,” you know? And the truth is, this is not\nthe inflation that we were—what we were talking about in the—in the framework was inflation\nthat comes from a tight labor market, right? So we had 3½ percent unemployment for a period,\nand we had inflation that was just barely getting to 2 percent. And I—you know, I think, in that\nsetting, our thinking was, we can afford to wait to raise rates until we see actual inflation rather\nthan [acting] preemptive[ly] because, you know, no one had seen what 3½ percent\nunemployment would look like—with high labor force participation, by the way. No one had\nseen what it would look—really look like for an extended period, for decades. And we didn’t\nPage 27 of 31\nDecember 15, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nknow what the inflationary implications were. It turned out there was barely 2 percent\ninflation—and no sense that it was gaining momentum and that kind of thing. So we\nincorporated that into our framework.\nThis is something completely different. You know, that’s a situation where you had a\nvery, very high level of employment and low inflation. This is literally the opposite. Or, you\nknow, it has been the opposite, where we have very high inflation and we’ve had it since the\nlabor market was in terrible shape. It had nothing—so far, this inflation has really nothing to do\nwith tightness in the labor market. It does have to do with, with strong demand, and strong\ndemand was supported by the Fed, it was supported by Congress. I’m not making any judgments\non Congress, it’s not my job. But I will just say, we’re coming out of a, you know, what we\ncertainly hope will be a once in a lifetime, certainly historic—the first really global modern\npandemic—which looked at the beginning like it might cause a global depression. And, you\nknow, so we threw a lot of support at it [the economy]. And what’s coming out now is, is, you\nknow, really strong growth, really strong demand, high incomes, and all that kind of thing. You\nknow, people will judge in 25 years whether we—whether we overdid it or not, but, you know,\nthe reality is, we are where we are. And, you know, we think our policy is, is the right one for\nthe situation that we’re in.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let’s go to Brian Cheung.\nBRIAN CHEUNG. Hi, Chairman Powell. Wanted to ask about the bond markets. When\nyou see the 10-year at 146 basis points, do you have any sort of concerns about an environment\nby which you might be hiking interest rates into? Would you prefer the curve be a little bit\nsteeper? What are you gleaning from the bond market actions over the last six weeks?\nPage 28 of 31\nDecember 15, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. So I, I think the short-end actions are easy to understand, which is,\nyou know, they’re basically very [monetary] policy-sensitive rates at the short end, and it makes\nsense that it’s reacting to changes in expectations for policy. I think a lot of things go into the,\nyou know, the long rates. And the place I would start is just look at global sovereign yields\naround the world. Look at JGBs, look at bunds, and they’re so much lower. You can get—you\ncan get, you know, a much higher yield on U.S. Treasuries by buying USTs rather than bunds\nand you can—you can hedge, hedge the currency risk back into yen, back into euros and still be\nway ahead. So, in a way, it’s not surprising that there’s a lot of demand for, for U.S. sovereigns\nin a world—you know, in a risk-free world where, where there’s so much—they’re yielding so\nmuch more than bunds are, than JGBs. So that’s, that’s a big part of it.\nI also think, you know, there, there may be some assessment in there of what the neutral\nrate is or what the terminal rate is. I don’t know about that. But—and I would just say that we,\nyou know, we write down our own estimates of the—of the terminal rate or the neutral rate of\ninterest. Those are highly uncertain. And, you know, we’ll make policy based on what we’re\nseeing in the economy rather than based on what a neutral—what a model might say the neutral\nrate is. We, we all had the experience of the last cycle, where we all, through that cycle, were\ntrying to estimate what the neutral rate was, and it turned out—you know, I think we learned a\nlot from seeing what happens. We ended up cutting rates three times after raising them to 2¼ to\n2½ percent. So I’m not troubled by where the long bond [rate] is. You know, I see that it’s low.\nYou know, I mean, we’re really focused on broader financial conditions, [and] we’re focused on\nmaximum employment and price stability.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. For the last question, we’ll go to Greg Robb.\nPage 29 of 31\nDecember 15, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nGREG ROBB. Thank you very much. Chair Powell, I was wondering if—I wanted to\ngive you the opportunity to talk about something that I’ve heard that’s been discussed—that, you\nknow, your pivot towards a tighter policy, hawkish policy stance had something to do with the\ntiming of your renomination by the President. Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure, I’d be happy to talk about that. So, as I mentioned, we got the\nECI reading just before the November meeting. We got the labor market report two days after\nthe meeting. And then, one week after that, I think on the 12th of November, we got the CPI\nreading. It was really the CPI reading, in concert with those two, and I, I just came to the view\nover that weekend that we needed to speed up the taper. And we started working on that. That's\na full 10 days or so before the President made a decision of renominating me. So, honestly, it\nhad—it had nothing to do with that at all. And I just thought this is what we got to do. My\ncolleagues were out talking about the—a faster taper. And that doesn’t happen by accident.\nThey were out talking about a faster taper before the President made his decision. So it’s a\ndecision that effectively was in—more than in train and, you know, to the point where people\nwere talking about it publicly. So that’s what happened. And it had absolutely nothing to do\nwith it whatsoever. We’re always going to just do what we think is the right thing, and I\ncertainly will always just do what I think the right thing is for the economy and for the people\nthat we serve.\nGREG ROBB. Just a quick follow-up. I guess that some people are saying that it was\nthe, you know, the stimulus in March that was sort of over—we didn’t really need all that\nstimulus, and that there was talk even then that that would be a mistake and it would lead to\nhigher inflation. And perhaps that you didn’t push back as much as you might have otherwise.\nPage 30 of 31\nDecember 15, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. I didn’t push back at all. And the reason I didn’t—and there was\nno—there was lots of talk about that, but not from the Fed, because that is not our job. We are\nnot the CBO, and we’re not elected by anybody. So we take fiscal policy as it arrives at our front\ndoor, and we don’t comment—you know, we make our own assessments inside the Fed, but it’s\nreally not our role. And I think, very important, that we stay out of that business, no matter\nwho’s in the White House, who’s in Congress. It’s just—it’s just not our job and it’s something\nwe avoid pretty, pretty assiduously.\nGREG ROBB. Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, everyone.\nPage 31 of 31"

    "press_conf": "January 26, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nTranscript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference\nJanuary 26, 2022\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed\nto achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and\nprice stability.\nToday, in support of these goals, the Federal Open Market Committee kept its policy\ninterest rate near zero and stated its expectation that an increase in this rate would soon be\nappropriate. The Committee also agreed to continue reducing its net asset purchases on the\nschedule we announced in December—bringing them to an end in early March. As I will\nexplain, against a backdrop of elevated inflation and a strong labor market, our policy has been\nadapting to the evolving economic environment, and it will continue to do so.\nEconomic activity expanded at a robust pace last year, reflecting progress on vaccinations\nand the reopening of the economy, fiscal and monetary policy support, and the healthy financial\npositions of households and businesses. Indeed, the economy has shown great strength and\nresilience in the face of the ongoing pandemic. The recent sharp rise in COVID cases associated\nwith the Omicron variant will surely weigh on economic growth this quarter. High-frequency\nindicators point to reduced spending in COVID-sensitive sectors, such as travel and restaurants.\nAnd activity more broadly may also be affected as many workers are unable to report for work\nbecause of illness, quarantines, or caregiving needs.\nFortunately, health experts are finding that the Omicron variant has not been as virulent\nas previous strains of the virus, and they expect that cases will drop off rapidly. If the wave\npasses quickly, the economic effects should as well, and we would see a return to strong growth.\nThat said, the implications for the economy remain uncertain. And we have not lost sight of the\nPage 1 of 28\nJanuary 26, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nfact that for many afflicted individuals and families, and for the health-care workers on the front\nlines, the virus continues to cause great hardship.\nThe labor market has made remarkable progress and, by many measures, is very strong.\nJob gains have been solid in recent months, averaging 365,000 per month over the past three\nmonths. Over the past year, payroll employment has risen by 6.4 million jobs. The\nunemployment rate has declined sharply, falling 2 percentage points over the past six months to\nreach 3.9 percent in December. The improvements in labor market conditions have been\nwidespread, including for workers at the lower end of the wage distribution, as well as for\nAfrican Americans and Hispanics.\nLabor demand remains historically strong. With constraints on labor supply, employers\nare having difficulties filling job openings, and wages are rising at their fastest pace in many\nyears. While labor force participation has edged up, it remains subdued, in part reflecting the\naging of the population and retirements. In addition, some who would otherwise would be\nseeking work report that they are out of the labor force because of factors related to the\npandemic, including caregiving needs and ongoing concerns about the virus. The current wave\nof the virus may well prolong these effects. Over time, there are good reasons to expect some\nfurther improvements in participation and employment.\nInflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. Supply and demand\nimbalances related to the pandemic and [to] the reopening of the economy have continued to\ncontribute to elevated levels of inflation. In particular, bottlenecks and supply constraints are\nlimiting how quickly production can respond to higher demand in the near term. These problems\nhave been larger and longer lasting than anticipated, exacerbated by waves of the virus.\nPage 2 of 28\nJanuary 26, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nWhile the drivers of higher inflation have been predominantly connected to the\ndislocations caused by the pandemic, price increases have now spread to a broader range of\ngoods and services. Wages have also risen briskly, and we are attentive to the risks that\npersistent real wage growth in excess of productivity [growth] could put upward pressure on\ninflation. Like most forecasters, we continue to expect inflation to decline over the course of\nthe year.\nWe understand that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least\nable to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. In addition, we\nbelieve that the best thing we can do to support continued labor market gains is to promote a long\nexpansion, and that will require price stability. We are committed to our price-stability goal.\nWe will use our tools both to support the economy and a strong labor market and to prevent\nhigher inflation from becoming entrenched. And we’ll be watching carefully to see whether the\neconomy is evolving in line with expectations.\nThe Fed’s monetary policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote\nmaximum employment and stable prices for the American people. As I noted, the Committee\nleft the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged and reaffirmed our plan, announced in\nDecember, to end asset purchases in early March. In light of the remarkable progress we’ve seen\nin the labor market and inflation that is well above our 2 percent longer-run goal, the economy\nno longer needs sustained high levels of monetary policy support. That is why we are phasing\nout our asset purchases and why we expect it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for\nthe federal funds rate.\nOf course, the economic outlook remains highly uncertain. Making appropriate monetary\npolicy in this environment requires humility, recognizing that the economy evolves in\nPage 3 of 28\nJanuary 26, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nunexpected ways. We’ll need to be nimble so that we can respond to the full range of plausible\noutcomes. With this in mind, we will remain attentive to risks, including the risk that high\ninflation is more persistent than expected, and are prepared to respond as appropriate to achieve\nour goals.\nTo provide greater clarity about our approach for reducing the size of the Federal\nReserve’s balance sheet, today the Committee issued a set of principles that will provide a\nfoundation for our future decisions. [In] these high-level principles, [we] clarify that the federal\nfunds rate is our primary means of adjusting monetary policy and that reducing our balance sheet\nwill occur after the process of raising interest rates has begun. Reductions will occur over time\nin a predictable manner primarily through adjustments to reinvestments so that securities roll off\nour balance sheet. Over time, we intend to hold securities in the amounts needed for our ample-\nreserves operating framework, and in the longer run, we envision holding primarily Treasury\nsecurities.\nOur decisions to reduce our balance sheet will be guided by our maximum-employment\nand price-stability goals. In that regard, we will be prepared to adjust any of the details of our\napproach to balance sheet management in light of economic and financial developments. The\nCommittee has not made decisions regarding the specific timing, pace, or other details of\nshrinking the balance sheet. And we will discuss these matters in upcoming meetings and\nprovide additional information at the appropriate time.\nTo conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and\nbusinesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the\nFederal Reserve will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-\nstability goals. Thank you. I look forward to your questions.\nPage 4 of 28\nJanuary 26, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. For the first question, we’ll go to Chris Rugaber at the\nAssociated Press.\nCHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Thanks, Michelle. And thank you, Chair Powell. So it’s\nexpected that the Fed will hike rates perhaps every other meeting, but certainly in the past, the\nFed has hiked at every meeting. So I just wanted to ask, you know, are rate hikes at consecutive\nmeetings on the table this year? Is every meeting a live—a live meeting? And, on that note,\nwould the Fed consider front-loading some of its rate hikes, even if it doesn’t raise at every\nmeeting? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Thanks. So, as I—as I referred to in my opening statement, it’s—it\nis not possible to predict with much confidence exactly what path for our policy rate is going to\nprove appropriate. And so, at this time, we haven’t made any decisions about the path of policy.\nAnd I stress again that we’ll be humble and nimble. We’re going to have to navigate\ncrosscurrents and actually two-sided risks now. So—and, and I’ll say also that we’re going to be\nguided by the data. In fact, what I’ll say is that we’re going to be led by the incoming data and\nthe evolving outlook, which we’ll try to communicate as clearly as possible, moving steadily and\ntransparency—transparently.\nSo more to your question, we know that the economy is in a very different place than it\nwas when we began raising rates in 2015. Specifically, the economy is now much stronger. The\nlabor market is far stronger. Inflation is running well above our 2 percent target, much higher\nthan it was at that time. And these differences are likely to have important implications for the\nappropriate pace of policy adjustments. Beyond that, we haven’t made any decisions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let’s go to Victoria Guida at Politico.\nPage 5 of 28\nJanuary 26, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Chair Powell. I wanted to ask, you were talking about the\nhealth of the labor market. And I’m curious whether you would characterize where we’re at\nright now as maximum employment. And also, along those same lines, obviously rate hikes\n[are] on the table this year, do you think that the Fed can raise rates, bring inflation under control\nwithout hurting jobs and wages?\nCHAIR POWELL. Sorry. Just getting both, both parts of your question written down.\nSo I would say—and this view is widely held on the Committee—that both sides of the mandate\nare calling for us to move steadily away from the very highly accommodative policies we put in\nplace during the challenging economic conditions that the economy faced earlier in the\npandemic. And I would say that most FOMC participants agree that labor market conditions are\nconsistent with maximum employment in the sense of the highest level of employment that is\nconsistent with price stability. And that is—that is my personal view. And, and, again, very\nbroad support on the Committee for the judgment that it will soon be appropriate to raise the\ntarget range for the federal funds rate.\nThe other thing is, maximum employment will, will evolve over time and through the\ncourse of the business cycle. In the particular situation we’re in now, it may well increase.\nMax—the level of maximum—of employment that’s consistent with stable prices may increase.\nAnd we hope that it will, as more people come back into the labor market, as participation\ngradually rises. And the policy path that we’re broadly contemplating would be supportive of\nthat comment—that outcome as well.\nSo the thing about the labor market right now is that there are—there are many millions\nof, of more job openings than there are unemployed people. So you ask whether we can—\nwhether we can raise rates and, and move to less accommodative, and even tight, financial\nPage 6 of 28\nJanuary 26, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nconditions without hurting the labor market. I think there’s quite a bit of room to raise interest\nrates without threatening the labor market. This is, by so many measures, a historically tight\nlabor market. Record levels of job openings, of quits. Wages are moving up at the highest pace\nthey have in decades. If you look at surveys of workers, they find jobs plentiful. Look at\nsurveys of companies—they find workers scarce. And all of those readings are at levels, really,\nthat we haven’t seen in a long time—and, in some cases, ever. So this is a very, very strong\nlabor market, and my strong sense is that we can—we can—we can move rates up without,\nwithout having to, you know, severely undermine it.\nI also would point out that there are—there are other forces at work this year, which\nshould also help bring down inflation, we hope, including improvement on the supply side,\nwhich will ultimately come. The timing and pace of that are uncertain. And also, fiscal policy is\ngoing to be less supportive of, of growth this year—not of the level of economic activity, but the\nfiscal impulse to growth will be significantly lower. So there are multiple forces—which should\nbe working over the course of the year for inflation to come down. We do realize that the timing\nand pace of that are, are highly uncertain and that inflation has persisted longer than we—than\nwe thought. And, of course, we’re prepared to use our tools to assure that higher inflation does\nnot become entrenched.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let’s go to Nick Timiraos at the Wall Street Journal.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Good afternoon, Chair Powell. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street\nJournal. I, I have a couple of questions on the balance sheet. The statement on the balance sheet\ntoday calls for “significantly reducing” your holdings. What does that mean? And then, apart\nfrom moving sooner and faster to shrink the holdings, are there any other ways in which you and\nyour colleagues are seriously thinking about recalibrating this process? And, finally, how much\nPage 7 of 28\nJanuary 26, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ndisagreement is there around how you should use this tool, including active sales rather than\npassive sales or changes in the composition of reinvestments? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So I’m afraid to tell you that those are all great questions, and they’re\nquestions that the Committee is just turning to now. So we had—we had a discussion, as you\nknow, at the last meeting, an introductory discussion of the balance sheet and a teeing up of the\nissues. At this meeting, we’ve gone through and carefully put together a set of principles at a\nhigh level. And those are meant to guide the actual decisions we’ll make about the pace and\nabout all of the questions that you’re, you’re asking.\nAnd I expect that this process will, will be something that we spend time on in coming\nmeetings. I can’t tell you how many. I can’t tell you how long it will take. But—and then, you\nknow, at the appropriate time, we’ll provide additional information. So I did—the last cycle\nwhen we—when we went through balance sheet issues, we did find that over, over the course of\ntwo or three meetings, for example, we did come to interesting and better answers, we thought.\nSo we’re just in that process now. And at the next meeting, we’ll be turning to, you know, more\nof the details that you’re—that you’re asking about.\nI would say this. The balance sheet is, is much bigger. I’d say it has a shorter duration\nthan the last time. And the economy’s much stronger, and inflation is much higher. So—and I\nthink that leads you to—and I said, I’ve said this—being willing to move sooner than we did the\nlast time and also perhaps faster. But beyond that, it’s really—it’s really not appropriate for me\nto speculate exactly what that would be. And, and—but I would point you to principle number\none, which is “the Committee views changes in the target range for the federal funds rate as its\nprimary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy.” So we do want the federal funds\nrate—we, we want to operationalize that [as the primary means]. And we want the balance sheet\nPage 8 of 28\nJanuary 26, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nto be declining in a predictable manner, and we want it to be declining primarily by adjusting\nreinvestments.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. So, if I could follow on that, raising rates and reducing the balance\nsheet both restrain the economy, both tighten monetary policy. How should we think about the\nrelationship between the two? For example, how much passive runoff is equal to every\n¼ percentage point increase in your benchmark rate?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, again, we think of the balance sheet as, as moving in a\npredictable manner, sort of in the background, and that the active tool meeting to meeting is not\nboth of them, it’s the federal funds rate. There are—there are rules of thumb—I’m reluctant to\nland on one of them—that, that equate this. And—but there’s also an element of, of uncertainty\naround the balance sheet. I think we have a much better sense, frankly, of how rate increases\naffect financial conditions and, hence, economic conditions. Balance sheet [policy] is, is still a\nrelatively new thing for, for the markets and for us, so we’re less certain about that.\nSo, again, our—I think our—the pattern we’ll follow is to—is to arrive at a, you know, a\ntiming and a pace and composition and all those things and then announce that with advance\nnotice, and, and it will—it will start in the background. And then we’ll look to have that just\nrunning in the background and have—and have the interest rates, again, be the active tool of\nmonetary policy. That’s, that’s at least the plan. I can’t tell you much more about any of the—\nany of the very good issues about size, pace, composition, those sorts of things. But we’ll be\nturning to all of those at coming meetings.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thanks. Now we’ll go to Neil Irwin.\nPage 9 of 28\nJanuary 26, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nNEIL IRWIN. Thank you, Chair Powell. It’s Neil Irwin from Axios. Glad to be back.\nSir, I was wondering if the volatility we’ve seen in financial markets in the last few weeks strikes\nyou as anything alarming or that might affect the trajectory of policy. Conversely, to the degree\nthat financial conditions have tightened some, might that be desirable in some ways in achieving\nyour, your tightening goals?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, as you know, the ultimate focus that we have is on the real\neconomy: maximum employment and price stability. And financial conditions matter to the\nextent that they have implications for achieving the dual mandate. And you also know that we,\nwe look at broader financial conditions, not one or two things, one or two markets. And what\nwe’re always asking ourselves is, are we seeing changes that are both persistent and material\nenough that—of a change in financial conditions—that they are inconsistent with the\nachievement of our goals? So that’s how we’re looking at that. And I don’t want to comment on\ntoday’s financial conditions broadly, but we’re not looking at any one market or, or so. So that’s\nhow we’re thinking.\nIn terms of what we’ve seen, I would say this. We, you know, we said at our last meeting\nwe published the Summary of Economic Projections, the median of which—the median\nparticipant expected three rate increases this year. And, you know, it’s six weeks, seven weeks\nlater now. And you have seen that our communication channel with the markets is working.\nMarkets are, are now pricing in a number of rate increases. Surveys show that market\nparticipants are expecting a balance sheet runoff to begin, you know, at the appropriate time,\nsometime later this year perhaps. We haven’t made that decision yet. So we, we feel like the\ncommunications we have with market participants and with the general public are working and\nPage 10 of 28\nJanuary 26, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthat financial conditions are reflecting in advance the decisions that we make. And monetary\npolicy works significantly through expectations. So that, that in and of itself is appropriate.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let’s go to Howard Schneider.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. You know, for a year or so—Hi. Thanks, Chair Powell.\nHoward Schneider with Reuters. So for a year now, the statements referenced the benchmarks\nfor this initial interest rate increase. Now that we’re approaching that moment, what are the\nbenchmarks going to be for subsequent rate increases? I know you can’t stipulate the path, but\nhow should we think about the criteria for the next step and the next step?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, you’re right. We haven’t got—we haven’t gotten to that point\nyet. We haven’t made a decision yet, and we’ll make that decision at the March meeting. We’ll\nmake a decision whether to raise the federal funds rate. I would say that the Committee is, is of a\nmind to, to raise the federal funds rate at the March meeting, assuming that conditions are\nappropriate for doing so. We have—we have our eyes on, on the risks, particularly around the\nworld. But we do expect some softening in the economy from Omicron, but we think that that\nshould be temporary. And we think that the economy should—the underlying strength of the\neconomy should, you know, should, should—show through fairly quickly after that.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. If I could follow just on a related question, the December\nSEPs had this copacetic sort of set of circumstances where inflation comes down without the\nfederal funds rate ever getting over the estimate of neutral. Given developments since then, do\nyou still think that’s a credible narrative for the ultimate path of policy?\nCHAIR POWELL. I think the path is highly uncertain and that we’re committed to using\nour tools to make sure that inflation, high inflation that we’re seeing, does not become\nentrenched. So a number of factors would be—it’s not just monetary policy—a number of\nPage 11 of 28\nJanuary 26, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nfactors are supporting a decline in inflation, as I mentioned. Fiscal policy will be—will provide\nsignificantly less of an impulse to growth. We do expect this year—although we do expect now\nthat it will come slower than, than we had expected and hoped—that there will be relief on the\nsupply side. So that, too, should—should lower the supply-side barriers, which are a big part of\nthe story of why inflation is high. In addition, monetary policy will be becoming significantly\nless accommodative.\nSo the question is—you know, we’ll, we’ll be asking this question all year long, and that\nwill be, are things turning out as we expect? There’s a case that, for whatever reason, the\neconomy slows more and inflation slows more than expected; we’ll react to that. If, instead, we\nsee inflation at a higher level or a more persistent level, then we’ll react to that. And, again,\nwe’re, we’re well aware that this is a different economy than—than existed during the last\ntightening cycle, and our policy is going to reflect those differences.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let’s go to Jeanna Smialek. Let’s go to Jeanna. [No\nresponse] Okay. Let’s go to Steve Liesman.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Thank you, Michelle. And thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nMr. Chairman, I have one sort of technical question and one question on principle. The\ntechnical question is, if, if you’re going to discuss balance sheet at the next upcoming meetings\nand you won’t begin balance sheet reduction until after you begin rate hikes, it seems to\ntechnically mean that you won’t or can’t begin balance sheet reduction until the summer. Is that\ncorrect? That’s the first thing.\nSecond of all, you suggested that, that the—with balance sheet running in the\nbackground—that you would possibly be raising rates and running off the balance sheet at the\nPage 12 of 28\nJanuary 26, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nsame time. That’s sort of the technical question part of it. The principal question I have is, you\nsaid it’s going to be running in the background. But the statement on the balance sheet principles\nsays “the Committee is prepared to adjust any of the details of its approach” based on “economic\nand financial developments,” which suggests there’s something of a reaction function associated\nto the balance sheet and it won’t be running in the background. So can you give us any sense of\nthe discussion or staff presentation on what is the reaction function surrounding the balance\nsheet? Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. So let me—let me—let me start by talking about that last paragraph.\nSo you’ll remember during the last cycle that this process of building up and then shrinking the\nbalance sheet is a complicated one, and it involves, inevitably, surprises. And so during, during\nthe years, during the prior cycle, we amended our balance sheet principles a number of times.\nNow, we didn’t intend to do that. It just—events required us to do so. So we got a pretty robust\nparagraph there that says we’re free to do this at any time. And it doesn’t mean we’re going to,\nbut if the situation turns out to be different than we had thought, we’re not going to be—we’re\nnot going to stick with something that isn’t working. That’s all that’s saying. It’s meant to be\nquite a general statement rather than a, a hint.\nSo, I mean, I like to think that our, you know, our philosophy of the balance sheet is, is\nembodied in these principles. So, you know, the idea that, for example, the federal funds rate is\nthe primary means of adjusting the stance of policy, that we’ll use—determine the timing and\npace of reducing the size of the balance sheet to foster the dual mandate, that we’ll begin to\nreduce the size after we begin the process of raising rates, and on and on like that. I mean, that—\nthose are all the things that, that try to describe how we will proceed.\nPage 13 of 28\nJanuary 26, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nBut maybe at a higher level, to try to get at your question: You know, asset purchases\nwere, were enormously important at the beginning of the recovery in terms of restoring market\nfunction, as they were at—right after the—in the critical phase of the Global Financial Crisis.\nAnd then after [that], they were a macroeconomic tool to support demand. And now the\neconomy no longer needs this, this highly accommodative policy that we put in place. So it’s\ntime to stop asset purchases first and then, at the appropriate time, start to shrink the balance\nsheet. Now, the balance sheet is, is substantially larger than it needs to be. We’ve identified the\nend state as—in amounts needed to implement monetary policy efficiently [and] effectively in\nthe ample-reserves regime. So there’s a substantial amount of, of shrinkage in the balance sheet\nto be done. That’s going to take some time. We want that process to be orderly and predictable.\nAnd so those are some of the ways that I would think this, this lays out our, you know, the way\nwe—the way we’re thinking about this.\nIn terms of the timing, I can’t really help you. You know, it just says after, after we get\nunder way. So we’re—I would say we are, we’re going to have another discussion at, at the next\nmeeting. And my guess is, we’ll have at least one other discussion at the meeting after that.\nAnd, you know, we’ll, we’ll tell you as we make progress. And we’ll, you know, we’ll start the\nprocess of allowing runoff and shrinking the balance sheet at what we find to be the appropriate\ntime. It’s—I wish I could say more. But, honestly, we haven’t made those decisions. And we\nactually haven’t even really had the, the important discussions on a lot of the details that we will\nhave at coming meetings.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let’s go to Craig Torres.\nCRAIG TORRES. Chair Powell, Chair Powell. Good afternoon, Michelle and Chair\nPowell. Craig Torres from Bloomberg. Chair Powell, at the beginning of the conversation, you\nPage 14 of 28\nJanuary 26, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nsaid risks are two sided. And I’m wondering if you can elaborate on what are the risks to the\nelusive soft landing. Is Fed policy a risk? Overtightening? Or what are the risks?\nAnd then second, Chair Powell, I have a quick administrative question. You know,\nRobert Kaplan’s disclosure of his securities transactions—and in a couple of months, Chair\nPowell, or maybe sooner, you and I will file our tax returns. And we’ll list transactions and all\nkinds of things. And next to those transactions, we’ll put dates. And Bloomberg asked for the\ndates of Mr. Kaplan’s transactions. The Dallas Fed is not giving us the dates. And I don’t see\nwhy this is a matter for the inspector general or anybody else. I mean, why can’t he give us the\ndates? Will you help us get the dates of those transactions? Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. So you asked about the risks first. So I—you know, the one risk is\nthat inflation risks are still to the upside in the views of most FOMC participants and, certainly,\nin my view as well. There’s a risk that, that the high inflation we’re seeing will be prolonged,\nand there’s a risk that it will move even higher. So we don’t—we don’t think that’s the base\ncase, but you asked what the risks are. And that’s—we have to be in a position with our\nmonetary policy to address all of the plausible outcomes. And that calls for us to be in position.\nWe, we have an expectation about the way the economy is going to be evolved, but we’ve got to\nbe in a position to, to address different outcomes, including the one where inflation remains\nhigher.\nAnd, of course, that is a risk to the—to the—to the expansion. You know, we’ve been\nsaying that what we need here is another long expansion, which is the kind of thing we saw over\nthe last [one], which was a record long expansion. We saw labor force participation rise. We\nsaw wages persistently higher for people at the lower end, and there, there really was no obvious\nPage 15 of 28\nJanuary 26, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nimbalance in the economy that threatened that expansion. It could have gone on for years were it\nnot hit by the pandemic.\nSo we’d love to find a way to get back to that. That’s going to require price stability, and\nthat’s going to require the Fed to tighten interest rate policy and do our part in getting inflation\nback down to our 2 percent goal.\nSo I mentioned two-sided risks. You know, a couple things. One, Omi—COVID is not\nover. And COVID can continue to evolve, and it’s just—we have to accept that it’s not over,\nand the risks to it can slow down growth. And that would be—that’s sort of a downside risk\nfrom a growth standpoint. I would point to—you know, another, another risk is just further,\nfurther problems in the supply chains, which could slow down activity. And you see the\nsituation in China as a situation there where that’s—their no-COVID policy may cause more\nlockdowns, is likely to, and that may play into—may play into more problems in supply chains.\nIn addition, there’s what’s going on in Eastern Europe and things like that. So there’s plenty of\nrisk out there. And we, you know, we can’t—we can’t forget that there are risks on both sides.\nSo that’s, that’s there. That’s what I would say.\nI know you’ve been all over this issue with, with my colleagues, Craig, on the issue of, of\ninformation. We don’t—we don’t have that information at the Board. And, you know, I hand—\nI asked the inspector general to do an investigation, and that is out of my hands. I play no role in\nit. I seek to play no role in it. And I don’t—I really—I can’t help you here today on this issue.\nAnd I’m sorry I can’t.\nCRAIG TORRES. Okay, okay.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We’ll go to Jeanna now.\nPage 16 of 28\nJanuary 26, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Thanks for taking our questions, Chair Powell. And sorry for my\ntech issues. I wonder if you could tell us a little bit about where your thinking on inflation stands\ntoday. You know, the last time we saw an SEP back in September, we saw that you and your\ncolleagues were projecting that inflation would sort of sink back down quite close to target by\nthe end of the year. And I wonder if you still think that projection from December is a\nreasonable one. And if your thinking has changed at all, I wonder how you’re thinking about\nthat. And I also wonder if you could talk a little bit about the pathway to getting to that\ndeceleration. Like, how do—how do we get from here, 7 percent CPI, to where you expect to be\nat the end of the year?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I’d say, you know, since, since the December meeting, I would\nsay that the inflation situation is about the same but probably slightly worse. I’d be inclined to\nraise my own estimate of 2022 core PCE inflation—let’s just go with that—by a few tenths\ntoday. But we’re not writing, writing down an SEP at this meeting. But I think it’s—it hasn’t\ngotten better. It’s probably gotten just a—just a bit worse, and that’s been the pattern. That’s\nbeen the pattern.\nSo I think if you look at the—the FOMC participants are—there’s a range there. And\nthat range has been moving to the right for, for a year now. And, by the way, if you look at other\nforecasters, essentially all other macro forecasters who do this for a living, you’ve seen the same\npattern. So, what do we think about that? Well, I think we, you know, we wrote down rate\nincreases in the December meetings, each of us individually. And I think to the extent the\nsituation deteriorates further, our policy will have to address that, if it deteriorates meaningfully\nfurther, either in the time dimension or in the size of the inflation dimension. So that’s how\nwe’re thinking about it.\nPage 17 of 28\nJanuary 26, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nI—as I mentioned, though, I think it’s—part of this will be that us, the Fed, moving away\nfrom a very highly accommodative policy to a substantially less accommodative policy and then,\nover time, to a policy that’s not accommodative, in time. I don’t know when that will be.\nThat’s—those are the things that we’re—that we’re thinking about. That’s, that’s part of it.\nAnother part of it is that fiscal policy provided an impulse to growth over the last two years.\nThat impulse will be less, in fact, will be—will be negative this year. And so that’s another\nthing. The other one is, we will eventually get relief on the supply side. And, you know, the\nports will be cleared up. And there will be semiconductors and things like that. Now, what\nwe’re learning is, it’s just taking much longer, so I think—longer than expected. And that, I\nthink, does raise, raise the risk that high inflation will be more persistent. I do think we’ll come\noff of the highs that we saw in the early part of this episode in the—in the spring last year. But,\nreally, what’s—the question is going to be, what is inflation running at? And so we’ll be\nwatching that.\nAnd I, you know, we—our objective is to get inflation back down to 2 percent. It’s also\nto provide enough support to keep the labor market healthy. The labor market is very, very\nstrong right now, and I think that that strength will continue. There’s a—there’s really a shortage\nof workers. We see it particularly among production and nonsupervisory workers and people in\nthe lowest quartile. You see very large wage increases. I mentioned some of the other\nindicators. So I think that’s, that’s what we’re looking at. And we’re also—you know, we\nrealize, I think, as everyone does, that this outlook is quite uncertain and that we’re going to have\nto adapt. And we’re going to communicate as clearly as we can. But we’re going to have to be\nadaptable and, you know, move, move as appropriate.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Great. Thank you.\nPage 18 of 28\nJanuary 26, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let’s go to Colby Smith.\nCOLBY SMITH. Thank you, Michelle. Chair Powell, when you talk about being\nhumble and nimble about the path forward for monetary policy, does that also include the\npossibility of raising interest rates by larger increments and, say, doing a 50 basis point hike at\nsome point if inflation does not moderate sufficiently? And should we interpret this approach as\na departure from the gradual pace that we saw during the last hiking cycle?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, as I mentioned, we have not made these decisions. We really\nhaven’t. And, and what I can tell you now, though, is that we fully appreciate that this is a\ndifferent situation. If you look back to where we were in 2015, ’16, ’17, ’18 when we were\nraising rates, inflation was very close to 2 percent, even below 2 percent. Unemployment was,\nwas not at our estimates of the natural rate. And growth was, you know, in the 2 to 3 percent\nrange.\nRight now, we have inflation running substantially above 2 percent and, and, you know,\nmore persistently than we would like. We have growth—even in forecasts, even in the\nsomewhat reduced forecast for 2022—we still see growth higher than, substantially higher than\nwhat we estimate to be the potential growth rate. And we see a labor market where, by so many\nmeasures, it is historically tight. I think the—you know, in a way, the least tight aspect of it is, is\nlooking at the unemployment rate, which is still below our median estimate of, of [the\nunemployment rate consistent with] maximum employment. If you look at things like quits and\njob openings, as I mentioned earlier, and wages, you’re seeing—and, and just the ratio of job\nopenings to unemployed—you’re seeing a very, very tight labor market.\nNow, we also know that labor force participation is significantly lower. It’s\n1½ percentage points lower than it was in February of 2020. Maybe a [full] percentage point of\nPage 19 of 28\nJanuary 26, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthat is, is retirements. Some part of those retirements are, are, you know, related to COVID\nrather than just regular retirements. So we think there’s, there’s a pool of people out there who\ncould come back into the labor force. But it’s not happening very quickly, and it may not—it\nmay continue to not happen very quickly as long as the pandemic is on[going]. So that’s, that’s,\nthat’s how we think about that. We haven’t made—to your specific question—we really have\nnot addressed those questions. And we’ll begin to address them as we—as we move into the\nMarch meeting and meetings after that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Rachel.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Thank you, Michelle. And thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our\nquestions. I’m wondering if you can talk to us about any metrics that the Fed uses to assess how\ninflation affects different groups of Americans, especially lower-, lower-income earners? And\nare you worried that the Fed underestimates, or can’t effectively measure, the impact of inflation\non some of the most vulnerable households? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So it’s, it’s more a matter of—I think the problem that we’re—that\nwe’re talking about here is really that people who are on fixed incomes who are living paycheck\nto paycheck, they’re spending most or all of their—of, of what they’re earning on food, gasoline,\nrent, heating their—heating, things like that, basic necessities. And so inflation right away, right\naway forces people like that to make very difficult decisions. So that’s really the point. I\ndon’t—I’m not aware of, you know, inflation literally falling more on, on different\nsocioeconomic groups. It’s—that’s not the point. The point is, some people are just really in\na—prone to suffer more.\nI mean, for people who are economically well off, inflation isn’t good. It’s bad. High\ninflation is, is bad, but they’re going to be able to continue to eat and keep their homes and drive\nPage 20 of 28\nJanuary 26, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ntheir cars and things like that. It’s more—so that, that’s really how I think of it. And, you know,\nwe, we have to control inflation for the benefit of all Americans. But part of—part of it is just\nthat it’s particularly hard on people with fixed incomes and low incomes who spent most of\ntheir—of their income on necessities, which are—which are experiencing high inflation now.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let’s go to Edward Lawrence.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thanks, Michelle, and thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking\nthe question here. So year over year, inflation’s at a 40-year high. The [increase in] input costs\nfor producer price index for all of 2021 was the highest on record. Some investors fear that the\nFed might be moving too late. Now, you said no decisions were made on the path of rate hikes,\nbut was a rate hike more than 25 basis points discussed today?\nAnd as a follow to that—because I have problems with the mute button—as a follow to\nthat, you testified that the supply chain issues could be worked out by the end of the year. You\ntalked about that today. The CEO of Ford, though, told Fox Business today that the chip\nshortage will last into 2023. So today you said inflation will start to ease this year. I want to\ndrill down and get a timeline that you see as to when we could see that relief. Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So I, I would not say that I would expect the supply chain issues to\nbe completely worked out by the end of this year. I do not expect them, and I have not expected\nthem. What I would say, and I have been saying, is that I expect progress to be made in the\nsecond half of this year, mainly—progress because we’re not making much progress. If you\nlook at a ton of metrics, you can find some that suggest that delivery times are shorter and\ninventories in some industries moving up. But, overall, we’re not—we’re not making progress.\nAnd, you know, things like the semiconductor issue are going to—they’re going to be quite a\nlong time. I would think they’ll go more than through 2023.\nPage 21 of 28\nJanuary 26, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nIn terms of—so in terms of being too late, I would just say this. We—our policy needs to\nbe positioned to address the full range of plausible outcomes, as I said, and particularly the\npossibility that inflation will continue to run higher, more persistently than we’d expected. And\nwe think we are positioned to make the changes in our policy to do that, and, and we’re\ncommitted to doing that. And that’s, that’s really where we are.\nIn terms of your, your question about the, the size of rate increases, we haven’t—we\nhaven’t faced those decisions. We haven’t made them. It isn’t possible to sit down here today\nand tell you with any confidence what the—what the precise path will be. But in—as we work\nour way through this, meeting by meeting, we are aware that this is a very different, different\nexpansion, as I’ve said a couple times, with higher inflation, higher growth, a much stronger\neconomy. And I think those differences are likely to be reflected in—in the policy that we\nimplement.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let’s go to Mike McKee.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’d like to sort of weave some of the\nstrands of your answers together and ask you, as you start to reverse policy, what your goal is.\nAre you going to be raising interest rates until you get inflation to 2 percent? Do you want to go\nbelow 2 percent so that, on average, you get a 2 percent inflation rate? And because you said we\nhave to protect the employment part of your mandate, is there some sort of circuit breaker that\nwould stop you from raising interest rates on the employment side?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, no. There’s no—there’s nothing in our framework about having\ninflation run below 2 percent so that we would do that, try to achieve that outcome. So the\nanswer to that is, is “no.” What we’re trying to do is get inflation, keep inflation expectations\nwell anchored at 2 percent. That’s, that’s always the, the ultimate goal. And we do that in the\nPage 22 of 28\nJanuary 26, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nservice of having inflation—we get to that goal by having inflation average 2 percent over time.\nAnd if inflation doesn’t average 2 percent over time, then it’s not clear why inflation\nexpectations would be anchored at 2 percent. So that, that’s the way we think about that. You\nknow, it—what was the last part of your—of your question?\nMICHAEL MCKEE. I was asking if you’re protecting the employment side of the\nmandate, whether there’s some sort of circuit breaker there.\nCHAIR POWELL. Nothing like that. I mean, I would say you have a tremendously\nstrong labor market. And you have growth this year at—forecast to be well above—well above\npotential. I mean, people who are forecasting growth think potential growth is around 2\n[percent]. Most forecasts [of actual growth] are significantly above that for 2022, and that’s\neven with, with policy becoming substantially less accommodative. So the labor market’s going\nto be strong for some time.\nWe’re—ideally, what we’re trying to achieve is inflation getting back down to 2 percent.\nAnd we’re trying to do that in a process that, that, that accomplishes—you know, that will also\nleave the labor market in a very strong position. And no one really knows what that will take.\nAgain, I would say that it isn’t just monetary policy that’s helping inflation get down. It’ll be\nsupply-side improvements, and it’ll be less, less fiscal, you know, less fiscal impulse in all\nlikelihood.\nSo—but monetary policy will do our job. It is our job to get inflation down to 2 percent.\nAnd a situation where, where the two goals are—the two goals can be in tension is a difficult\none. But I—but I don’t really think they are here, though, because I think a really significant\nthreat to further strengthening in the labor market in the form of higher participation over time is\nhigh inflation. And also, high inflation is taking away the benefits of some of these larger wage\nPage 23 of 28\nJanuary 26, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nincreases that we’re seeing now. So we do hope to achieve, and our plan is to achieve, both of\nthose goals.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. If I could—if I could follow up, does the danger of tightening too\nmuch as policy works its way into the economy with a lag mean that you should go back to being\nmore forecast dependent in making decisions, rather than the state dependency you’ve been\nusing as a framework for the last year and a half or so?\nCHAIR POWELL. State dependency was particularly around the thought that if we—if\nwe saw a very strong labor market, we would wait to see actual inflation—actual inflation before\nwe tightened. And so that was a very state-dependent thought because, for a long time, we’d\nbeen tightening on the expectation of high inflation, which never appeared. And that was the\ncase for, for a number of years. So in this particular situation, we will be clearly monitoring\nincoming data as well as the evolving outlook.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Michael Derby.\nMICHAEL DERBY. Thank you for taking my question. I want to ask you, with the\nbenefit of hindsight, and I realize, I mean, that is what it is. But do you feel that, you know,\nmonetary policy and fiscal policy maybe did too much to react to the crisis and that part of the\ninflation problem that we’re having right now is because the government response, you know,\ncollectively was more than what the economy ended up needing?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think it’s too soon to write that history, really. But what I would\nsay is this. The—if you remember what it felt like at the beginning of the pandemic, literally the\nglobal economy shutting down in large part, including our own economy, and people going to\ntheir homes for weeks on end in masks, and there are no vaccines, and it could be a really long\nPage 24 of 28\nJanuary 26, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ntime to get them, you know. And then, you know, you have—economic activity drops by a\nshocking amount in one—so there was a real risk of lasting damage.\nAnd I think Congress responded remarkably with the—with the CARES Act, incredibly\ntimely and very powerful. People will—there’ll always be flaws in these things. But in real\ntime, it was a remarkable achievement. And we responded. And what we were able to do was,\nyou know, stave off a collapse of the financial system at the beginning and make time for what\nreally needed to happen, which was the income replacement and then the recovery that Congress\nenabled with the CARES Act.\nSo now, that was a lot of—that was a lot. And what we did was a lot. And, you know,\nnow—so, what we have now is, we have the strongest recovery of any, any country. And we\nhave—we have a recovery that looks completely unlike other recoveries that we’ve had, because\nwe’ve, we’ve put so much support behind the recovery. And we’re managing the, the relatively\nhigh-class problems that come with that, which are high inflation and a labor shortage. So—and\nthese are serious problems, very serious problems that we, you know, we’re working as hard as\nwe can on.\nWas it too much? Again, I’m going to leave that to the historians. And—but look, in\n25 years, we’ll look back at this incident, which will be a, you know, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-year period.\nAnd we’ll say, you know, we’ll have a—we’ll have a much better basis to make a judgment\nabout the actions that people took. But it was all founded, though, in a—in a very strong\nreaction to a, you know, to a unique historical event. And I guess I’ll have to leave it at that. I\nlook for—I hope I’ll be around to see how that looks in 25 years.\nMICHAEL DERBY. Fair enough. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let’s go to Jean Yung.\nPage 25 of 28\nJanuary 26, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nJEAN YUNG. Thanks, Michelle. Chair Powell, some investors are expecting the yield\ncurve could flatten, or even invert, after rate hikes begin. Would that worry you, and how\nimportant is that risk in the Fed’s consideration for adjusting policy?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we, we do monitor the slope of the yield curve, but we don’t\ncontrol the slope of the yield curve. Many flat—many factors influence longer-term interest\nrates. But it is something that we watch, and, and you will know that from when we had this\nissue a few years ago. And we take it into account, along with many other financial conditions,\nas we try to assess the implications of all those conditions for the economic outlook. So that’s,\nthat’s one thing I would say.\nAnother is, currently, you’ve got a slope. If you think about 2s to 10s, 2-year Treasury to\n10-year Treasury, I think that’s around 75 basis points. That’s well within the range of a\nnormal—of a normal yield-curve slope. So it’s something we’re monitoring. We don’t think of\nit as—I don’t think of it as some kind of an iron law. But we do look at it and try to understand\nthe implications and what it’s telling us. And it’s—but it’s one of many things that we monitor.\nJEAN YUNG. Can I follow up real quick and ask, if it—if it did invert, would you tie it\nto U.S. fundamentals? Or would it be driven by a much broader set of factors?\nCHAIR POWELL. We’d—that’s, that’s a good question in, in real time. Obviously,\nU.S. long-term sovereign debt is an—is an important global asset. And it—and the fact that our\nrates are so much higher than, than other risk-free sovereign rates around the world may put\nsomething of a ceiling on our—on our rates. I don’t know. But it would really depend on the—\non the facts and circumstances at that time.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let’s go to Brian Cheung for the last question.\nPage 26 of 28\nJanuary 26, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nBRIAN CHEUNG. Hi, Chairman Powell. Brian Cheung, Yahoo Finance. Within the\ncontext of just the broad effort to normalize rates, would you describe what you want to do as a\ngradual hiking? And then, secondly, within the context of hiking cycles, it’s often the talking\npoint for financial stability and wanting to make sure that asset bubbles don’t emerge. Is that\nsomething that has also factored into the conversation as you start to think about hiking rates?\nThanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. I would describe what we’re doing along these lines. This is going to\nbe a year in which we move steadily away from the very highly accommodative monetary policy\nthat we put in place to deal with the—with the economic effects of the pandemic. And that’s\ngoing to involve a number of things. It’s going to involve and does involve finishing asset\npurchases. It’s going to involve lifting off. And it’s going to involve additional rate increases as\nappropriate. And we, we have—we’re going to write down in March our next assessment of\nwhat that might be. It’s going to continue to evolve as the data evolve. We need to be quite\nadaptable, I think, in our understanding of this.\nThe last thing we’re going to do is, we’re going to have a couple more meetings, I think,\nto talk about allowing the balance sheet to begin to run off and [to] do so in a predictable\nmanner. And that’s, that’s something that we will also be doing as appropriate. And I\nwouldn’t—I don’t think it’s possible to say exactly how this is going to go. And we’re, we’re\ngoing to need to be, as I’ve mentioned, nimble about this.\nAnd the economy is quite different this time. I’ve said this several times now. The\neconomy is quite different. It’s stronger. Inflation is higher. The labor market is much, much\nstronger than it was. And growth is above trend, even this year, let alone last year. So all of\nthose things are going to go into our thinking as we make—as we make monetary policy. And\nPage 27 of 28\nJanuary 26, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nyou asked about financial stability concerns. In connection with our policy–was that your\nquestion?\nBRIAN CHEUNG. Yes. Within the context of other hiking cycles, it seems like [a set\nof] worries about asset bubbles emerging as a result of easy rates has been part of that . I didn’t\nknow if that was part of the discussion today.\nCHAIR POWELL. I would just say this. We, we, of course, have a financial stability\nframework. And what it shows is a number of, of positive aspects of financial stability. But you\nmentioned, really, [the behavior of] asset prices is one of the four. So asset prices are somewhat\nelevated, and they reflect a high risk appetite and that sort of thing. I don’t really think asset\nprices themselves represent a significant threat to financial stability, and that’s because\nhouseholds are in good shape financially than they have been. Businesses are in good shape\nfinancially. Defaults on business loans are low and that kind of thing. The banks are highly\ncapitalized with high liquidity and quite resilient and strong. There are some concerns in the—in\nthe nonbank financial sector around—still around money market funds, although the SEC is\nmaking—has made some very positive proposals there. And we also saw some things in the\nTreasury market during the acute phase of the crisis, which, which we’re looking at ways to\naddress. But, overall, the financial stability vulnerabilities are manageable—are manageable, I\nwould say.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you very much.\nPage 28 of 28"

    "press_conf": "March 16, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nTranscript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference\nMarch 16, 2022\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. I want to begin by acknowledging the tremendous\nhardship the Ukrainian people are suffering as a result of Russia’s invasion. The human toll is\ntragic. The financial and economic implications for the global economy and the U.S. economy\nare highly uncertain.\nAt the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy\ngoals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and price stability. Today, in support\nof these goals, the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by ¼ percentage point. The economy is\nvery strong, and against the backdrop of an extremely tight labor market and high inflation, the\nCommittee anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be\nappropriate. In addition, we expect to begin reducing the size of our balance sheet at a coming\nmeeting.\nEconomic activity expanded at a robust 5½ percent pace last year, reflecting progress on\nvaccinations and the reopening of the economy, fiscal and monetary policy support, and the\nhealthy financial positions of households and businesses. The rapid spread of the Omicron\nvariant led to some slowing in economic activity early this year. But cases have declined sharply\nsince mid-January, and the slowdown seems to have been mild and brief. Although the invasion\nof Ukraine and related events represent a downside risk to the outlook for economic activity,\nFOMC participants continue to foresee solid growth. As shown in our Summary of Economic\nProjections, the median projection for real GDP growth stands at 2.8 percent this year,\n2.2 percent next year, and 2 percent in 2024.\nThe labor market has continued to strengthen and is extremely tight. Over the first two\nmonths of the year, employment rose by more than a million jobs. In February, the\nPage 1 of 26\nMarch 16, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nunemployment rate hit a post-pandemic low of 3.8 percent, a bit below the median of Committee\nparticipants’ estimates of its longer-run normal level. The improvements in labor market\nconditions have been widespread, including for workers at the lower end of the wage distribution\nas well as for African Americans and Hispanics. Labor demand is very strong, and while labor\nforce participation has increased somewhat, labor supply remains subdued. As a result,\nemployers are having difficulties filling job openings, and wages are rising at their fastest pace in\nmany years. FOMC participants expect the labor market to remain strong, with the median\nprojection for the unemployment rate declining to 3.5 percent by the end of this year and\nremaining near that level thereafter.\nInflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. Aggregate demand is\nstrong, and bottlenecks and supply constraints are limiting how quickly production can respond.\nThese supply disruptions have been larger, and longer lasting, than anticipated, exacerbated by\nwaves of the virus here and abroad, and price pressures have spread to a broader range of goods\nand services. Additionally, higher energy prices are driving up overall inflation. The surge in\nprices of crude oil and other commodities that resulted from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will\nput additional upward pressure on near-term inflation here at home.\nWe understand that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least\nable to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We know that\nthe best thing we can do to support a strong labor market is to promote a long expansion—and\nthat is only possible in an environment of price stability. As we emphasize in our policy\nstatement, with appropriate firming in the stance of monetary policy, we expect inflation to\nreturn to 2 percent while the labor market remains strong. That said, inflation is likely to take\nlonger to return to our price-stability goal than previously expected. The median inflation\nPage 2 of 26\nMarch 16, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nprojection of FOMC participants is 4.3 percent this year and falls to 2.7 percent next year and 2.3\npercent in 2024; this trajectory is notably higher than projected in December, and participants\ncontinue to see risks as weighted to the upside.\nThe Fed’s monetary policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote\nmaximum employment and stable prices for the American people. Our policy has been adapting\nto the evolving economic environment, and it will continue to do so. As I noted, the Committee\nraised the target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point and anticipates that\nongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate. The median projection for the\nappropriate level of the federal funds rate is 1.9 percent at the end of this year—a full percentage\npoint higher than projected in December. Over the following two years, the median projection is\n2.8 percent—somewhat higher than the median estimate of its longer-run value. Of course, these\nprojections do not represent a Committee decision or plan, and no one knows with any certainty\nwhere the economy will be a year or more from now.\nReducing the size of our balance sheet will also play an important role in firming the\nstance of monetary policy. At our meeting that wrapped up today, the Committee made good\nprogress on a plan for reducing our securities holdings, and we expect to announce the beginning\nof balance sheet reduction at a coming meeting. In making decisions about interest rates and the\nbalance sheet, we will be mindful of the broader context in markets and in the economy, and we\nwill use our tools to support financial and macroeconomic stability.\nAs we noted in our policy statement, the implications of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine for\nthe U.S. economy are highly uncertain. In addition to the direct effects from higher global oil\nand commodity prices, the invasion and related events may restrain economic activity abroad and\nfurther disrupt supply chains—which would create spillovers to the U.S. economy through trade\nPage 3 of 26\nMarch 16, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nand other channels. The volatility in financial markets, particularly if sustained, could also act to\ntighten credit conditions and affect the real economy.\nMaking appropriate monetary policy in this environment requires a recognition that the\neconomy often evolves in unexpected ways. We will need to be nimble in responding to\nincoming data and the evolving outlook. And we will strive to avoid adding uncertainty to what\nis already an extraordinarily challenging and uncertain moment. We are attentive to the risks of\npotential further upward pressure on inflation and inflation expectations. The Committee is\ndetermined to take the measures necessary to restore price stability. The American economy is\nvery strong and well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy.\nTo conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses\nacross the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do\neverything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals. Thank you. I\nlook forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let’s go to Jeanna at the New York Times.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you so much for taking our questions. I\nwonder if you could detail your thinking a little bit about how you’re considering the, you know,\nthe risks of going too fast and potentially tipping the economy into recession and how you’re\nweighing those risks against the possibility of going too slowly, allowing inflation to become\nembedded, and kind of getting “behind the curve.”\nCHAIR POWELL. So I guess I would start by saying that, in my view, the probability of\na recession within the next year is not particularly elevated. And why do I say that? Aggregate\ndemand is currently strong, and most forecasters expect it to remain so. If you look at the labor\nmarket, [you find that it is] also very strong. Conditions are tight, and payroll job growth is\nPage 4 of 26\nMarch 16, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ncontinuing at very high levels. Household and business balance sheets are strong. And so all\nsigns are that this is a strong economy and, indeed, one that will be able to flourish—not to say\nwithstand, but certainly flourish—as well in the face of less accommodative monetary policy. So\nI guess that’s how I would say I’m looking at that. Of course, the objective is to achieve price\nstability while also sustaining a strong labor market. And that is our overall objective. But we\ndo feel the economy is very strong and well positioned to withstand tighter monetary policy.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let’s go to Howard at Reuters.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Hi, Chair Powell. I was wondering, in the SEPs, you have\nquite a markdown to GDP from 4 to 2.8 percent. I’m wondering, how much of that do you feel\nis the result of the Fed’s stiffer-than-expected action here? You talk about monetary policy\noperating with a lag, but is this going to bite quicker than expected?\nCHAIR POWELL. I don’t think that’s a big piece of it, actually. I think some of that is\njust an early assessment of the effects of spillovers from the war in Eastern Europe, which will\nhit our economy through a number of channels. Highly uncertain, but, you know, you’re looking\nat higher oil prices, higher commodity prices. It’ll be—we think that will weigh on GDP to\nsome extent. So that’s part of what moved those assessments down. I don’t think—I mean, I\nthink, generally, monetary policy works with a lag, so some of that would also be in there.\nBut remember, as well, that 2.8 percent is still very strong growth. If we think that the\npotential growth rate of the economy is somewhere between, somewhere around 1.75 percent,\n2.8 percent is strong economic growth. It would have been one of the strongest years, in fact, of\nthe last expansion. So, while it’s lower than last year’s 5.8 percent, it’s still quite strong growth.\nSo I would say it’s quite a strong forecast.\nPage 5 of 26\nMarch 16, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. So, in that context, what would trigger you to go faster or\nslower on the rate hikes? “Ongoing increases” doesn’t really tell us whether this is going to\ncome in bigger chunks or evenly paced through the year.\nCHAIR POWELL. So, you know, the way we’re thinking about this is that every\nmeeting is a live meeting. And we’re going to be looking at evolving conditions. And if we do\nconclude that it would be appropriate to move more quickly to remove accommodation, then\nwe’ll do so. I can’t be perfectly specific about it, but that’s certainly a possibility as we go\nthrough the year.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let’s go to Rachel at the Washington Post.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Thank you, Michelle. And thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our\nquestions. I’m curious if you can be specific on when you expect to see inflation will start to\ncome down, especially with the combination of rates going up, fiscal aid dissipating from the\neconomy, and supply chains getting better? And if you don’t start to see that, how will you\nsignal it? What will you be looking for? And what will you be looking for over the course of\nthe year? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So I guess I would say that at the—before the invasion of Ukraine by\nRussia—so let’s go back to that. I would have said that the expectation was that inflation would\npeak sometime in the first quarter, maybe the end of the first quarter of this year, and then maybe\nstay at that level or a little bit lower and then start to come down in the back half of the year. So\nnow we’re, you know, we’re getting—we’re going—we’re already seeing a little bit of short-\nterm upward pressure in inflation due to higher oil prices, natural gas [prices] a little bit but not\nso much for us since we have our own natural gas supply, other commodities prices.\nPage 6 of 26\nMarch 16, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nThe other thing is that you’re seeing supply chain issues around shipping and around, you\nknow, lots of countries and companies and people not wanting to touch Russian goods. So that’s\ngoing to mean more tangled supply chains. So that could actually push out [in time] the relief\nwe were expecting on supply chains generally. So I guess I would say that the expectation is still\nthat inflation will begin to come down in the second half of the year. But if you look at where I\nread the SEP headline median, we still expect inflation to be high this year, lower than last year,\nand then we expect—though, particularly with the effects of the war, but also the data we’ve\nseen so far this year—we expect inflation to remain high through the middle of the year, begin to\ncome down, and then come down more sharply next year.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Nick at the Wall Street Journal.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, over the\nlast six months, the Fed has shifted its policy stance quite a bit. Six months ago, you were still\nbuying assets. Most officials weren’t projecting any interest rate increases this year. And yet,\ndespite the shift over the last six months, real rates are as negative today as they were then. So\nhow concerned are you that further inflation surprises will offset the effects of recent policy\nfirming by leading real rates to stay at levels that do not actually provide much restraint to the\neconomy? Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. So that’s one of many ways of capturing the situation, which is that\nwe—the Committee really does understand that the time for rate increases and for shrinking the\nbalance sheet has come. And I would just say, I would go back to “the economy is very strong,”\nas I mentioned. Tremendous momentum in the labor market. We expect growth to continue. As\nI—it’s clearly time to raise interest rates and begin the balance sheet shrinkage.\nPage 7 of 26\nMarch 16, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nAnd I just wanted to say that as I looked around the table at today’s meeting, I saw a\nCommittee that’s acutely aware of the need to return the economy to price stability and [is]\ndetermined to use our tools to do exactly that. You couched it in terms of real rates. I would\nsay, if you look at the SEP, you’ve got people getting close to or even above, in many cases,\ntheir estimate of the longer-run neutral rate. So I understand that doesn’t do it for real rates. But\nif you go out a year or two, many people are, in their forecasts, are having tight policy from a\nreal interest rate standpoint.\nSo that’s something that we’re focused on. Of course, it’s a highly uncertain\nenvironment. And, you know, we don’t know what’s going to happen. But we do know that\nwe’re going to deploy our tools to achieve our goals—and that includes the price-stability goal.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Victoria at Politico.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Chair Powell. So, looking at the Summary of Economic\nProjections, you all have inflation coming down over the course of the year to 4.3 percent. And\nthen you also have rates going up to what appears to still be below roughly what would be\nestimated to be the neutral rate, although I know that’s a little bit uncertain. So I was just\nwondering, how much of inflation coming down do you see as actually being as a result of the\nFed itself raising rates? And then also, if I could just ask, given that Sarah Bloom Raskin\nwithdrew her nomination, what do you expect to do with the regulatory portfolio? Do you\nexpect to assign a Governor in charge of that?\nCHAIR POWELL. Okay, sorry. Tell me again your first question.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. My first question is, how much do you expect inflation to come\ndown as a direct result of the Fed’s actions?\nPage 8 of 26\nMarch 16, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. Okay. So part of inflation coming down at the very beginning is\nclearly to do with factors other than our policy, and those would include, potentially, the supply\nchain is getting a little bit better, certainly base effects. You’re lapping—as you know, when you\nlook at a 12-month trailing window, you’re lapping very high inflation in March, April, May,\nJune of last year. So there should be some effects from that in the 12-month picture. Really\nwhat we’re looking for, though, is month-by-month inflation coming down. And so it’s really,\nit’s all the things we’ve been talking about, you know, that really haven’t helped much, including\nthe shift away from goods and back to services, including supply chains getting better, including\nlabor force participation—all those things that have been sticky and not happening. But a big\npart of it is, though, is the base effects I mentioned as well.\nYou know, I think monetary policy starts to bite on inflation, and on growth, with a lag,\nof course. And so you would see that more in ’23 and ’24. But also, remember we started\ntalking about rate increases last year. For some months now, financial conditions have already\nincorporated a significant number of rate increases. So it doesn’t start today. The effect, the\nmoves are already priced into the market for a few months now. So the clock is running on that,\nand I think some of that will be seen in the second half of the year as well.\nSo on the regulatory portfolio, I would just say this. You know, we have an obligation to\ncarry out under the law in supervision and regulation, and we’re doing that. That’s what we’re\ndoing. The committee is not active. So what’s happening is, things are coming to the full Board,\nand we’re voting on them. We’re getting our business done. You know, we got the stress tests\ndone. We’ve looked at, you know, a number of proposals for mergers and things like that. So\nwe’re working ahead. Of course, we don’t have a Vice Chair for Supervision, as you mentioned.\nPage 9 of 26\nMarch 16, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nBut we’re making do with the situation we have. And a good number of things have come\nstraight to the Board for approval.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Neil Irwin at Axios. [Pause] Let’s go to Neil Irwin.\nNEIL IRWIN. Hi, Chair Powell. It’s Neil Irwin at Axios. Thanks for taking our\nquestions. In the statement of economic projections, we see a forecast of median 1.9 percent fed\nfunds rate at the end of the year, 2.8 end of next year. Wondered whether that aligns with your\nown expectations, in particular on that point of overshooting the long-term neutral rate. And,\nalso, if you can tell us anything about how that might be paced: front-loaded, back-loaded. How\nhigh is the bar for doing 50 at one meeting?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I don’t—Neil, I’ve never talked about my own SEP projection.\nIt’s in there, but I, you know, I think Fed Chairs have generally not done that, because we just\nhaven’t done it. It’s because we’re, you know, we have to put together the consensus on the\nCommittee and present that consensus. So I wouldn’t talk about my individual one.\nAnd in terms of the pacing of it, I would just point out that that is—there’s seven\nremaining meetings this year. This isn’t something we discuss or debate or agree on. But there’s\nseven remaining meetings, and there’s seven rate hikes. I would add there’s also the shrinkage\nof the balance sheet, which, you people do the math different ways, but that might be the\nequivalent of another rate increase just from the runoff of the balance sheet. So I don’t—but I\ndon’t know. We haven’t made any decisions on front-end loading or going steadily through the\nyear.\nAnd, as I mentioned, you know, if you look at the SEP, a good number of participants do\nsee more than seven or eight increases this year. And I can’t give you, I’m not going to try to\ngive you a really specific test for what it would take to do that. But I will say this, that we’ll be\nPage 10 of 26\nMarch 16, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nlooking at the data as they come in. We’ll be looking to see whether the data show expected\nimprovement on inflation. We’ll be looking at the inflation outlook and making a judgement.\nAnd we’ll be going—each meeting is a live meeting. And if we conclude that it would be\nappropriate to raise interest rates more quickly, then we’ll do so.\nMICHELLE SMITH. [Long pause] One second. Okay. We’re going to try one more\ntime. Colby Smith at the FT. [Long pause] Okay. We’ll come back to Colby. Let’s go to\nEdward Lawrence.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Yes. Thank you, Chair Powell. Thank you, Michelle, for the\nquestion. I have a more basic question. The last time the CPI inflation—I know you look at\nPCE, but CPI inflation—was as high as it is was July of 1981, when the effective federal funds\nrate was 19.2 percent. But given the current data, how far behind the curve of inflation do you\nbelieve the Federal Reserve is, in your mind?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I just would say a couple things. We have the tools that we need,\nand we’re going to use them. And, as you can see, we have a plan over the course of this year to\nraise interest rates steadily and also to run off the balance sheet. We will take the necessary steps\nto ensure that high inflation does not become entrenched, while also supporting a strong labor\nmarket. And, as I mentioned, if we conclude that it would be appropriate to move more quickly,\nwe’ll do so. I’ll leave it to others to make the judgment you asked for.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. And then just as a follow on that, I wanted to get you on the\nrecord on this. What impact has there been on your job, given the fact that [indaudible]—\nCHAIR POWELL. We lost you in the middle of the question.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Edward, can you repeat that question?\nPage 11 of 26\nMarch 16, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. —the impact that—given you’re not actually confirmed and\nGovernor Brainard is not actually confirmed, has there been any impact on your job or the Fed’s\nability to handle inflation?\nCHAIR POWELL. None whatsoever.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Okay, let’s go to Colby Smith at the FT.\nCOLBY SMITH. Thank you, Michelle. Chair Powell, how concerned is the Committee\nabout the notable pickup in services inflation, which is perhaps less likely to self-correct? And\nto what extent does it alter both the Committee’s confidence that long-term inflation expectations\nwill not de-anchor in the coming months as well as the balance of risks that the Fed may need to\nraise interest rates further above neutral than indicated in the dot plot? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Thank you. So, of course, that’s something we’re watching report by\nreport. And we’re certainly, we noticed it in the last meeting. And it’s part of the overall\npicture. We have expected services inflation to move back up to where it was, and that’s part of\nwhat’s happening is, in the case of some services, prices are still getting back up to where they\nwere before the crisis. In other cases, it’s pretty clear that inflation has spread more broadly\nacross services. And, yes, that is concerning. In the meanwhile, we see some progress on the\ngood side. But, really, in this latest report, it was confined to vehicles, which is, admittedly, a\nlarge category. So, you know, as I mentioned, the Committee acutely feels its obligation to\nmove to make sure that we restore price stability and is determined to use its tools to do so.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let’s go to Steve Liesman at CNBC.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I wonder if you can help me understand\nthe kind of logic, if there is one, in the SEP here. As I look at the median forecast, for example,\nfor unemployment, it runs for the three-year window below the long-run rate. I look at inflation\nPage 12 of 26\nMarch 16, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nbeing above, over the three-year window, the long-run—or call it the neutral—rate, so the\neconomy still runs hot. And that is all true in a regime when you run at least for two years the\nfunds rate above the long-run rate.\nI guess my question is this: Are you not create—giving a forecast here that essentially\nsuggests you will be continuing to run further “behind the curve”—and never really get in front\nof inflation, because the economy will continue to run hot? And, kind of on a related issue: You\nsaid earlier [that] inflation will take longer to return to price stability than we had originally\nexpected. Isn’t that a choice you’re making? And, if so, why are you making that choice to let\ninflation run above price stability longer than you’d like?\nCHAIR POWELL. Right. So our, if you look, our—first of all, there is no—you’re\nlooking at medians. But understand that there’s no, it’s not something we voted on. It’s not a\nplan. But if you look, people do have their in—by the end of this year, broadly, people are at or\nclose to or, in some cases, above their estimates of longer-run neutral interest rate. Okay. So\nthat should stop pushing—that should, in other words, that should be a removal of\naccommodation for monetary policy, basically. At the same time, we will have done significant\nbalance sheet runoff. And you can think of that as further.\nIn the next year, and just looking at the median, you’re now above the, you know, above\nthe, what people estimate to be the longer-run median. And also, in many people’s forecasts,\nthat actually amounts to, you know, tight policy under, in real rates as well. So why does\nunemployment remain at 3.5 percent? You know, it—I mean, a couple points. One is the\nconnection between—in the economy we had before the pandemic, the connection between\ninflation and the level of the unemployment rate was not very tight.\nPage 13 of 26\nMarch 16, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nBut this is—clearly, what this is is an expectation that, really it amounts to that, the idea\nthat wage increases, which are now running above the level that would be consistent over the\nlong run with 2 percent inflation, will move back down to levels which are still very attractive,\nfull-economy kind of—full-employment kind of wages, but not to a point where they’re pushing\nup inflation anymore. And, as I mentioned, there are a lot of factors causing inflation to come\ndown. And, you know, the reality is, there are many, many moving pieces, and we don’t know\nwhat will actually happen. But no matter what happens, this is a Committee that is determined to\nuse its tools to make sure that higher inflation does not become entrenched. And so we are\ndetermined on that front, and we’ll deal with what comes. This is a modal, or most likely,\nexpectation. But we’ll deal with what comes, whether it’s better or worse.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let’s go to Chris Rugaber at the AP.\nCHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Hi. Thank you. Well, let me follow up a bit on that. I\nmean, there are a lot of economists skeptical that you can reduce inflation as much as you’ve\npenciled in without raising the unemployment rate. And I’m wondering, just what are the\nmechanisms you see in reducing demand? I mean, outside housing and autos, how do higher fed\n[funds] rates reduce consumer demand unless it’s through higher unemployment? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, if you take a look at today’s labor market, what you have is\n1.7-plus job openings for every unemployed person. So that’s a very, very tight labor market—\ntight to an unhealthy level, I would say. So, in principle, if you were—let’s say that our tools\nwork about as you described, and the idea is, we’re trying to better align demand and supply,\nlet’s just say in the labor market. So it would actually, if you were just moving down the number\nof job openings so that they were more like one to one, you would have less upward pressure on\nPage 14 of 26\nMarch 16, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nwages. You would have a lot less of a labor shortage, which is going on pretty much across the\neconomy.\nWe’re hearing from companies that they can’t hire enough people. They’re having a hard\ntime hiring. So that’s really the thinking there, is, you know, these are fairly well-understood\nchannels, interest sensitive. And, basically, across the economy, we’d like to slow demand so\nthat it’s better aligned with supply; give supply, at the same time, time to recover; and get into a\nbetter, you know, a better alignment of supply and demand. And that, over time, should bring\ninflation down.\nAnd I’ll say again, though, you know, we don’t have a perfect crystal ball about the\nfuture, and we’re prepared to use our tools as needed to restore price stability. You know, as I\nmentioned in my opening remarks, without price stability, there—you really can’t have a\nsustained period of maximum employment. It’s our—one of our most fundamental obligations is\nto maintain and restore, in this case, price stability. So we’re very committed to that. Of course,\nthe plan is to restore price stability while also sustaining a strong labor market. That is our\nintention, and we believe we can do that. But we have to restore price stability.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Okay. Let’s go to Scott Horsley at NPR.\nSCOTT HORSLEY. Thanks. And I apologize if this covers some of the same ground\nyou just talked about, Mr. Chair. I think I missed some of your answer there. But I have a\nfollow-up question on the labor force. We have seen some gains in the prime-age workforce in\nthe last few months. I wonder what you anticipate when it comes to some of the older workers\nas the health outlook has changed. Are we going to see more recent retirees following Tom\nBrady back into the workforce? And what would that mean for wages and inflation?\nPage 15 of 26\nMarch 16, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. It’s hard to say. You know, what we saw in the last cycle was that,\nover the course of a long, steady expansion, labor force participation outperformed expectations.\nAnd that was just a, you know, it was a tight labor market, but it wasn’t—it was nowhere near as\ntight as this labor market. But it was a tight labor market, and so people stayed in the labor force\nlonger. It wasn’t so much people coming back in the labor force after retirement. That’s not\nsomething that happens, in the aggregate, very much. But, so that’s what was happening.\nAnd, you know, more labor force participation is tremendously welcome. And, of\ncourse, our policy does not in any way preclude that. This is a situation where wages have\nmoved up at the highest rate in a very long time. And people are able to quit their jobs and move\nto better-paying jobs in the same industry or different industries. So it’s a really attractive labor\nmarket for people. And once, you know, as we get past COVID well and truly, it becomes an\neven more attractive one. So we hope that that will lead to more labor supply. That’s a good\nthing for the country. It’s a good thing for people.\nAnd it also will, we think, help relieve some of the wage pressures that do put inflation\nmore at risk. That last part is, we’ll have to see whether, empirically, it winds up, works out that\nway. But, in principle, it ought to help with inflation as well. It’s not the only thing we’re\nlooking for, though, from inflation. We’re looking for help from a number of different places\nand, most importantly, from our own policy.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Okay. Let’s go to Rich Miller at Bloomberg.\nRICH MILLER. Thank you, Michelle. And thank you, Chair Powell. I’m sorry; I’m\nhaving some communication problems. So I missed some of the stuff you’ve said, and my\napologies if this has been asked. Since the FOMC met last January, financial conditions have\ntightened markedly, equity prices down, Treasury yield’s up, bond spread’s risen, yield curve has\nPage 16 of 26\nMarch 16, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nflattened a lot, and even further just today, dollar’s up. Is that welcome? And would you like to\nsee more in order to achieve your goals? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So, as you know, policy works through financial conditions. That’s\nhow it reaches the real economy—by just the mechanisms you mentioned. And remember that\nthe financial conditions we had for the last couple of years were a function not only of very\naggressive, and appropriately so, fiscal policy, but also highly accommodative monetary\npolicy—the monetary policy settings that we put in place at the worst parts of the pandemic. So\nit is very appropriate to move away from those.\nAnd, yes, that will lead to some tightening in financial conditions in the form of higher\ninterest rates and just the sorts of things—we’re not targeting any one or more of those things,\nbut financial conditions generally should move to a more normal level so that—because we\nknow the economy no longer needs, or wants, these very highly accommodative, this stance,\nwhich, you know, so it’s time to move to a more normal setting of financial conditions, and we\ndo that by moving monetary policy itself to more normal levels.\nRICH MILLER. When you say “move to a more normal setting” for financial\nconditions, that suggests to me that you want financial conditions to tighten further from where\nwe are now. Am I drawing the right inference from that?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, yes. So I would say, we look at a broad range of financial\nconditions. And, of course, when we tighten monetary policy, we do expect that they will adjust\nin sync over time with monetary policy. It’s not any particular financial condition, but a broad\nrange of financial conditions. They will reflect to some extent—they reflect any number of\nthings. But, yes, we need our policy to transmit to the real economy. And it does so through\nfinancial conditions, which means that, as we tighten policy or remove accommodation so that\nPage 17 of 26\nMarch 16, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nit’s at least less accommodative, that broader financial conditions will also be less\naccommodative.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Just a little housekeeping note: Those of you in this\ncall may be having some tech issues. If so, I understand the broadcast is coming through clearly\non www.federalreserve.gov. You might go there for the audio. And now we’ll go to Jean Yung.\nJEAN YUNG. Hi, Chair Powell. I wanted to ask about the balance sheet discussion you\nhad at this meeting. Can you give us any more details? Did you discuss whether to cap runoffs\nor whether to increase those caps over what period, if there were any details?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes. Thank you for asking. So, at our meeting today and yesterday,\nwe made excellent progress toward agreeing on the parameters of a plan to shrink the balance\nsheet. And I’d say we’re now in a position to finalize and implement that plan so that we’ll\nactually begin a runoff at a coming meeting. And that could come as soon as our next meeting in\nMay. That’s not a decision that we’ve made. But I would say that that’s how well our\ndiscussions went in the last two days.\nSo a couple things just to add. We’ll be mindful of the broader financial and economic\ncontext when we make the decision on timing, and we always want to use our tools to support\nmacroeconomic and financial stability. We want to avoid adding uncertainty to what’s a highly\nuncertain situation already. So all of that will go into the thinking of the timing around this.\nIn terms of the—I would say this. I don’t want to get too much into the details, because\nwe’re literally just finalizing them. But the framework is going to look very familiar to people\nwho are familiar with the last time we did this. But it’ll be faster than the last time. And, of\ncourse, it’s much sooner in a cycle than last time. But it will look familiar to you. And I would\nalso say that there’ll be—I’m sure there’ll be a more detailed discussion of our—in the minutes\nPage 18 of 26\nMarch 16, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nto our meeting that come out in three weeks, where I expect that it will lay out, you know, pretty\nmuch the parameters of what we’re looking at, which I think will look quite familiar.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let’s go to Michael McKee at Bloomberg TV.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Mr. Chairman, since September of 2020, you’ve been operating on\na monetary policy framework that let the economy run hot to bring unemployment down. That\nseems to be over. But I’m wondering how you would describe your reaction function now.\nWhat is it that the Fed is trying to do other than bring inflation down? In other words, is it, we’re\ngoing to keep raising rates until it comes down to an acceptable level?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes. So I want to clear one thing up again. And that is that nothing\nin our new framework or in the changes that we made has caused us to wait longer to raise\ninterest rates. What we said in the framework changes was—and this was really a reflection of\nwhat had happened for the preceding couple of decades, actually. What we said was, if we see,\nyou know, low unemployment, high employment, but we don’t see inflation, then we’re not\ngoing to raise rates ’til we actually see inflation. That’s what we said, and that was the sense of\nit. There was no sense in which, if we got a burst of really high inflation, we would wait to raise\nrates. That’s simply not in the framework. In fact, quite the contrary. The framework is all\nabout anchoring inflation expectations at 2 percent.\nSo I do hear this, you know, that the framework—really, we can’t blame the framework.\nIt was a sudden, unexpected burst of inflation. And then it was the reaction to it, and it was what\nit was. But it was not in any way caused by or related to the framework. So, come to today.\nYou know, I think our vision on this on the Committee is very, very clear. What we see is a\nstrong labor market. We see a labor market with a lot of momentum, great job creation. And we\nsee the underlying economy’s strong. Balance sheets are strong. Yes, there are threats to growth\nPage 19 of 26\nMarch 16, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nfrom, you know, from what’s going on in Eastern Europe. And, but, nonetheless, in the base\ncase, there’s a pretty broad expectation of strong growth.\nBut inflation is far above our target. And, you know, the help we’ve been expecting and\nother forecasters have been expecting from supply-side improvement, labor force participation,\nbottlenecks, all those things getting better—it hasn’t come. And so we’re looking now to using\nour tools to restore price stability, and we’re committed to doing that. And you see that, I think,\nin the Summary of Economic Projections. And you see that in the decision we make, and you’ll\ncontinue to see it in the decisions we make, going forward.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. If I could follow up by asking—I guess what you’d call it is the\n“Paul Volcker” question: You don’t think unemployment is going to rise significantly, but, if it\ndoes, does that temper your desire to keep raising rates?\nCHAIR POWELL. The goal, of course, is to restore price stability while also sustaining\na strong labor market. We have a dual mandate, and they’re sort of equal. But, as I said earlier,\nyou know, price stability is an essential goal. In fact, it’s a precondition, really, for achieving the\nkind of labor market that we want, which is a strong and sustained labor market. We saw the\nbenefits of a long expansion, a sustained labor market. It pulled people back in, and there were\nreally no imbalances in the economy that threatened the long expansion. It, just, the pandemic\narrived; it was just a completely exogenous event. So that’s how we’re thinking about it.\nWe, of course, want to achieve, you know, price stability with a strong labor market. But\nwe do understand also that, really, you can’t have maximum employment for any sustained\nperiod without price stability. So we need to focus on price stability particularly, because the\nlabor market is so strong and the economy is so strong. We feel like the economy can handle\ntighter monetary policy.\nPage 20 of 26\nMarch 16, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let’s go to Brian Cheung at Yahoo.\nBRIAN CHEUNG. Hi, Chair Powell. Hopefully no tech issues here on this front.\nWanted to ask just kind of the broad question about how you are communicating what the Fed’s\ndoing here today to the average American who might not be reading the dot plots or\nunderstanding what the SEP is. How is the 25 basis point hike today and then the signaling on\nfuture Fed policy going to address the inflation that they’re feeling at the stores on a daily basis?\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So I guess I’d start by just assuring everyone that we’re fully\ncommitted to bringing inflation back down and also sustaining the economic expansion. We do\nunderstand that these higher prices, no matter what the source, have real effects on people’s well-\nbeing. And, really, high inflation takes a toll on everyone. But it’s really, especially, on people\nwho use most of their income to buy essentials like food, housing, and transportation, where—I\nmean, we’ve all seen charts that show, if you’re a middle-income person, you’ve got room to\nabsorb some inflation. If you’re at the lower end of the income spectrum, it’s very hard because\nyou’re spending most of your money already on necessities, and the price is going up.\nBut it’s punishing for everyone. So it has been a difficult time for the economy. But we\ndo anticipate that inflation will move back down, as I mentioned earlier. It may take longer than\nwe like, but I’m confident that we’ll use our tools to bring inflation down. You asked about\nrates. So the way that works, I would explain, is, as we raise interest rates, that should gradually\nslow down demand for the interest-sensitive parts of the economy. And so what we would see is\ndemand slowing down, but just enough so that it’s better matched with supply. And that\nbrings—that will bring inflation down over time. That’s our plan.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let’s go to Jo Ling Kent at NBC News.\nPage 21 of 26\nMarch 16, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nJO LING KENT. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you so much for taking my question during\nthis today. My question is a follow-up to what Brian just asked. What is your message to\nconsumers out there who can no longer afford the basics due to this high inflation?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, that is—yes, indeed. I mean, as I just said, you know, I think\nwe do understand very much, and we very much take to heart, that it’s our obligation to restore\nprice stability. And, you know, we’ve had price stability for a very long time and maybe come\nto take it for granted. But now we see the pain. I’m old enough to remember what very high\ninflation was like. And, you know, we’re strongly committed as a Committee to not allowing\nthis higher inflation to become entrenched and to use our tools to bring inflation back down to\nmore normal levels, which—our target is 2 percent inflation. So we will do that.\nAnd I just would want people to understand that, and that’s—but the way we do that is by\nraising interest rates and by shrinking our balance sheet. And so financial conditions will\nbecome, at the margin, less supportive of various kinds of economic activity. That will slow the\neconomy, while also allowing the labor market to remain very strong. And, you know, the good\nnews is, the economy and the labor market are quite strong. And that means the economy, we\nthink, can handle interest rate increases.\nJO LING KENT. And as a quick follow-up to that, you know, obviously, the Federal\nReserve walking this very complicated fine line, trying to avoid a recession. For the consumers\nout there who are worried about their jobs in a possible recession, what do you say to that?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, I, you know, I say that our intention is to bring inflation back\ndown to 2 percent, while still sustaining a strong labor market and that the economy is very\nstrong. If you look at where forecasts are, people are forecasting growth that’s strong within the\ncontext of U.S. potential economic output. So—and we expect that to continue. And to the\nPage 22 of 26\nMarch 16, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nextent the data come in different, then, of course, our policy will adapt. But we do believe that\nour policy is the appropriate one for this forecast, and we believe that we can bring down\ninflation. We believe that we can do so while sustaining a strong labor market.\nThe labor market is—it’s not strong in the ordinary sense of the word. We have not seen\na labor market where there are 1.7 job openings for every unemployed person or where there, if\nyou add job openings to those who are employed, that’s actually substantially a larger number\nthan the size of the workforce, than the number of people who actually count themselves as in\nthe workforce. So this is a situation where demand is higher than supply. And when that\nhappens, prices go up. And they—so we need to use our tools to move supply and demand back.\nAnd we don’t think we need to do this alone. There will be other factors helping that happen.\nBut we certainly are prepared to use our tools—and we will.\nJO LING KENT. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let’s go to Simon at the Economist.\nSIMON RABINOVITCH. Hi. Thank you, Michelle. Thank you, Chair Powell. Sorry\nto take you away from inflation for one minute. May I ask about the sanctions on Russia and,\nspecifically, the freezing of the central bank assets? Of course, that raises a similar risk for other\nsovereigns around the world and their biggest companies, potentially. Any concerns about, in\nthe long term, how this might affect the dollar’s status as the preeminent global reserve\ncurrency? And in the past couple of weeks, have you had to deliver any kinds of reassurance to\nother central bankers around the world?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, so, of course, central bankers around the world are generally\nvery in favor of these sanctions. But let me say this: Sanctions are really the business of the\nelected government, and that’s true everywhere. So the Administration and the Treasury\nPage 23 of 26\nMarch 16, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nDepartment, in particular, and other agencies—they create these sanctions. We’re there to\nprovide technical expertise, but they’re not, it’s not our decisions. And so I’m reluctant to\ncomment on sanctions really much because, again, they’re not for us [to decide]. We have a very\nspecific mandate. And these are really the province of elected governments, as I mentioned. So\nI’d have to leave it at that. Sorry.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let’s go to Nancy Marshall-Genzer at Marketplace.\nNANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Hi, Chair Powell. Thanks for taking the question.\nYou’ve been talking a lot about rising wages, which, on the one hand, is a great thing, but are we\npossibly seeing the beginning of a wage–price spiral?\nCHAIR POWELL. So the way I would say it is this: We, first of all, I would agree with\nthe premise that wages moving up is a great thing. You know, that’s how the standard of living\nrises over time. And, generally, it’s driven over long periods by rising productivity. But what\nwe have now, if you look at these, the wage increases that we have, we look at a—we’re blessed\nwith a range of measures of wages that all measure different things. But right now, they’re all\nshowing the same thing, which is that the increases—not the levels, but the increases—are\nrunning at levels that are well above what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation, our goal,\nover time. And that may be—we don’t know how persistent that phenomenon will be. It’s very\nhard to say.\nAnd that’s really, I think, the sense of your question about a wage–price spiral; is that\nsomething that’s going to start happening and become entrenched in the system? We don’t see\nthat. You can see, for example, in some sectors that got very high wage increases early on, those\nwage increases looked like they may have slowed down to a normal level. But it comes back to,\nyou know, what I’m saying here—which is, there’s a misalignment of demand and supply,\nPage 24 of 26\nMarch 16, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nparticularly in the labor market. And that is leading to wages moving up at ways that are not\nconsistent with 2 percent inflation over time. And so we need to use our tools to, you know,\nguide inflation back down to 2 percent. And that would be in the context of an extraordinarily\nstrong labor market. We think this labor market can handle, as I mentioned, tighter monetary\npolicy. And the overall economy can as well.\nBut, yes, wages are moving up faster than is consistent with 2 percent inflation, but it’s\ngood to see that moving up. But it wouldn’t be sustainable over too long of a period to see them\nmoving up that much higher. And that’s because of this misalignment between supply and\ndemand. We expect to get more labor supply. We did last time. We got more than we expected\nduring the last cycle. This time, we’ve gotten much less than expected. So it’s not easy to\npredict these things. But we do expect that we’ll get people coming back in the labor market,\nparticularly as COVID becomes less and less of a factor in many people’s lives, something we\nall wish. But, so that’s how we think about it.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. For the last question, we’ll go to Don Lee at the L.A.\nTimes.\nDON LEE. Hi, Chair Powell. I think you said to the Senate earlier this month that, in\nhindsight, the Fed should have moved earlier. And it sounds like today that you don’t think that\nthe Fed is late. And, just wanted to get your clarification on that. And if it is, if you still think\nthat the Fed is “behind the curve,” how much “behind the curve” is it?\nCHAIR POWELL. Right. So we are not—we don’t have the luxury of 20/20 hindsight\nin actually implementing real-time decisions in the world. So, you know, so the question is—the\nright question is, did you make the right decisions based on what you knew at the time? But\nthat’s not the question I was answering, which is knowing what you know now. So I think if we\nPage 25 of 26\nMarch 16, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nknew now—of course, if we knew now that these supply blockages, really, and the inflation\nresulting from them in collision with, you know, very strong demand, if we knew that that was\nwhat was going to happen, then in hindsight, yes. It would have been appropriate to move\nearlier. Obviously, it would be. But, again, we don’t have that luxury.\nAnd then, so, but that’s a separate question from your other question, which is “behind\nthe curve.” And, you know, I don’t have the luxury of looking at it that way. You know, we are,\nwe have our tools—powerful tools—and the Committee is very focused on using them. We’re\nacutely aware of the need to restore price stability while keeping a strong labor market. And\nwhat I saw today was a Committee that is strongly committed to achieving price stability, in\nparticular, and prepared to use our tools to do that. We’re not going to let high inflation become\nentrenched. The costs of that would be too high. And we’re not going to wait so long that we\nhave to do that. No one wants to have to really put restrictive monetary policy on, in order to get\ninflation back down.\nSo, frankly, the need is one of getting back up, getting rates back up to more neutral\nlevels as quickly as we practicably can and then moving beyond that, if that turns out to be\nappropriate. And, as you can see, it is appropriate in the sense that, [in] people’s [contributions\nto the] SEPs, they do write down levels of interest rates that are above their estimate of the\nlonger-run neutral rate. And there’s also a range of estimates, too, as you will see if you look at\nthe details of the SEP. But thanks for your question.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Okay. Thank you all. Thanks, Mr. Chair.\nCHAIR POWELL. Thank you.\nPage 26 of 26"

    "press_conf": "May 4, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nTranscript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference\nMay 4, 2022\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. It’s nice to see everyone in person for the first time\nin a couple years.\nBefore I go into the details of today’s meeting, I’d like to take this opportunity to speak\ndirectly to the American people.\nInflation is much too high, and we understand the hardship it is causing, and we’re\nmoving expeditiously to bring it back down. We have both the tools we need and the resolve\nthat it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses. The\neconomy and the country have been through a lot over the past two years and have proved\nresilient. It is essential that we bring inflation down if we are to have a sustained period of\nstrong labor market conditions that benefit all.\nFrom the standpoint of our Congressional mandate to promote maximum employment\nand price stability, the current picture is plain to see: The labor market is extremely tight, and\ninflation is much too high. Against this backdrop, today the FOMC raised its policy interest rate\nby ½ percentage point and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target rate for the federal\nfunds rate will be appropriate. In addition, we are beginning the process of significantly\nreducing the size of our balance sheet. I’ll have more to say about today’s monetary policy\nactions after briefly reviewing economic developments.\nAfter expanding at a robust 5½ percent pace last year, overall economic activity edged\ndown in the first quarter. Underlying momentum remains strong, however, as the decline largely\nreflected swings in inventories and net exports—two volatile categories whose movements last\nquarter likely carry little signal for future growth. Indeed, household spending and business\nfixed investment continued to expand briskly.\nPage 1 of 24\nMay 4, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nThe labor market has continued to strengthen and is extremely tight. Over the first three\nmonths of the year, employment rose by nearly 1.7 million jobs. In March, the unemployment\nrate hit a post-pandemic, and near-five-decade, low of 3.6 percent. Improvements in labor\nmarket conditions have been widespread, including for workers at the lower end of the wage\ndistribution as well as for African Americans and Hispanics. Labor demand is very strong, and,\nwhile labor force participation has increased somewhat, labor supply remains subdued.\nEmployers are having difficulties filling job openings, and wages are rising at the fastest pace in\nmany years.\nInflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. Over the 12 months\nending in March, total PCE prices rose 6.6 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy\ncategories, core PCE prices rose 5.2 percent. Aggregate demand is strong, and bottlenecks and\nsupply constraints are limiting how quickly production can respond. Disruptions to supply have\nbeen larger, and longer lasting, than anticipated, and price pressures have spread to a broader\nrange of goods and services. The surge in prices of crude oil and other commodities that resulted\nfrom Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is creating additional upward pressure on inflation. And\nCOVID-related lockdowns in China are likely to further exacerbate supply chain disruptions\nas well.\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine is causing tremendous loss and hardship, and our thoughts\nand sympathies are with the people of Ukraine. Our job is to consider the implications for the\nU.S. economy, which remain highly uncertain. In addition to the effects on inflation, the\ninvasion and related events are likely to restrain economic activity abroad and further disrupt\nsupply chains, creating spillovers to the U.S. economy through trade and other channels.\nPage 2 of 24\nMay 4, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nThe Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware\nthat high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher\ncosts of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We are highly attentive to the risks that\nhigh inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to restoring\nprice stability.\nAgainst the backdrop of the rapidly evolving economic environment, our policy has been\nadapting, and it will continue to do so. At today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target\nrange for the federal funds rate by ½ percentage point and stated that it “anticipates that ongoing\nincreases in the target range will be appropriate.” We also decided to begin the process of\nreducing the size of our balance sheet, which will play an important role in firming the stance of\nmonetary policy. We are on a path to move our policy rate expeditiously to more normal levels.\nAssuming that economic and financial conditions evolve in line with expectations, there is a\nbroad sense on the Committee that additional 50-basis-point increases should be on the table at\nthe next couple of meetings. We will make our decisions meeting by meeting as we learn from\nincoming data and the evolving outlook for the economy. And we will continue to communicate\nour thinking as clearly as possible. Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation\nback down to our 2 percent goal.\nWith regard to our balance sheet, we also issued our specific plans for reducing our\nsecurities holdings. Consistent with the principles we issued in January, we intend to\nsignificantly reduce the size of our balance sheet over time in a predictable manner by allowing\nthe principal payments from our securities holdings to roll off the balance sheet, up to monthly\ncap amounts. For Treasury securities, the cap will be $30 billion per month for three months and\nPage 3 of 24\nMay 4, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nwill then increase to $60 billion per month. The decline in holdings of Treasury securities under\nthis monthly cap will include Treasury coupon securities and, to the extent that coupon securities\nare less than the monthly cap, Treasury bills. For agency mortgage-backed securities, the cap\nwill be $17.5 billion per month for three months and will then increase to $35 billion per month.\nAt the current level of mortgage rates, the actual pace of agency MBS runoff would likely be less\nthan this monthly cap amount. Our balance sheet decisions are guided by our maximum-\nemployment and price-stability goals. And, in that regard, we will be prepared to adjust any of\nthe details of our approach in light of economic and financial developments.\nMaking appropriate monetary policy in this uncertain environment requires a recognition\nthat the economy often evolves in unexpected ways. Inflation has obviously surprised to the\nupside over the past year, and further surprises could be in store. We therefore will need to be\nnimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook. And we will strive to avoid\nadding uncertainty to what is already an extraordinarily challenging and uncertain time. We are\nhighly attentive to inflation risks. The Committee is determined to take the measures necessary\nto restore price stability. The American economy is very strong and well positioned to handle\ntighter monetary policy.\nTo conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and\nbusinesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the\nFed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.\nThank you, and I look forward to your questions.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, the\nunemployment rate at 3.6 percent in March is now essentially at the level that the Committee had\nexpected would prevail over the next three years and at the bottom end of FOMC participants’\nPage 4 of 24\nMay 4, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nprojections for the longer-run rate that you submitted in the projections at the last meeting. How\nhas your outlook for further declines in the unemployment rate changed since March? What\ndoes this imply for your inflation forecast? And how has your level of confidence changed with\nregard to the feasibility of slowing hiring without pushing the economy into recession? Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. Thank you. So you’re right—3.6 percent unemployment is just\nabout as low as it’s been in 50 years. And I would say that I expect, and Committee members\ngenerally expect, that we’ll get some additional participation. So people will be coming back\ninto the labor force. We’ve seen that particularly among prime-age people. And that will, of\ncourse, tend to hold the unemployment rate up a little bit. I would also expect, though, that job\ncreation will slow. Job creation has been, you know, more than half a million per month in\nrecent months—very, very strong, particularly for this stage of the economy. And so we think—\nwith fiscal policy less supportive, with monetary policy less supportive, we think that job\ncreation will slow as well. So it is certainly possible that the unemployment would go down\nfurther. But so I would expect those to be relatively limited because of the additional supply and\nalso just the slowing in job creation.\nImplications for inflation—really, the wages matter a fair amount for companies,\nparticularly in the service sector. Wages are running high, the highest they’ve run in quite some\ntime. And they are one good example, or good illustration, really, of how tight the labor market\nreally is, the fact that wages are running at the highest level in many decades. And that’s\nbecause of an imbalance between supply and demand in the labor market. So we think through\nour policies—through further healing in the labor market, higher rates, for example, of vacancy\nfilling and things like that, and more people coming back in—we’d like to think that supply and\ndemand will come back into balance and that, therefore, wage inflation will moderate to still\nPage 5 of 24\nMay 4, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nhigh levels of wage increases, but ones that are more consistent with 2 percent inflation. That’s\nour expectation. Your third question was?\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Your level of confidence that you can slow hiring without pushing\nthe economy into a downturn.\nCHAIR POWELL. So I guess I would say it this way: There’s a path. There’s a path by\nwhich we would be able to have demand moderate in the labor market and therefore have\nvacancies come down without unemployment going up, because vacancies are at such an\nextraordinarily high level. There’re 1.9 vacancies for every unemployed person, 11.5 million\nvacancies, 6 million unemployed people. So we haven’t been in that place on the vacancy, sort\nof the vacancy/unemployed curve, the Beveridge curve. We haven’t been at that sort of level of\na ratio in the modern era. So, in principle, it seems as though by moderating demand, we could\nsee vacancies come down and, as a result—and they could come down fairly significantly and, I\nthink, put supply and demand at least closer together than they are. And that would give us a\nchance to get inflation down, get wages down, and then get inflation down without having to\nslow the economy and have a recession and have unemployment rise materially. So there’s a\npath to that.\nNow, I would say, I think we have a good chance to have a soft or softish landing or\noutcome, if you will. And I’ll give you a couple of reasons for that. One is, households and\nbusinesses are in very strong financial shape. You’re looking at, you know, excess savings on\nbalance sheets—excess in the sense that they’re substantially larger than the prior trend.\nBusinesses are in good financial shape. The labor market is, as I mentioned, very, very strong.\nAnd so it doesn’t seem to be anywhere close to a downturn. Therefore, the economy is strong\nand is well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy. So, but I’ll say, I do expect that this\nPage 6 of 24\nMay 4, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nwill be very challenging; it’s not going to be easy. And it may well depend, of course, on events\nthat are not under our control. But our job is to use our tools to try to achieve that outcome, and\nthat’s what we’re going to do.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Thanks for taking my question,\nMr. Chairman. You talked about using 50-basis-point rate hikes or the possibility of them in\ncoming meetings. Might there be something larger than 50? Is 75 or a percentage point\npossible? And perhaps you could walk us through your calibration. Why one month should—or\none meeting should we expect a 50? Why something bigger? Why something smaller? What is\nthe reasoning for the level of the amount of tightening? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So a 75-basis-point increase is not something the Committee is\nactively considering. What we are doing is, we raised [the funds rate by] 50 basis points today.\nAnd we’ve said that, again, assuming that economic and financial conditions evolve in ways that\nare consistent with our expectations, there’s a broad sense on the Committee that additional 50-\nbasis-point increases should be on the table for the next couple of meetings. So we’re going to\nmake those decisions at the meetings, of course, and we’ll be paying close attention to the\nincoming data and the evolving outlook as well as to financial conditions. And, finally, of\ncourse, we will be communicating to the public about what our expectations will be as they\nevolve.\nSo the test is really just as I laid it out—economic and financial conditions evolving\nbroadly in line with expectations. And, you know, I think expectations are that we’ll start to see\ninflation, you know, flattening out—and not necessarily declining yet, but we’ll see more\nevidence. We’ve seen some evidence that core PCE inflation is perhaps either reaching a peak\nPage 7 of 24\nMay 4, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nor flattening out. We’ll want to know more than just some evidence. We’ll want to really feel\nlike we’re making some progress there. And we’re going to make these decisions, and there’ll\nbe a lot more information. I just think we want to see that information as we get there. It’s a\nvery difficult environment to try to give forward guidance 60, 90 days in advance. There are just\nso many things that can happen in the economy and around the world. So, you know, we’re\nleaving ourselves room to look at the data and make a decision as we get there.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. I’m sorry, but if inflation is lower one month and the unemployment\nrate higher, would that be something that we would calibrate toward a lower increase in the\nfunds rate?\nCHAIR POWELL. I don’t think the one month is—no. No. One month’s reading\ndoesn’t tell us much. You know, we‘d want to see evidence that inflation is moving in a\ndirection that gives us more comfort. As I said, we’ve got two months now where core inflation\nis a little lower, but we’re not looking at that as a reason to take some comfort. You know, I\nthink we need to really see that our expectation is being fulfilled—that inflation, in fact, is under\ncontrol and starting to come down. But, again, it’s not like we would stop. We would just go\nback to 25-basis-point increases. It’ll be a judgment call when these meetings arrive. But, again,\nour expectation is, if we see what we expect to see, then we would have 50-basis-point increases\non the table at the next two meetings.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Okay. Let’s go to Colby.\nCOLBY SMITH. Thank you. Colby Smith from the Financial Times. Given the\nexpectation that inflation will remain well above the Fed’s target at year-end, what constitutes a\nneutral policy setting in terms of the fed funds rate? And to what extent is it appropriate for\npolicy to move beyond that level at some point this year?\nPage 8 of 24\nMay 4, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. So—neutral. When we talk about the neutral rate, we’re really\ntalking about the rate that neither pushes economic activity higher nor slows it down. So it’s a\nconcept, really. It’s not something we can identify with any precision. So we estimate it within\nbroad bands of uncertainty. And the current estimates on the Committee are sort of 2 to 3\npercent. And also, that’s a longer-run estimate. That’s an estimate for an economy that’s at full\nemployment and 2 percent inflation. So, really, what we’re doing is, we’re raising rates\nexpeditiously to what we see as the broad range of plausible levels of neutral. But we know that\nthere’s not a bright line drawn on the road that tells us when we get there. So we’re going to be\nlooking at financial conditions, right? Our policy affects financial conditions, and financial\nconditions affect the economy. So we’re going to be looking at the effect of our policy moves on\nfinancial conditions. Are they tightening appropriately? And then we’re going to be looking at\nthe effects on the economy. And we’re going to be making a judgment about whether we’ve\ndone enough to get us on a path to restore price stability. It’s that. So if that path happens to\ninvolve levels that are higher than estimates of neutral, then we will not hesitate to go to those\nlevels. We won’t.\nBut, again, there’s a sort of false precision in the discussion that we as policymakers\ndon’t really feel. You know, you’re going to raise rates, and you’re going to be kind of inquiring\nhow that is affecting the economy through financial conditions. And, of course, if higher rates\nare required, then we won’t hesitate to deliver them.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Neil.\nNEIL IRWIN. Thanks, Chair Powell. Neil Irwin with Axios. Do you see evidence that\ninflationary psychology is changing in areas like workers’ wage demands, businesses’\nPage 9 of 24\nMay 4, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nwillingness to raise prices? Do you see evidence that there is a psychological shift going on on\ninflation? Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. We don’t really see strong evidence of that yet, but that does not in\nany way make us comfortable. I think if you look at short-term inflation expectations, they’re\nquite elevated. And you can look at that and say, “Well, that’s because people expect inflation to\ncome down.” And, in fact, inflation expectations [at longer horizons] come down fairly sharply.\nLonger-term inflation expectations have been reasonably stable but have moved up to—but only\nto levels where they were in 2014, by some measures. So you can look at that. And I think\nthat’s a fair description of the picture. But it’s really about the risks. We don’t see a wage–price\nspiral. We see that companies have the ability to raise prices, and they’re doing that, but there\nhave been price shocks. So I just think it takes you back to the basic point—was that we know\nwe need to expeditiously move our policy rate up to ranges of more normal, neutral levels. And\nwe need to look around and keep going if we don’t see that financial conditions have tightened\nadequately or that the economy is behaving in ways that suggest that we’re not where we need to\nbe. So, again, you don’t see those things yet, but I would say there’s no basis for feeling\ncomfortable about that. It’s a risk that we simply can’t run. We can’t allow a wage–price spiral\nto happen. And we can’t allow inflation expectations to become unanchored. It’s just something\nthat we can’t allow to happen, and so we’ll look at it that way.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jeanna.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Great. Thanks, Chair Powell. Jeanna Smialek with the New York\nTimes. You mentioned in the statement both the upside risks to inflation from Russia and China.\nObviously, those are very much supply shocks rather than demand side. And I wonder what you\nmeant to convey by adding them—I wonder what you meant to convey by adding those.\nPage 10 of 24\nMay 4, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. Well. So our tools don’t really work on supply shocks. Our tools\nwork on demand. And to the extent we can’t affect, really, oil prices or other commodity prices\nor food prices and things like that, so we can’t affect those. But there’s a job to do on demand.\nAnd that—you can see that in the labor market, where demand is substantially in excess of\nsupply of workers. And you can see it in the product markets as well. But I guess I’m just\npointing out that—a couple of things. For both the situation in Ukraine and the situation in\nChina, they’re likely to, both, add to headline inflation. And people are going to be suffering\nfrom that, you know. People almost suffer more from food and energy shocks then, but—even\nthough they don’t actually tell us much about the future path. So the second thing is that they’re\nboth capable of preventing further progress in supply chains healing or even making supply\nchains temporarily worse. So they’re going to weigh on the process of global supply chain\nhealing, which is going to affect broader inflation, too. So, in a way, they’re two further negative\nshocks that have hit really in the last, you know, 60 days, 90 days.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi. Victoria Guida from Politico. I want to follow up on that,\nbecause you all have obviously highlighted that there are both supply and demand issues at play\nin inflation. And I’m just wondering, you know, if these supply chain issues continue because of\nRussia, because of China, or just because these things take a while to work out, does getting back\ndown to your 2 percent mandate require that the supply chain issues get resolved, since you can\nonly handle the demand side, as you said? Or will you have to crimp demand maybe even\nfurther if the supply chain issues don’t resolve themselves, in order to try and get inflation back\ndown to where you want it to be?\nPage 11 of 24\nMay 4, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. So, you know, I’ll just say: For now, we’re focused on doing the job\nwe need to do on demand, and there’s plenty to be done there. Again, if you look at it, it’s\nessentially almost two to one, job vacancies to unemployed people. There’s a lot of excess\ndemand. There’re more than 5 million more employed plus job openings than there are the size\nof the labor force. So there’s an imbalance there that we have to do our work on. A very\ndifficult situation—you know, you would look at core inflation, which wouldn’t include the\ncommodity price shocks. And, you know, that’s one of the reasons we would tend to focus on\nthat, because we can have more of an effect on that, but it would be a very difficult situation. I\nmean, we have to be sure that inflation expectations remain anchored. And I mean, that’s part of\nour job, too, so we’d be watching that carefully. And it puts any central bank in a very difficult\nsituation.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Howard.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Howard Schneider with Reuters. And thanks, and nice to be\nback. So two questions. One quick one. You’ve cited the 1.9 to 1 figure so often now, I’ve got\nto ask you, what would be a good figure there? What would you like to see that come down to to\nthink that you’re in sort of a noninflationary vacancy-to-unemployed rate? And, secondly, on\nhelp from inflation, how much are you counting on wealth effects through stock market\nchannels? Equity markets broadly down quite a bit since late fall, first of the year—how are you\nmapping that into household consumption? Have they come down enough? Do you need\nanother leg down in equity values to think that households are going to stop spending at the rate\nwe need them to stop spending?\nCHAIR POWELL. Okay, so in terms of the vacancies-to-unemployment ratio, we don’t\nhave a goal in mind. There’s no specific number that we’re saying, “We’ve got to get to that.”\nPage 12 of 24\nMay 4, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nIt’s really, you’ve got to get to a place where the labor market appears to be more in balance.\nAnd that depends not only on the level of those things—it also, it depends on how well the\nmatching functions in the labor markets are working. Because, you know, the longer these\nexpansions go on, you can get very efficient with all of that, and the Beveridge curve shifts out.\nAnd that also tends to, you know, to help. So there isn’t a specific number. I will say we were—\nyou know, I think, I think when we got to one-to-one in the, you know, in the late teens, we\nthought that was a pretty good number. But, again, we’re not shooting for any particular\nnumber. What we’d like to see is progress, but we’re not really looking at that. That’s an\nintermediate variable. We’re looking at wages, and we’re looking at, ultimately, inflation. So,\nyou know, there are a bunch of channels through which policy works. You can think of it as,\nyou know, interest-sensitive spending, and then you can think of another big one as asset values\nbroadly. And, you know, there’re big models with, you know, a lot of different channels that are\nrelated to that. You know, we don’t focus on any one market—the equity market or the housing\nmarket—we focus on financial conditions broadly. So we wouldn’t be targeting any one market,\nas you suggest, for going up or down or taking a view on whether it’s at a good level or a bad\nlevel. We just would be looking at very broad measures of financial conditions—all the different\nfinancial conditions indexes, for example, which include equity. But they also include debt and\nother, many other things—credit spreads, things like that—too.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Rachel.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Hi, Chair Powell. Rachel Siegel here from the Washington Post.\nTo follow up from your message from the very beginning, what is your message to the American\npeople about when they will start to feel the effects of, say, a 50-basis-point rate hike or multiple\nPage 13 of 24\nMay 4, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nhikes? How do you explain to them what that does to their grocery bill or their rent or their gas\nbill? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So, first, the first thing to say is that we understand. And some of us\nare old enough to have lived through high inflation, and many aren’t. But it’s very unpleasant.\nIt’s just something people don’t—when they experience it for the first time, you’re paying more\nfor the same thing. If you’re a normal economic person, then you probably don’t have that much\nextra to spend. And it’s immediately hitting your spending on groceries, on, you know, on\ngasoline, on energy, and things like that. So we understand the pain involved. So how do you\nget out of that? And it’s our job to make sure that inflation of that unpleasant, high nature\ndoesn’t get entrenched in the economy. That’s what we’re here for, one of the main things we’re\nhere for—perhaps the most fundamental thing we’re here for. And the way we do that is, we try\nto get supply and demand back in sync with each other, back in balance, so that the economy is\nunder less stress and inflation will go down. Now, the process of getting there involves higher\nrates—so higher mortgage rates, higher borrowing rates, and things like that. So it’s not going to\nbe pleasant either. But in the end, everyone is better off. Everyone— particularly people on\nfixed incomes and at the lower part of the income distribution are better off with stable prices.\nAnd so we need to do everything we can to restore stable prices. We’ll do it as quickly and\neffectively as we can. We think we have a good chance to do it without a significant increase in\nunemployment or, you know, a really sharp slowdown. But, ultimately, we think about the\nmedium and longer term, and everyone will be better off if we can get this job done—the sooner,\nthe better.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Edward.\nPage 14 of 24\nMay 4, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you, Chair Powell. Edward Lawrence with the Fox\nBusiness Network. So you’ve talked in the past about consumer spending and how that drives\nthe economy. Are you concerned, with this high level of inflation, that the consumer will stop\nspending—and what’s the level of your concern—pushing us into a recession?\nCHAIR POWELL. So the economy is doing fairly well. We expect growth to be solid\nthis year. And we see, you know, household spending and business investment as fairly strong—\nand even in the first quarter, which was relatively slow on some other fronts. So, and the labor\nmarket—if you look at the labor market, for people who are out of work and looking, there are\nlots of job opportunities for—wages are moving up and at rates that haven’t been seen in quite a\nlong time. So it’s a good time to be a worker looking to, you know, either change jobs or get a\nwage increase in your current job. So it’s a strong economy, and nothing about it suggests that\nit’s close to, or vulnerable to, a recession. Now, of course, given events around the world and\nfading fiscal policy effects and higher rates, you could see some slower economic activity.\nCertainly, it will not be—last year was an extraordinarily strong growth year as we recovered\nfrom the pandemic. As I mentioned, growth [was] over 5 percent. But most forecasters have\ngrowth this year at, you know, at a solid pace above 2 percent.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. But we’ve talked with economists who have advised\nDemocrats and Republican Presidents who both said that the Fed is so far behind the curve on\ninflation that a recession is inevitable.\nCHAIR POWELL. So, and as I said, I think we have a good chance to restore price\nstability without a recession—without, you know, a severe downturn; without materially high,\nhigher unemployment. And I mentioned the reasons for that. So I see a strong economy now. I\nsee a very strong labor market, for example. Businesses can’t find the people to hire—they can’t\nPage 15 of 24\nMay 4, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nfind them. So, typically, in a recession, you would have unemployment. Now you have surplus\ndemand. So there should be room, in principle, to reduce that surplus demand without putting\npeople out of work. The issue will come that we don’t have precision surgical tools. We have,\nessentially, interest rates, the balance sheet, and forward guidance, and they’re famously blunt\ntools. They’re not capable of surgical precision. So I would agree. No one thinks this will be\neasy, no one thinks it’s straightforward, but there is certainly a plausible path to this, and I do\nthink we’ve got a good chance to do that. And, you know, our job is not to rate the chances—it\nis to try to achieve it. So that’s what we’re doing. There are a range of opinions, though, and\nthat’s only appropriate.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve Dorsey.\nSTEVE DORSEY. Thanks. Steve Dorsey, CBS. You mentioned earlier, just now,\nfading fiscal policy. Do you feel that the Fed has been supported enough from policies at the\nWhite House and in Congress in combating inflation?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, it’s really the Fed that has responsibility for price\nstability. And we take whatever arrives at the Fed in terms of fiscal activity, we take it as a\ngiven, and we don’t evaluate it—it’s not our job, really. We don’t have an oversight function\nthere. And we look at it as our job, given all the factors that are happening, to try to sustain\nmaximum employment and price stability. So if Congress or the Administration has ways to\nhelp with inflation, I would encourage that, but I’m not going to get into making\nrecommendations or anything like that. It’s not, it’s really not our role—we need to stay in our\nlane and do our job. When we get inflation back under control, then maybe I can, you know,\ngive other people advice [laughter]. Right now, we need to focus on, just focus on doing our job.\nAnd I’ll stick to that. Stick in our lane.\nPage 16 of 24\nMay 4, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve Matthews.\nSTEVE MATTHEWS. Steve Matthews with Bloomberg News. A number of your\ncolleagues have said that the rates will need to go above neutral into a restrictive territory to\nbring down inflation. One, do you agree with that? And, two, you’ve recently spoken in great\npraise of Paul Volcker, who had the courage to bring inflation down with recessions in the\n1980s. And while it’s certainly not your desire—the soft landing is the big hope of everyone—\nwould this FOMC have the courage to endure recessions to bring inflation down if that were the\nonly way necessary?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think it’s certainly possible that we’ll need to move policy to\nlevels that we see as restrictive as opposed to just neutral. We can’t know that today. That\ndecision is not in front of us today. If we do conclude that we need to do that, then we won’t\nhesitate to do it. I’ll say again, there’s no bright line, you know, that you’re stepping over.\nYou’re really looking at what our policy stance is and what the market is forecasting for it.\nYou’re looking at financial conditions and how that’s affecting the economy and making a\njudgment. You know, we won’t be arguing about whose model of the neutral rate is better than\nthe other one. It’s much more about a practical application of our policy tools. And we’re\nabsolutely prepared to do that. It—wouldn’t hesitate if that’s what it takes.\nSo I am, of course—who isn’t an admirer of Paul Volcker? I shouldn’t be singled out in\nthis respect. But I knew him just a little bit and have tremendous admiration for him. And I—\nBut I would phrase it this way: He had the courage to do what he thought was the right thing.\nThat’s what it was. It wasn’t a particular thing. It was that he always did—he always did—what\nhe thought was the right thing. If you read his last autobiography, that really comes through. So\nthat’s [what] the test is. It isn’t, will we do one particular thing?\nPage 17 of 24\nMay 4, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nI would say, we do see, though—we see restoring price stability as absolutely essential\nfor the country in coming years. Without price stability, the economy doesn’t work for anybody,\nreally. And so it’s really essential, particularly for the labor market. If you think about it, like if\nyou look at the last cycle, we had a very, very—longest expansion cycle in our recorded history.\nIn the last two, three years, you had the benefits of this tight labor market going to people in the\nlower quartiles. And it was, you know, racial, wealth, and income—not wealth, but income gaps\nwere coming down, wage gaps. So it’s a really great thing. We’d all love to get back to that\nplace. But to get back to anything like that place, you need price stability. So, basically, we’ve\nbeen hit by historically large inflationary shocks since the pandemic. This isn’t anything like\nregular business. This is, we have a pandemic, we have the highest unemployment, you know,\nin—since the Depression. Then we have this outsized response from fiscal policy and monetary\npolicy. Then we have inflation. Then we have a war in Ukraine, which is cutting the\ncommodity, you know, patch in half. And now we have these shutdowns in China. So it’s been\na series of inflationary shocks that are really different from anything people have seen in 40\nyears. So we have to look through that and look at the economy that’s coming out the other side.\nAnd we need to somehow find price stability out of this. And it’s obviously going to be very\nchallenging, I think, because you do have, you know, numerous supply shocks, which are\nfamously difficult to deal with. So I guess that’s how I think about it.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Chris Rugaber.\nCHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Thank you. Chris Rugaber, Associated Press. Earlier,\nyou just said that if necessary—I think were the words—that you would, or if it, if it turned out\nto be necessary, or you said that it’s possible that we’ll need to move policy to restrictive levels.\nGiven where inflation is and the hot economy is—or, certainly, the hot labor market, as you\nPage 18 of 24\nMay 4, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ndescribed it—why still the hesitation? I mean, what else do you need to see in order to\ndetermine that? Wouldn’t the Fed naturally be looking to go to a restrictive level at this point?\nThank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So I didn’t—if I said “necessary,” I meant to say “appropriate.”\nWe’re not going to be erecting a high barrier for this. It’s more, if we think it’s appropriate.\nYou know, the point is, we’re a very long way from neutral now. We’re moving there\nexpeditiously, and we’ll continue to do so. And we can’t make that decision, really, today. The\ndecision for about how high to go will be on the table to be made when we reach neutral. And,\nyou know, I expect we’ll get there expeditiously, as I’ve mentioned. So it’s not that we don’t\nwant to—making that decision today wouldn’t really mean anything. But I’ll say again, if we do\nbelieve that it’s appropriate to go to those levels, we won’t hesitate.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Michael McKee.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Mike McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio. The balance\nsheet—why did you decide to wait until June 1st to begin letting securities roll off and not\nimmediately start in the middle of this month, say? And do you have another, a newer or a\nbetter, estimate for the monetary policy impact of letting the balance sheet decline? And then,\nfinally, I’m just curious why you felt the need to address the American people at the top of your\nremarks? Are you concerned about Fed credibility with the American people?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, why June 1? It was just, pick a date, you know, and that\nhappened to be the date that we picked. It was—nothing magic about it. You know, it’s not\ngoing to have any macroeconomic significance over time. We just picked that. Sometimes we\npublish these calendars on the first day of the month, and that’s what we’re doing. I wouldn’t\nread anything into it. In terms of the effect, I mean, I would just stress how uncertain the effect\nPage 19 of 24\nMay 4, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nis of shrinking the balance sheet. You know, we run these models—and everyone does in this\nfield—and make estimates of what will be, how do you measure, you know, a certain quantum of\nbalance sheet shrinkage compared to quantitative easing? And, you know, these are very\nuncertain. I really can’t be any clearer. There won’t be any clearer [estimates]. You know,\npeople estimate that, broadly, on the path we’re on—and this will be taken, probably, too\nseriously—but sort of ¼ percent, one rate increase over the course of a year at this pace. But I\nwould just say, with very wide uncertainty bands—very wide. We don’t really know. There are\nother estimates that are much smaller than that, by the way. And some of you may read about\nthat. That’s kind of a mainstream estimate. We know that it is part of returning to more normal,\nmore neutral financial conditions. And, you know, our strategy is to set up a plan and have it\noperate and really have, you know, have the interest rate be the active tool of monetary policy.\nIn terms of speaking to the American people, so I feel like sometimes I just want to remind us,\nreally, that that’s who we work for, and that it’s inflation that people are feeling all over the\ncountry. And it’s very important that they know that we know how painful it is and that we are\nworking hard on fixing it. I thought it was quite important to do that. And so that was really the\nthinking behind that.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Do you think the Fed has a credibility problem?\nCHAIR POWELL. No, I don’t. And a good example of why would be—in the fourth\nquarter of last year, as we started talking about tapering sooner and then raising rates this year,\nyou saw financial markets reacting, you know, very appropriately. Not to bless any particular\nday’s measure, but the way financial markets, the forward rate curve has tightened in response to\nour guidance and our actions really amplifies our policy. It’s—monetary policy is working\nthrough expectations now, to a very large extent. We’ve only done two rate increases. But if\nPage 20 of 24\nMay 4, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nyou look at financial conditions, the two-year [rate] is at 280 [basis points] now. In September, I\nthink it was at 20 basis points.\nAnd that’s all through the economy. People are feeling those higher rates already. And\nso that shows that the markets think that our forward guidance is credible. And I think we want\nto keep it that way.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Scott Horsley. [No response] Okay. Brian Cheung.\nBRIAN CHEUNG. Hi there. Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance. To expand on Steve’s\nquestion about Paul Volcker, there was also a great pain that came with that as well—higher\ninterest rates, obviously affecting households and businesses. I’m wondering how you kind of\nsquare what might be demand disruption. Are you already seeing that? Is the idea here to\nincentivize a lack of spending, to decrease consumption, to perhaps table business investments?\nIs that essentially what’s happening through this hiking cycle? Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, so, as I mentioned, you can see places where the demand is\nsubstantially in excess of supply. And what you’re seeing as a result of that is prices going up\nand at unsustainable levels, levels that are not consistent with 2 percent inflation. And so what\nour tools do is that as we raise interest rates, demand moderates: it moves down. Interest rates,\nyou know—businesses will invest a little bit less, consumers will spend a little bit less. That’s\nhow it works. But, ultimately, getting those, getting supply and demand back, you know, back in\nbalance, is what gives us 2 percent inflation, which is what gives the economy a footing where\npeople can lead successful economic lives and not worry about inflation. I mean, so, yes, there\nmay be some pain associated with getting back to that. But, you know, the big pain over time is\nin not dealing with inflation and allowing it to become entrenched.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Greg Robb.\nPage 21 of 24\nMay 4, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nGREG ROBB. Thank you. Thank you, Chair Powell. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. I\nwas wondering if you could take a step back and talk about, in March the dot plot had, you\nknow, looked like steady quarter-point rate hikes, get the funds rate up to 2 percent at the end of\nthe year. Now—where it seems like you’re much more aggressive. So could you talk about the\nthinking that’s behind that? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So, look, I think what you’ve seen is—really, I would say, in the\nmiddle of last fall—there was a time when our policy stance was still pretty much in sync with\nwhat the data were saying. If you remember, there were a couple of weak jobs reports. And\ninflation—month by month, inflation had come down till September, a few months in a row,\nstayed low. And then around the end of October, we got three or four really strong readings that\njust said, no, this is a much stronger economy. And by the way—then, with the restatement of\nthe jobs numbers, it looked like the job market was much more even and stronger in the second\nhalf of the year. But that hadn’t happened yet. Anyway, we got an ECI reading—employment\ncompensation, [employment cost] index reading—the Friday before the November meeting.\nThen we got a really strong jobs report. Then we got a really high CPI report. And so I think it\nbecame clear to the Committee that we needed to adjust and adapt. And we have. Ever since\nthen, really ever since then, we’ve been adapting. We, you know—the Committee moved by the\ntime of the December meeting to a median [in participants’ 2022 projections] of three rate\nincreases, then to a median of seven increases at the March meeting. And that process is going\non. And it’s clearly continuing. And that’s why I say—and I actually mentioned this at the\nMarch meeting—that no one should look at any single SEP as sort of a real resting place for 90\ndays, because we’re in a fast-evolving situation. And that’s what’s happened. You can see—\nunanimous vote today, of course. And I told you the guidance—that broad support on the\nPage 22 of 24\nMay 4, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCommittee to have 50-basis-point hikes on the table at the next couple of meetings. So you’re\nright. And by the way, other forecasters have been doing the same thing. And it’s just us\nadapting to the data and to the situation and using our tools to deal with it.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thanks. We’ll go to Nancy for the last question.\nNANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Hi. Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace. Chair\nPowell, I want to ask how you’re able to balance your dual mandate—stable prices and\nmaximum employment—especially when the unemployment rate for Black workers is still\nroughly double, roughly twice the rate for white workers.\nCHAIR POWELL. So unemployment rates for all racial groups have come down a lot\nand are now much closer to where they were before the pandemic hit. So that’s one thing I\nwould say. And that’s important. But the bigger point is this: I do not, at this time, see the two\nsides of the mandate as in tension. I don’t, because you can see that the labor market is out of\nbalance. You can see that there’s a labor shortage. There aren’t enough people to fill these job\nopenings. And companies can’t hire, and wages are moving up at levels that would not, over\ntime, be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time. And, of course, everyone loves to see\nwages go up. And it’s a great thing, but you want them to go up at a sustainable level, because\nthese wages are, to some extent, being eaten up by inflation. So, what that really means is, to get\nthe kind of labor market we really want to get, we really want to have a labor market that serves\nall Americans, especially the people in the lower-income part of the distribution, especially them.\nTo do that, you’ve got to have price stability. And we’ve got to get back to price stability so that\nwe can have a labor market where people’s wages aren’t being eaten up by inflation and where\nwe can have a long expansion, too. That’s—the good things you can have, as we have. We’ve\nhad—several of the longest expansions in U.S. history have been in the last 40 years, and that’s\nPage 23 of 24\nMay 4, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nbecause it’s been a time of low inflation. And long expansions are good for people and good for\nthe labor market. So that’s the way I think about it. I think we—you know, our tools work. We\nhave to think in the, in the medium and longer term. And I do think that the best thing for\neveryone is for us to get back to price stability to support, really, a sustained period of strong\nlabor market conditions. Thanks very much.\nPage 24 of 24"

Job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has\nremained low. Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances\nrelated to the pandemic, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures.\nThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic\nhardship. The invasion and related events are creating additional upward pressure on\ninflation and are weighing on global economic activity. In addition, COVID-related\nlockdowns in China are likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions. The\nCommittee is highly attentive to inflation risks.\nThe Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate\nof 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to\nraise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent and\nanticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate. In addition,\nthe Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency\ndebt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in the Plans for Reducing\nthe Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet that were issued in May. The\nCommittee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.\nIn assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will\ncontinue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic\noutlook.

    "press_conf": "June 15, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nTranscript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference\nJune 15, 2022\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. I will begin with one overarching message: We at\nthe Fed understand the hardship that high inflation is causing. We are strongly committed to\nbringing inflation back down, and we’re moving expeditiously to do so. We have both the tools\nwe need and the resolve that it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families\nand businesses. The economy and the country have been through a lot over the past two and a\nhalf years and have proved resilient. It is essential that we bring inflation down if we are to have\na sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.\nFrom the standpoint of our congressional mandate to promote maximum employment and\nprice stability, the current picture is plain to see: The labor market is extremely tight, and\ninflation is much too high. Against this backdrop, today the Federal Open Market Committee\nraised its policy interest rate by ¾ percentage point and anticipates that ongoing increases in that\nrate will be appropriate. In addition, we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the\nsize of our balance sheet. I’ll have more to say about today’s monetary policy actions after\nbriefly reviewing economic developments.\nOverall economic activity edged down in the first quarter, as unusually sharp swings in\ninventories and net exports more than offset continued strong underlying demand. Recent\nindicators suggest that real GDP growth has picked up this quarter, with consumption spending\nremaining strong. In contrast, growth in business fixed investment appears to be slowing, and\nactivity in the housing sector looks to be softening, in part reflecting higher mortgage rates. The\ntightening in financial conditions that we’ve seen in recent months should continue to temper\ngrowth and help bring demand into better balance with supply. As shown in our Summary of\nPage 1 of 27\nJune 15, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nEconomic Projections, FOMC participants have marked down their projections for economic\nactivity, with the median projection for real GDP growth running below 2 percent through 2024.\nThe labor market has remained extremely tight, with the unemployment rate near a\n50-year low, job vacancies at historical highs, and wage growth elevated. Over the past three\nmonths, employment rose by an average of 408,000 jobs per month, down from the average pace\nseen earlier in the year but still robust. Improvements in labor market conditions have been\nwidespread, including for workers at the lower end of the wage distribution as well as for\nAfrican Americans and Hispanics. Labor demand is very strong, while labor supply remains\nsubdued, with the labor force participation rate little changed since January. FOMC participants\nexpect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come into better balance, easing the\nupward pressures on wages and prices. The median projection in the SEP for the unemployment\nrate rises somewhat over the next few years, moving from 3.7 percent at the end of this year to\n4.1 percent in 2024, levels that are noticeably above the March projections.\nInflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. Over the 12 months\nending in April, total PCE prices rose 6.3 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy\ncategories, core prices rose 4.9 percent. In May, the 12-month change in the consumer price\nindex came in above expectations at 8.6 percent, and the change in the core CPI was 6 percent.\nAggregate demand is strong, supply constraints have been larger and longer lasting than\nanticipated, and price pressures have spread to a broad range of goods and services. The surge in\nprices of crude oil and other commodities that resulted from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is\nboosting prices for gasoline and food and is creating additional upward pressure on inflation.\nAnd COVID-related lockdowns in China are likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions.\nFOMC participants have revised up their projections for inflation this year, particularly for total\nPage 2 of 27\nJune 15, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nPCE inflation given developments in food and energy prices. The median projection is\n5.2 percent this year and falls to 2.6 percent next year and 2.2 percent in 2024. Participants\ncontinue to see risks to inflation as weighted to the upside.\nThe Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware\nthat high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher\ncosts of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We are highly attentive to the risks\nhigh inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning\ninflation to our 2 percent objective.\nAgainst the backdrop of the rapidly evolving economic environment, our policy has been\nadapting, and it will continue to do so. At today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target\nrange for the federal funds rate by ¾ percentage point, resulting in a 1½ percentage point\nincrease in the target range so far this year. The Committee reiterated that it anticipates that\nongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate. And we are continuing the process of\nsignificantly reducing the size of our balance sheet—which plays an important role in firming the\nstance of monetary policy.\nComing out of our last meeting in May, there was a broad sense on the Committee that a\n½ percentage point increase in the target range should be considered at this meeting if economic\nand financial conditions evolved in line with expectations. We also stated that we were highly\nattentive to inflation risks and that we would be nimble in responding to incoming data and the\nevolving outlook. Since then, inflation has again surprised to the upside, some indicators of\ninflation expectations have risen, and projections for inflation this year have been revised up\nnotably. In response to these developments, the Committee decided that a larger increase in the\nPage 3 of 27\nJune 15, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ntarget range was warranted at today’s meeting. This continues our approach of expeditiously\nmoving our policy rate up to more normal levels. And it will help ensure that longer-term\ninflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent.\nAs shown in the SEP, the median projection for the appropriate level of the federal funds\nrate is 3.4 percent at the end of this year, 1.5 percentage points higher than projected in March\nand 0.9 percentage point above the median estimate of its longer-run value. The median\nprojection rises further to 3.8 percent at the end of next year and declines to 3.4 percent in 2024,\nstill above the median longer-run value. Of course, these projections do not represent a\nCommittee plan or decision, and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a\nyear or more from now.\nOver coming months, we will be looking for compelling evidence that inflation is moving\ndown, consistent with inflation returning to 2 percent. We anticipate that ongoing rate increases\nwill be appropriate; the pace of those changes will continue to depend on the incoming data and\nthe evolving outlook for the economy. Clearly, today’s 75 basis point increase is an unusually\nlarge one, and I do not expect moves of this size to be common. From the perspective of today,\neither a 50 basis point or a 75 basis point increase seems most likely at our next meeting. We\nwill, however, make our decisions meeting by meeting, and we will continue to communicate\nour thinking as clearly as we can. Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation\nback down to our 2 percent goal and to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.\nMaking appropriate monetary policy in this uncertain environment requires a recognition\nthat the economy often evolves in unexpected ways. Inflation has obviously surprised to the\nupside over the past year, and further surprises could be in store. We therefore will need to be\nnimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook. And we will strive to avoid\nPage 4 of 27\nJune 15, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nadding uncertainty in what is already an extraordinarily challenging and uncertain time. We are\nhighly attentive to inflation risks and determined to take the measures necessary to restore price\nstability. The American economy is very strong and well positioned to handle tighter monetary\npolicy.\nTo conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and\nbusinesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the\nFed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.\nThank you. And I look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Howard.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thank you. Howard Schneider with Reuters. Two related\nquestions. Chair Powell, do you feel you boxed yourself in with the language you used at the\nlast press conference on 50 basis point hikes in June and July? And would you please give us as\ndetailed a sense as you can of what role you played in reshaping market expectations so quickly\non Monday?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, as you know, we always aim to provide as much clarity as we\ncan about our policy intentions subject to the inherent uncertainty in the economic outlook,\nbecause we think monetary policy is more effective when market participants understand how\npolicy will evolve, when they understand our objective function, our reaction function. And in\nthe current highly unusual circumstances with inflation well above our goal, we think it’s helpful\nto provide even more clarity than usual—again, subject to uncertainty in the outlook. And I\nthink over the course of this year, financial markets have responded and have, generally, shown\nthat they understand the path we’re laying out. Of course, it remains data dependent.\nPage 5 of 27\nJune 15, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nAnd so that’s what we generally think about guidance, and that’s why we offer it. And,\nof course, when we offered that—when I offered that guidance at the last meeting, I did say that\nit was subject to the economy performing about in line with expectations. I also said that if the\neconomy performed—if data came in worse than expected, then we would consider moving even\nmore aggressively. So we got the CPI data and also some data on inflation expectations late last\nweek, and we thought for a while, and we thought, well, this is the appropriate thing to do. So\nthen the question is, what do you do? And do you wait six weeks to do it at the next meeting?\nAnd I think the answer is, that’s not where we are with this. So we decided we needed to go\nahead, and so we did. And that’s really—that’s really how we made the decision.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Okay. Jeanna.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Thanks for taking our questions. Jeanna Smialek with the New\nYork Times. You—I guess I wonder if you could describe for us a little bit how you’re deciding\nhow aggressive you need to be. So, obviously, 75 today. What did 75 achieve that 50 wouldn’t\nhave, and why not just go for a full percentage point at some point?\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So if you take a step back, what we’re looking for is\ncompelling evidence that inflationary pressures are abating and that inflation is moving back\ndown. And we’d like to see that in the form of a series of declining monthly inflation readings—\nthat’s what we’re looking for. And, by this point, we had actually been expecting to see clear\nsigns of at least inflation flattening out and, ideally, beginning to decline. We’ve said that we’d\nbe data dependent, focused on incoming data, highly attentive to inflation risks—the things that I\nmentioned to Howard moments ago.\nSo contrary to expectations, inflation again surprised to the upside. Indicators—some\nindicators of inflation expectations have risen, and projections of [inflation] this year have\nPage 6 of 27\nJune 15, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nmoved up notably. So we thought that strong action was warranted at this meeting, and today we\ndelivered that in the form of a 75 basis point rate hike, as I mentioned. So the point of it, really,\nis this: We’ve been moving rates up expeditiously to more normal levels, and over the course of\nthe seven months since we pivoted and began moving in this direction, we’ve seen financial\nconditions tighten, and appropriately so. But the federal funds rate, even after this move, is at\n1.6 percent. So, again, the Committee is moving rates up expeditiously to more normal levels,\nand we came to the view that we’d like to do a little more front-end loading on that. So I think\nthat the SEP gives you the levels that people think are appropriate at given points in time. This\nwas really about the speed in which we would get there. So, as I mentioned, 75 basis points\ntoday—I said the next meeting could well be about a decision between 50 and 75. That would\nput us, at the end of the July meeting, in that range—in that more normal range, and that’s a\ndesirable place to be, because you begin to have more optionality there about the speed with\nwhich you would proceed going forward.\nJust talking about the SEP for a second: What it really says is that Committee\nparticipants widely would like to see policy at a modestly restricted—restrictive level at the end\nof this year. And that’s six months from now, and so much data [can accrue] and so much can\nhappen, so remember how highly uncertain this is. But so that is generally a range of 3 to 3½\npercent. That’s where people are, and that’s what they want to see, knowing what they know\nnow and understanding that we need to be—we need to show resolve but also be flexible [in\nresponding] to incoming data as we see it. If things are better, we don’t need to do that much,\nand if they’re not, then we either do that much or possibly even more. But in any case, it will be\nvery data dependent. Then you’re looking at next year, and what you’re seeing is, people see\nmore—a bit more tightening and a range of maybe 3½ to 4 percent. And that’s generally what\nPage 7 of 27\nJune 15, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\npeople see as the appropriate path for getting inflation under control and starting back down and\ngetting back down to 2 percent. So 75 basis points seemed like the right thing to do at this\nmeeting, and that’s what we did.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Thank you for taking my question, Mr.\nChairman. You have not used the phrase in a long time “monetary policy is in a good place,”\nwhich is a phrase that you used to use often. Now that the Committee is projecting 4 percent on\na—or 3.8 percent next year in terms of the funds rate, which is similar to where the market is\nnow, the futures market of 4 percent funds rate next year, do you think that’s a level that is going\nto be sufficiently high enough to deal with and bring down the inflation problem? And just as a\nfollow-up, could you break that apart for me? How much of that is restrictive, and how much of\nthat is a normal positive rate that ought to be embedded or not, in your opinion, in the funds rate?\nThank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So the question really is, how high does the rate really need to\ngo? And this is—the estimates on the Committee are in that range of 3½ to 4 percent. And how\ndo you think about that? Well, you can think about the longer-run neutral rate, you can compare\nit to that, and we think that’s in the mid-2s. You can look, frankly, at broader financial\nconditions. You can look at asset prices, you can look at the effect they’re having on the\neconomy, rates, asset prices, credit spreads—all of those things go into that. You can also look\nat the yield curve and ask, all along the yield curve, where is the policy rate? So for much of the\nyield curve now, real rates are positive. That’s not true at the short end. At the short end of the\nyield curve in the early years, you don’t have real—you have negative rates still.\nPage 8 of 27\nJune 15, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nSo that really is one data point—it’s one part of financial conditions. So I think—I have\nto look at it this way: We move the policy rate. That affects financial conditions. And that\naffects the economy. We have, of course, ways—rigorous ways to think about it, but, ultimately,\nit comes down to, do we think financial conditions are in a place where they’re having the\ndesired effect on the economy? And that desired affect is, we’d like to see demand moderating.\nDemand is very hot still in the economy. We’d like to see the labor market getting better in\nbalance between supply and demand, and that can happen [as a result of developments coming]\nboth from supply and demand. Right now, there’s—demand is substantially higher than\navailable supply, though, so we feel that there’s a role for us in moderating demand. Those are\nthe things we can affect with our policy tools. There are many things we can’t affect, and those\nwould be, you know, the things—the commodity price issues that we’re having around the world\ndue to the war in Ukraine and the fallout from that, and also just all of the supply-side things that\nare still pushing upward on inflation. So that’s really how I think—how I think about it.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. But does 3.8 percent, 4 percent get it done? Does it get the job done\non breaking the back of inflation?\nCHAIR POWELL. I think it’s certainly in the range of plausible numbers. I think we’ll\nknow when we get there really. I mean, honestly, though, that would be—you would have\npositive real rates, I think, and inflation coming down by then. I think you’d have positive real\nrates across the [yield] curve. I think that the neutral rate is pretty low these days. So I would\nthink it would, but you know what? We’re going to find that out empirically. We’re not going\nto be completely model driven about this. We’re going to be looking at this, keeping our eyes\nopen, and reacting to incoming data both on financial conditions and on what’s happening in the\neconomy.\nPage 9 of 27\nJune 15, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nick.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Thanks. Nick Timiraos. Chair Powell, you’ve said that you like\nyour policy to work through expectations. And now, obviously, this decision was something\nquite different from how you and almost all of your colleagues had set those expectations during\nthe intermeeting period. And I know you just said that what changed was really the inflation\ndata—the inflation expectations data. But I’m wondering, on the inflation expectations data, was\nthere something you saw that was unsettling enough to risk eroding the credibility of your verbal\nguidance by doing something so different from what you had “socialized” before?\nCHAIR POWELL. So if you look at a broad range of inflation expectations—so you’ve\ngot the public, you’ve got surveys of the public and of experts, and you’ve also got market based.\nAnd I think if you look across that broad range of data, what you see is that expectations are still\nin the place, very much in the place, where short-term inflation is going to be high but comes\ndown sharply over the next couple of years. And that’s really where inflation expectations are.\nAnd also, as you get away from this episode, they get back down close to 2 percent. And so this\nis really very important to us—that that remain the case. And I think if you look for most\nmeasures, most of the time, that’s what you see. If we even see a couple of indicators that bring\nthat into question, we take that very seriously. We do not take this for granted—we take it very\nseriously. So the preliminary Michigan [survey] reading—it’s a preliminary reading; it might be\nrevised—nonetheless, it was quite eye-catching, and we noticed that. We also noticed that the\nindex of common inflation expectations at the Board has moved up after being pretty flat for a\nlong time, so we’re watching that, and we’re thinking, “this is something we need to take\nseriously.” And that is one of the factors, as I mentioned—one of the factors in our deciding to\nmove ahead with 75 basis points today was what we saw in inflation expectations. We’re\nPage 10 of 27\nJune 15, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nabsolutely determined to keep them anchored at 2 percent. That was one of the reasons—the\nother was just the CPI reading.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. So if you saw a movement like that again, another tick-up in\ninflation expectations, would that put a 75 or even 100 basis point increase in play at your next\nmeeting?\nCHAIR POWELL. We’re going to—I’ll just say, we’re going to react to the incoming\ndata and appropriately, I think. So I wouldn’t want to put a number on what that might be. The\nmain thing is to get rates up, and then pretty soon, we’ll be in an area where we’re—I think as\nyou get closer to the end of the year, you’re in a range where you’ve got restrictive policy, which\nis appropriate. Forty-year highs in inflation—we think that policy is going to need to be\nrestrictive, and we don’t know how restrictive. So I think that’s how we’ll take it.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Neil.\nNEIL IRWIN. Hi, Chair Powell. Neil Irwin from Axios. Thanks for taking our\nquestions. The late-breaking kind of decision to go to 75 basis points—do you worry that that\nwill make policy guidance a less effective tool in the future? And should we think of that as a\nkind of symmetrical reaction function if we start to get soft readings on inflation or if the labor\nmarket starts to roll over?\nCHAIR POWELL. To take your second question first, yes. I mean, I think we’re—\nagain, we’re going, we’re resolved to take this on, but we’re going to be flexible in the\nimplementation of it. Sorry—and your [first] question was [about] guidance. So, again, the\noverall exercise is that we try to be—provide as much clarity about our policy intentions as we\ncan, because we think that makes monetary policy work better. There’s always a tradeoff,\nbecause you have to live with that guidance, and so you do it, and it helps a lot of the time. I,\nPage 11 of 27\nJune 15, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nfrankly, think this year has been a demonstration of how well it can work. With us having really\njust done very little in the way of raising interest rates, financial conditions have tightened quite\nsignificantly through the expectations channel, as we’ve made it clear what our plans are. So I\nthink that’s been a very healthy thing to be happening. And I would hope that our—it’s always\ngoing to be—any guidance that we give is always going to be subject to things working out\nabout as we expect. And, in this particular situation, you know, we’re looking for something\nspecific, and that is progress on inflation. We want to see progress. We want to see—inflation\ncan’t go down until it flattens out, and that’s what we’re looking to see. And if we don’t see that,\nthen that’s the kind of thing that will—even if we don’t see progress for a longer period, that\ncould cause us to react. But we will. Soon enough, we will be seeing some progress at some\npoint. And we’ll react [as] appropriate to that, too. But I would like to think, though, that our\nguidance is still credible, but it’s always going to be conditional on what happens. This is an\nunusual situation, to get, you know, some data late in, during blackout, pretty close to—very\nclose to our meeting. Very unusual to [have] one that would actually change the outcome. So\nI’ve only seen—in my 10-years-plus here at the Fed, I’ve only seen something like that, even\nclose to that, one or two times. So I don’t think it’s something that’ll come up a great deal.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Colby.\nCOLBY SMITH. Thank you so much for taking our questions. Colby Smith with the\nFinancial Times. On the “clear and convincing” threshold for the inflation trajectory, what is the\nlevel of realized inflation that meets that criteria? And how is the Committee thinking about the\npotential tradeoff of much higher unemployment than even in what’s forecasted in the SEP if\ninflation is not moderating at this acceptable pace?\nCHAIR POWELL. The second part I didn’t get.\nPage 12 of 27\nJune 15, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCOLBY SMITH. What’s the potential tradeoff with higher unemployment than even\nwhat’s forecasted in the SEP if inflation is not moderating at an acceptable pace?\nCHAIR POWELL. Right. So, what we want to see is a series of declining monthly\nreadings for inflation, and we’d like to see inflation headed down. But, you know—and right\nnow, our policy rate is well below neutral, right? So, soon enough, we’ll have our policy rate—\nlet’s assume the world works out about like the SEP says: The policy rate will be up where we\nthink it should be. And then the question would be: Do you slow down? Does it make you—\nyou’ll be making these judgments about, is it appropriate now to slow down—from 50 to 25,\nlet’s say—or speed up? So that’s the kind of thinking we’ll be doing, and, again, we’re\nlooking—ultimately, we’re not going to declare victory until we see a series of these, really see\nconvincing evidence, compelling evidence, that inflation is coming down. And that’s what I\nmean by—that’s what it would take for us to say, “Okay, we think this job is done.” Because we\nsaw—and, frankly, we saw last year—inflation came down over the course of the summer and\nthen turned right around and went back up. So I think we’re going to be careful about declaring\nvictory. But our—again, the implementation of our policy is going to be flexible and sensitive to\nincoming data.\nCOLBY SMITH. Are you more concerned now that to bring down inflation, it’s going to\nrequire more than just some pain at this point?\nCHAIR POWELL. Again, I think that—I do think that our objective, and this is what’s\nreflected in the SEP, but our objective, really, is to bring inflation down to 2 percent while the\nlabor market remains strong. I think that what’s becoming more clear is that many factors that\nwe don’t control are going to play a very significant role in deciding whether that’s possible or\nnot. And there I’m thinking, of course, of commodity prices, the war in Ukraine, supply chain\nPage 13 of 27\nJune 15, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\n[developments], things like that, where we really—the monetary policy stance doesn’t affect\nthose things. But having said that, there is a path for us to get there—it’s not getting easier; it’s\ngetting more challenging because of these external forces—and that path is to move demand\ndown, and you have a lot of surplus demand. Take, for example, in the labor market. So you\nhave two job vacancies, essentially, for every person actively seeking a job, and that has led to a\nreal imbalance in wage negotiating. You could get to a place where that ratio was at a more\nnormal level, and you wouldn’t—you would expect to see those wage pressures move back\ndown to a level where people are still getting healthy wage increases, real wage increases, but at\na level that’s consistent with 2 percent inflation. So that’s a possibility. And you could say the\nsame thing about some of the product markets where there’s just excess capacity and really\nwhere the strong demand has gone into—sorry, where they’re capacity constrained, right? So\nyou have, effectively, what we think of as a vertical supply curve or close to it. So demand\ncomes in, and it’s very strong, and it shows up in higher prices—not higher quantities, not more\ncars, because they can’t make the cars because they don’t have the semiconductors. So in\nprinciple, that could work in reverse. When demand comes down, you could see—and it’s not\nguaranteed—but you could see prices coming down more than the typical economic relationships\nthat you see in the textbooks would suggest, because of the unusual situation we’re in on the\nsupply side. So there’s a pathway there. It is not going to be easy, and there—again, it’s our\nobjective, but, as I mentioned, it’s going to depend to some extent on factors we don’t control.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Rachel.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you for taking our questions. Rachel\nSiegel from the Washington Post. So the new projections show the unemployment rate ticking\nup through 2024. Is a higher unemployment rate necessary in order to combat inflation? And\nPage 14 of 27\nJune 15, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nwhat is lost if the unemployment rate has to go up and people lose their jobs in order to control\ninflation? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So you’re right. In the SEP, we have unemployment going up to\n4 point—the median is 4.1 percent—of course, [there is] a range of actual forecasts. And I\nwould characterize that, if you were to get inflation down to, you know, on its way down to 2\npercent and the unemployment rate went up to 4.1 percent, that’s still a historically low level.\nWe hadn’t seen—we hadn’t seen rates, unemployment rates below 4 percent until a couple years\nago for—we’d seen it for, like, one year in the last 50. So the idea that—3.6 percent is\nhistorically low in the last century. So a 4.1 percent unemployment rate with inflation well on its\nway to 2 percent—I think that would be—I think that would be a successful outcome. So we’re\nnot looking to have a higher unemployment rate. But I would say that I would certainly look at\nthat as a successful outcome.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Would that include people losing their jobs?\nCHAIR POWELL. We’re not—again, we’re not, we don’t seek to put people out of\nwork, of course. We never think, “Too many people are working, and fewer people need to have\njobs.” But we also think that you really cannot have the kind of labor market we want without\nprice stability. And we have to go back and establish price stability so we can have that kind of\nlabor market, and that’s a labor market where workers are getting wage increases—maybe the\nworkers at the lower end of the spectrum are getting the biggest wage increases, as they were\nbefore the pandemic—where participation is high, where there’s lots of job opportunities, where\nit’s just a really—I mean, the labor market we had before the pandemic was—that’s what we\nwant to get back to. And you see disparities between various groups at historic lows. We’d love\nto get back to that place. But, to get there—it’s not going to happen with the levels of inflation\nPage 15 of 27\nJune 15, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nwe have. So we have to restore that, and it really is in service, in the medium and longer term, of\nthe kind of labor market we want and hope to achieve.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Matt.\nMATTHEW BOESLER. Hi, Chair Powell. Matthew Boesler with Bloomberg. So, as\nyou just mentioned, the Committee is now projecting a ½ percentage point rise in the\nunemployment rate and the SEPs over the next couple of years, and it removed a line from its\npolicy statement about thinking that the labor market can remain strong while it tightens policy.\nYou just mentioned that that is still your objective, though, so I’m wondering if you could\nexplain why that line was removed from the statement—also whether this means the FOMC is\ntrying to induce a recession now to bring inflation down.\nCHAIR POWELL. Not trying to induce a recession now. Let’s be clear about that.\nWe’re trying to achieve 2 percent inflation consistent with a strong labor market. That’s what\nwe’re trying to do. So let me talk about that sentence. Clearly, it’s our goal to bring about\n2 percent inflation while keeping the labor market strong, right? And that’s kind of what the\nSEP says. The SEP has inflation getting down to 2, a little above 2 percent in 2024, with\nunemployment at 4.1 percent. And this is a strong labor market—this is a good labor market.\nAnd, as I mentioned, there are pathways to do it. But those pathways have become much more\nchallenging due to factors that are not under our control. Again, thinking here of the fallout from\nthe war in Ukraine, which has brought a spike in prices of energy, food, fertilizer, industrial\nchemicals, and also just the supply chains more broadly, which have been larger and longer\nlasting than anticipated. So the sentence that we deleted said that we believe that appropriate\nmonetary policy, effectively alone, can bring about the result of 2 percent inflation with a strong\nlabor market. And so much of it is really not down to monetary policy. It just didn’t—the\nPage 16 of 27\nJune 15, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nsentence isn’t—it kind of says on its face that monetary policy alone can do this. And that’s\nnot—that just didn’t seem appropriate, so we took the sentence out.\nMATTHEW BOESLER. And given the new projections for the unemployment rate,\ncould you talk a little bit about what accounts for such reduced confidence against, say, a month\nago or three months ago that inflation will largely normalize on its own as these supply-side\nissues get worked out? Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, yeah, I think you’ve seen—again, we’ve been expecting\nprogress, and we didn’t get that. We got sort of the opposite. So I also think the situation,\nreally—since the consequences of the Ukraine war become more and more clear, what you’re\nseeing is the situation getting more difficult. And you look around the world—I mean, lots of\ncountries are—lots of countries are looking at inflation of 10 percent, and it’s largely due to\ncommodities prices. But all over the world, you’re seeing these effects. And so—and we’re\nseeing them here: gas prices at all-time highs, and things like that. That’s not something we can\ndo something about. So that is really—and, by the way, headline inflation, headline inflation is\nimportant for expectations. People—the public’s expectations, why would they be\ndistinguishing between core inflation and headline inflation? Core inflation is something we [on\nthe Committee] think about because it is a better predictor of future inflation. But headline\ninflation is what people experience. They don’t know what core is. Why would they? They\nhave no reason to. So that’s—expectations are very much at risk due to high headline inflation.\nSo it’s become—the environment has become more difficult, clearly, in the last four or five\nmonths, and hence the need for the policy actions that we took today. Hence our resolution to\nget rates up and, ultimately, get them to where we think they need to be in coming months.\nPage 17 of 27\nJune 15, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thanks, Chair Powell. Edward Lawrence with Fox Business.\nI wanted to ask you—you talked about CPI going to 8.6 percent, that retail sales surprised the\nmarket by falling and then revisions to the previous months were down. Are you hearing from\ncontacts about consumers slowing spending or changing their habits?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we’re, of course, watching very, very carefully for that and\nlooking at the retail—the big store numbers and all that kind of thing. And so I—but I think the\nfair summary of what we see is, you see continuing shifts in consumption, you see some things\ngetting—sales going down, but overall spending is very strong. The consumer’s in really good\nshape financially. They’re spending. There’s no sign of a broader slowdown that I can see in the\neconomy. People are talking about it a lot—consumer confidence is very low. That’s probably\nrelated to gas prices and also just stock prices to some extent for other people. But that’s what\nwe’re seeing. We’re not seeing a broad slowdown. We see job growth slowing, but it’s still at\nquite robust levels. We see the economy slowing a bit but still growth levels—healthy growth\nlevels.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. So then as you are raising rates in this economy, how closely\nare you watching consumer spending, or is there something—another indicator that you’re\nwatching more closely?\nCHAIR POWELL. It would be hard to watch anything much more closely than we\nwatch consumer spending, but we watch everything. We watch business fixed investment,\nwhich actually has softened a bit. And we watch—we’re responsible for watching everything.\nConsumption is 60-some percent of the economy, two-thirds of the economy, so, naturally, we\nspend a lot of time on that. And, again, there’s a lot going on—there are a lot of flows back and\nPage 18 of 27\nJune 15, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nforth—but, ultimately, it does appear that the U.S. economy is in a strong position and well\npositioned to deal with higher interest rates.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Michael McKee.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Michael McKee from Bloomberg\nRadio and Television. Are you targeting headline inflation now or core inflation? In other\nwords, how far would you chase oil prices if they keep going up? If that’s going to be the\ncomponent that drives expectations, would you risk recession for a headline rate if the core rate\nis holding steady or starting to go down?\nCHAIR POWELL. So the—we’re responsible for inflation in the law. And inflation\nmeans headline inflation. So that’s our ultimate goal. We, of course, like all central banks do,\nlook very, very carefully at core inflation because it is—it’s a much better predictor, and it’s\nmuch—it’s a much better predictor of where inflation is going, and it’s also more relevant to our\ntools. As I mentioned, the parts that don’t go into core are mostly outside the scope of our tools,\nso we look at that. But it’s—the current situation is particularly difficult because of what I\nmentioned about expectations. We can’t affect, really—I mean, the energy prices are set by\nglobal commodity prices. And most of food—not all of it, but most food prices are pretty\nheavily influenced by global commodity prices, too. Also other things. So we can’t really have\nmuch of an effect. But we have to be mindful of the potential effect on inflation expectations\n[coming] from headline [inflation readings]. So it’s a very difficult situation to be in, and we—\nagain, we can’t do much about the difference between [headline and core inflation rates due to]\nthe elements that make up headline that are not in core.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Could I just, as a follow-up, get a clarification on the SEP? When\nthe members gave their forecasts, when were they inserted into the record? Were they revised\nPage 19 of 27\nJune 15, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nafter the CPI or Michigan numbers came out? In other words, does the SEP, as we have it now,\nreflect the same factors that led you to go to a 75 basis point move?\nCHAIR POWELL. The SEP is of one piece. It reflects all of the economic readings. It\nalso reflects the 75 basis point increase. This is important. So people had that in hand when\nthey—when their SEPs were submitted. So it’s—in other words, it’s not in addition to what’s in\nthe SEP. The SEP—everyone’s SEP reflects their thinking about this rate increase and what’s\ngoing forward.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Victoria Guida from Politico. I wanted to ask about how\nyou’re measuring progress, especially since you’ve now started front-loading rate hikes more.\nYou’ve talked about how you want to see inflation coming down over a series of reports, and I\nguess I’m curious whether you think inflation data itself is a really good indicator or whether you\nmight be concerned that it’s a lagging indicator or that it might send confusing signals given that,\nas you’ve talked about, there are sort of supply and demand aspects. And I guess my question is,\ndo you think that inflation will tell you—inflation data will tell you when you’ve gone to where\nyou need to go, or do you just feel like maybe it’s better to overshoot than to undershoot?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think the role that we can play—maybe the way to get at this is\nto say that the role that we can play is around demand, right? And we’ll be able to see—the\nareas that we can affect are those associated with excess demand, and we’ll be able to see our\neffect on, for example, job openings in real time. And that would tell us what’s—that would tell\nus about wages. Wages are not principally responsible for the inflation that we’re seeing, but,\ngoing forward, they would be very important, particularly in the service sector. Sorry, I’m not\nsure I’m getting to your question.\nPage 20 of 27\nJune 15, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nVICTORIA GUIDA. My question is, is inflation data itself the best indicator for when\nyou’re getting to where you need to go, or might it lead you to go too far?\nCHAIR POWELL. There’s always a risk of going too far or going not far enough, and\nit’s going to be a very difficult judgment to make, or maybe not—maybe it’ll be really clear. But\nwe’re—and we’re quite mindful of the dangers. But I will say, the worst mistake we could make\nwould be to fail, which—it’s not an option. We have to restore price stability. We really do,\nbecause everything—it’s the bedrock of the economy. If you don’t have price stability, the\neconomy’s really not going to work the way it’s supposed to. It won’t work for people—their\nwages will be eaten up. So we want to get the job done. This inflation happened relatively\nrecently. We don’t think that it’s affecting expectations in any kind of fundamental way. We\ndon’t think that we’re seeing a wage–price spiral. We think that the public generally sees us as\nvery likely to be successful in getting inflation down to 2 percent, and that’s critical. It’s\nabsolutely key to the whole thing that we sustain that confidence. So that’s how we’re thinking\nabout it.\nBRIAN CHEUNG. Hi, Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance. I just want to expand, I\nguess, on what you just said now about the general public feeling like you can get this done.\nYou talk about consumer sentiment being down, also inflation expectations being up, recession\njust broadly being dinner table talk. Does the general feel among American households and also\nbusinesses square with your explanation of the economy, given that the description of inflation in\nthe statement didn’t change between May and June? Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. So, clearly, people don’t like inflation—a lot. And many people are\nexperiencing it, really, for the first time, because we haven’t had anything like this kind of\ninflation in 40 years. And it’s really something people don’t like. And they’re experiencing that,\nPage 21 of 27\nJune 15, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nand that’s showing up in their—in surveys and in all kinds of ways. And we understand that, and\nwe understand the hardship that people are experiencing from high inflation, and we’re\ndetermined to do what we can to get inflation back down. So that’s really what we’re saying.\nWe’re not—I’m not—clearly, it’s an incredibly unpopular thing, and it’s very painful for people.\nI guess what I’m saying is, the question, the really critical question from the perspective of doing\nour job is making sure that the public does have confidence that we have the tools and will use\nthem and they do work to bring inflation back down over time. It will take some time, we think,\nto get inflation back down, but we will do that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Chris.\nCHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Thank you. Chris Rugaber, Associated Press. You have\ntalked about inflation a few times and mentioned oil prices, China lockdowns. But aside from\nrises in commodity prices such as gas prices, we’re also seeing stickier measures of inflation\nincreasing, such as the Cleveland Fed’s median and trimmed mean CPIs. I mean, how persistent\ndo you see those underlying measures of inflation, and how do you expect to—where do you see\nthose going in the near future?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, as I mentioned, I think, in my opening statement, inflation has\nstarted—it started off in quite narrow, very directly pandemic-related areas, and it’s spread now\nbroadly across the economy and into the services sector as well. It was really in the goods sector\nat the beginning. And, particularly, you’re seeing in travel now, if you’ve flown on a plane\nlately—planes are very full, and plane tickets are very expensive. Some of that will be pass-\nthrough of energy prices, but it’s—so you’re experiencing services inflation. Shelter inflation is\nhigh. So the question—and then you see the Cleveland measure going up, and many other\nmeasures are going up. So it’s a time when we’re not seeing progress and we want to see\nPage 22 of 27\nJune 15, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nprogress, and that’s really another part of why we did what we did today and why the SEP looks\nlike it does. We see it as appropriate to get the policy rate up to restrictive levels, which would\nbe, in the thinking of the Committee, somewhere in the range of 3 to 3½ percent by year-end.\nAnd then after that, you see what the rest of the SEP says. So I hope that’s responsive to your\nquestion.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nancy.\nNANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Hi, Chair Powell. Nancy Marshall-Genzer with\nMarketplace. Do you still think a softish landing is possible, and how would you define that at\nthis point considering the revised projections for unemployment, GDP, inflation?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think what’s in the SEP would certainly meet that test. If you\nsee—you’re looking at getting back down to almost a 2 percent inflation by 2024, and the\nunemployment rate is still as low as 4.1 percent. That would be—I would call that as meeting\nthat test. Do I still think that we can do that? I do. I think there’s—I think there’s—I don’t want\nto be the handicapper here. I just—that is our objective, and I do think it’s possible. Like I said,\nthough, I think that events of the last few months have raised the degree of difficulty, created\ngreat challenges. And, again, the answer to the question, can we still do it—there’s a much\nbigger chance now that it’ll depend on factors that we don’t control, which is, fluctuations and\nspikes in commodity prices could wind up taking that option out of our hands. So we just don’t\nknow, but we’re focused on—very, very focused on getting inflation back down to 2 percent,\nwhich we think is essential for the benefit of the public and also to put us on a path back to a\nsustainably strong labor market like the one we had before the pandemic.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Greg.\nPage 23 of 27\nJune 15, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nGREG ROBB. Thank you. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. Chair Powell, I was\nwondering if you could talk a little bit more—economists are worried that you’re kind of hitting\nthe economy with a sledgehammer and that now there’s even more risk of a recession than a\n50–50 path of rates. So could you talk a little bit more about that? And what evidence would get\nyou to stop rate hikes and maybe even reverse them?\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So, as I mentioned, financial conditions have tightened over\nthe last seven months, and that’s a good thing, we think. But the federal funds rate, even after\nthis increase, is at 1.6 percent. So it’s hard to see how that is too high of a rate. And even if we\ndid another—so we’re going to get here by the end of the summer, somewhere in the 2s\nprobably. Still, that’s still a low rate. So that’s not a rate that is calculated to bring a recession\non. And we’ll—by then, we’ll have seen a whole lot more data. As I mentioned a couple times,\nthe Committee’s views are around a modestly restrictive stance, which will be in the 3 to\n3½ percent range by the end of this year, but that’s conditioned on that being the appropriate\nthing to do. If we see data going in a different direction, it’ll be reflected in our policy, as you\nsee today. We’ll be watching—if things go in a direction we don’t expect, then we’re going to\nadapt. And I would say, this is a highly uncertain environment—extraordinarily uncertain\nenvironment. So, again, we’ll be determined and resolved, but flexible.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Okay. Evan.\nEVAN RYSER. Evan Ryser, Market News International. Thank you, Chair Powell. I\nwas wondering if the Fed has initiated a review of the conduct of monetary policy over the last\ntwo years or so, given the inflation, and will that be shared with the public? And then, secondly,\ngiven the illiquidity and the extraordinary volatility in financial markets, are you concerned that\nQT will make that worse?\nPage 24 of 27\nJune 15, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. Sorry, what was your question on QT?\nEVAN RYSER. Just given the illiquidity and extraordinary volatility in financial\nmarkets, whether QT will make things worse.\nCHAIR POWELL. So, of course, we’ve been looking very carefully and hard at why\ninflation picked up so much more than expected last year and why it proved so persistent. We—\nit’s hard to overstate the extent of interest we have in that question morning, noon, and night.\nBut you have to understand the context. For—really, the context is this: For decades before the\npandemic and the reopening, you had a world where inflation was dominated by disinflationary\nforces such as declining population or aging demographics, let’s call it that, globalization\nenabled by technology, other factors, low productivity. So and that’s how all the models work is,\ndecades and decades of data—they look at that. It’s a very flat Philips curve world, and the\nsupply shocks tend to be transient, right? So we have now experienced an extraordinary series of\nshocks, if you think about it: the pandemic, the response, the reopening, inflation, followed by\nthe war in Ukraine, followed by shutdowns in China—the war in Ukraine potentially having\neffects for years here. So we’re aware that a different set of forces are driving the economy—we\nhave been, obviously, for quite a while. But this is a different—these forces are different.\nInflation is behaving differently, and, in our thinking, it really is a question of very strong\ndemand. But you couldn’t get this kind of inflation without a change on the supply side, which\nis there for anybody to see, which is these blockages and shortages and people dropping out of\nthe labor force and things like that. So that’s how we’re looking at it.\nAnd we’ve done a lot of work internally on, and thinking about, what all that means.\nYou don’t—the thing is, you don’t know whether those forces are—to what extent are they going\nto be sustained? In other words, will we go back to a world where it looks a little more like the\nPage 25 of 27\nJune 15, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nold world, or are we really going to be in a world where major supply shocks go on and on? The\nhistory is, you see these waves of supply shocks, as you did in the ’70s, and then they go away,\nand sort of there’s a “new normal,” and things settle down. But, honestly, we don’t know what\nthat’s going to be. In the meantime, we have to find price stability in this new world and\nmaximum employment in this new world where, clearly, inflationary forces are—you’re seeing\nthem everywhere. Again, if you look around the world at where inflation levels are, it’s\nabsolutely extraordinary. It’s not just here. In fact, we’re sort of in the middle of the pack,\nalthough I think we have, of course, a different kind of inflation than other people have, partly\nbecause our economy is stronger and more highly recovered. So that’s what we’re doing.\nWe’ve done a lot of introspection and work on that and—sorry, on QT, we’ve communicated\nreally clearly to the markets about what we’re going to do there. Markets seem to be okay with\nit. We’re phasing in—Treasury [security] issuance is down quite a lot, quite a lot from where\nit’s been, so I have no reason to think—markets are forward looking, and they see this coming. I\nhave no reason to think it will lead to illiquidity and problems. It seems to be kind of understood\nand accepted at this point.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thanks. For the last question, we’ll go to Mark Hamrick.\nMARK HAMRICK. Mr. Chairman, Mark Hamrick with Bankrate. I wonder what your\nassessment is about the outlook for the housing market, given the years-long increase in home\nprices and now the sharp rise in mortgage rates. And all that, of course, given the heightened\nsensitivity around the housing market given the fact that it was a trigger for the great financial\ncrisis over a decade ago. Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So rates were very low—a good place to start is that rates were\nvery, very low for quite a while because of the pandemic and the need to do everything we could\nPage 26 of 27\nJune 15, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nto support the economy when unemployment was 14 percent and the true unemployment rate\nwas well higher than that. And that was a—rates are low, and now they’re coming back up to\nmore normal, or above, levels. So, in the meantime, while rates were low and while demand was\nreally high, obviously demand for housing changed from wanting to live in urban areas to some\nextent to living in single-family homes in the suburbs, famously. And so the demand was just\nsuddenly much higher. And we saw prices moving up very, very strongly for the last couple of\nyears. So that changes now, and rates have moved up—we’re well aware that mortgage rates\nhave moved up a lot—and you’re seeing a changing housing market. We’re watching it to see\nwhat will happen. How much will it really affect residential investment? Not really sure. How\nmuch will it affect housing prices? Not really sure. It’s—I mean, obviously, we’re watching\nthat quite carefully. You would think over time—I mean, so there’s a tremendous amount of\nsupply in the housing market of unfinished homes, and as those come on line—whereas the\nsupply of finished homes, inventory of finished homes that are for sale, is incredibly low,\nhistorically low. So it’s still a very tight market. So prices may keep going up for a while even\nin a world where rates are up. So it’s a complicated situation. We watch it very carefully. I\nwould say if you’re a homebuyer, somebody or a young person looking to buy a home, you need\na bit of a reset. We need to get back to a place where supply and demand are back together and\nwhere inflation is down low again and mortgage rates are low again. So this will be a process\nwhereby we—ideally, we do our work in a way that the housing market settles in a new place\nand housing availability and credit availability are at appropriate levels.\nSo thank you very much.\nPage 27 of 27"

My colleagues and I are strongly committed to\nbringing inflation back down, and we’re moving expeditiously to do so. We have both the tools\nwe need and the resolve it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and\nbusinesses.\nThe economy and the country have been through a lot over the past two and a half years\nand have proved resilient. It is essential that we bring inflation down to our 2 percent goal if we\nare to have a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.\nFrom the standpoint of our congressional mandate to promote maximum employment and\nprice stability, the current picture is plain to see: The labor market is extremely tight, and\ninflation is much too high. Against this backdrop, today the FOMC raised its policy interest rate\nby ¾ of a percentage point and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range for the\nfederal funds rate will be appropriate. In addition, we are continuing the process of significantly\nreducing the size of our balance sheet. And I’ll have more to say about today’s monetary policy\nactions after briefly reviewing economic developments.\nRecent indicators of spending and production have softened. Growth in consumer\nspending has slowed significantly, in part reflecting lower real disposable income and tighter\nfinancial conditions. Activity in the housing sector has weakened, in part reflecting higher\nmortgage rates. And after a strong increase in the first quarter, business fixed investment also\nlooks to have declined in the second quarter.\nDespite these developments, the labor market has remained extremely tight, with the\nunemployment rate near a 50-year low, job vacancies near historical highs, and wage growth\nelevated. Over the past three months, employment rose by an average of 375,000 jobs per\nPage 1 of 29\nJuly 27, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nmonth—down from the average pace seen earlier in the year, but still robust. Improvements in\nlabor market conditions have been widespread, including for workers at the lower end of the\nwage distribution as well as for African Americans and Hispanics. Labor demand is very strong,\nwhile labor supply remains subdued, with the labor force participation rate little changed since\nJanuary. Overall, the continued strength of the labor market suggests that underlying aggregate\ndemand remains solid.\nInflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. Over the 12 months\nending in May, total PCE prices rose 6.3 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy\ncategories, core PCE prices rose 4.7 percent. In June, the 12-month change in the consumer\nprice index came in above expectations at 9.1 percent, and the change in the core CPI was\n5.9 percent. Notwithstanding the recent slowdown in overall economic activity, aggregate\ndemand appears to remain strong, supply constraints have been larger and longer lasting than\nanticipated, and price pressures are evident across a broad range of goods and services.\nAlthough prices for some commodities have turned down recently, the earlier surge in prices of\ncrude oil and other commodities that resulted from Russia’s war on Ukraine has boosted prices\nfor gasoline and food, creating additional upward pressure on inflation.\nThe Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware\nthat high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher\ncosts of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We are highly attentive to the risks\nhigh inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning\ninflation to our 2 percent objective.\nPage 2 of 29\nJuly 27, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nAt today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by\n¾ of a percentage point, bringing the target range to 2¼ to 2½ percent. And we’re continuing\nthe process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet, which plays an important role\nin firming the stance of monetary policy.\nOver coming months, we will be looking for compelling evidence that inflation is moving\ndown, consistent with inflation returning to 2 percent. We anticipate that ongoing increases in\nthe target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate; the pace of those increases will\ncontinue to depend on the incoming data and the evolving outlook for the economy. Today’s\nincrease is the—in the target range is the second 75 basis point increase in as many meetings.\nWhile another unusually large increase could be appropriate at our next meeting, that is a\ndecision that will depend on the data we get between now and then. We will continue to make\nour decisions meeting by meeting and communicating—and communicate our thinking as clearly\nas possible. As the stance of monetary policy tightens further, it likely will become appropriate\nto slow the pace of increases while we assess how our cumulative policy adjustments are\naffecting the economy and inflation. Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring demand\ninto better balance with supply in order to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to\nkeep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.\nMaking appropriate monetary policy in this uncertain environment requires a recognition\nthat the economy often involves—evolves in unexpected ways. Inflation has obviously surprised\nto the upside over the past year, and further surprises could be in store. We therefore will need\nto be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook. And we will strive to\navoid adding uncertainty in what is already an extraordinarily challenging and uncertain time.\nWe are highly attentive to inflation risks and determined to take the measures necessary to return\nPage 3 of 29\nJuly 27, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ninflation to our 2 percent longer-run goal. This process is likely to involve a period of below-\ntrend economic growth and some softening in labor market conditions. But such outcomes are\nlikely necessary to restore price stability and to set the stage for achieving maximum\nemployment and stable prices over the longer run.\nTo conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and\nbusinesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the\nFed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.\nThank you. I look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s start with Rachel.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Hi, Chair Powell. Thanks for taking our questions. Rachel Siegel\nfrom the Washington Post. I’m wondering if you can walk us through your thinking around the\ndecision not to go for a full percentage point increase. We saw a ramp-up after the May CPI\nreport came in hotter than usual and then, obviously, the June figure did, too. Was there any\ndiscussion of a stronger hike at this meeting? Yes. Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So we did judge that a 75 basis point increase was the right\nmagnitude in light of the data and in the context of the ongoing increases in the policy rate that\nwe’ve been making. I’d say that we wouldn’t hesitate to, to make an even larger move than we\ndid today if the Committee were to conclude that that was—that that were appropriate. That was\nnot the case at this meeting. There was very broad support for the move that we made.\nYou mentioned the—the June meeting. We, we had said many times that we were\nprepared to move aggressively, more aggressively, if inflation continued to disappoint. And\nthat’s why we did move to a more aggressive pace at the June meeting, as we said we would do.\nPage 4 of 29\nJuly 27, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nAt this meeting, we continued at that more aggressive pace, as inflation has continued to\ndisappoint, in the form of the June CPI reading.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Colby.\nCOLBY SMITH. Thank you so much for taking our questions. Colby Smith with the\nFinancial Times. As the Committee considers the policy path forward, how will it weigh the\nexpected decline in headline inflation, which might come as a result of the drop in commodity\nprices, against the fact that we are likely to see some persistence in core readings, in particular?\nAnd given that potential tension and signs of, you know, any kind of activity weakening here,\nhow has the Committee’s thinking changed on how far into restrictive territory rates might need\nto go?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I guess I’d start by saying we’ve been saying we would move\nexpeditiously to get to the range of neutral. And I think we’ve done that now. We’re at—we’re\nat 2.25 to 2.5 [percent], and that’s right in the range of what we think is neutral. So the question\nis, how are we thinking about the path forward? So one thing that hasn’t changed is that—won’t\nchange—is that our focus is continuing to—is going to continue to be on using our tools to bring\ndemand back into better balance with supply in order to bring inflation back down. That’ll\ncontinue to be our overarching focus.\nWe also said that we expect ongoing rate hikes will be appropriate and that we’ll make\ndecisions meeting by meeting. So what are we going to be looking at? You know, we’ll be\nlooking at the incoming data, as I mentioned, and that’ll start with economic activity. Are we\nseeing the slowdown that we—the slowdown in economic activity—that we think we need? And\nthere’s some evidence that we are at this time. Of course, we’ll be looking at labor market\nPage 5 of 29\nJuly 27, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nconditions. And we’ll be asking whether we see the alignment between supply and demand\ngetting better, getting closer.\nOf course, we’ll be looking closely at inflation. You mentioned headline and core. Our\nmandate is for headline, of course; it’s not for core. But we look at core because core is, is\nactually a better indicator of headline and of all inflation going forward. So we’ll be—we’ll be\nlooking at both. And we’ll be looking at them for—at those both, really—for what they’re\nsaying about the outlook rather than just simply for, for what they say. But we’ll be asking: Do\nwe see inflationary pressures declining? Do we see actual readings of inflation coming down?\nSo, in light of all that data, the question we’ll be asking is whether the stance of policy we\nhave is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent target. And it’s also\nworth noting that these rate hikes have been large, and they’ve come—they’ve come quickly.\nAnd it’s likely that their full effect has not been felt by the economy. So there’s probably some\nadditional tightening, significant additional tightening, in the pipeline.\nSo where are we going with this? I think the best—I think the Committee broadly feels\nthat we need to get policy to at least to a moderately restrictive level. And maybe the best data\npoint for that would be what we wrote down in our SEP at the—at the June meeting. So I think\nthe median [federal funds rate] for the end of this year, the median would’ve been between 3¼\nand 3½ [percent]. And, then, people wrote down 50 basis points higher than that for 2023. So\nthat’s—even though that’s now six weeks old, I guess, that’s—that’s the most recent reading. Of\ncourse, we’ll update that reading at the—at the September meeting in eight weeks. So that’s how\nwe’re thinking about it.\nAs I mentioned, as it relates to September, I said that another unusually large increase\ncould be appropriate, but that’s not a decision we’re making now. It’s one that we’ll make based\nPage 6 of 29\nJuly 27, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\non the data we see. And we’re going to be making decisions meeting by meeting. We think\nit’s—we think it’s time to just go to a meeting-by-meeting basis and not provide, you know, the\nkind of clear guidance that we had provided on the way to neutral.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nick.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, you’ve said\nthat your policy works through influencing expectations and that policy needs to be at least\nmoderately restrictive, which means you need financial conditions to stay tight. Futures market\npricing currently implies you will raise rates this year along the lines of your June SEP but then\nlower them a few months later next year. Are these expectations consistent with the need to keep\nfinancial conditions tight in order to moderate purchasing power and bring inflation back to\n2 percent?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I’m going to start by pointing out that it’s very hard to say with\nany confidence in normal times—in normal times—what the economy’s going to be doing in\n6 or 12 months. And to try to predict what the appropriate monetary policy would respond—\nresponse would be—of course, we do that in the SEP, but, nonetheless, you’ve got to take any\nestimates of what rates will be next year with a grain of salt, because there’s so much\nuncertainty.\nThese are not normal times. There’s significantly more uncertainty now about the path\nahead than I think there ordinarily is, and, ordinarily, it’s quite high. So, again, I would—the\nbest data, the only data point I have for you really is the June SEP, which I think is just the most\nrecent thing that the Committee’s done. Since then, inflation has come in higher; economic\nactivity has come in weaker than expected.\nPage 7 of 29\nJuly 27, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nBut at the same time, I would say that’s probably the best estimate of where the\nCommittee’s thinking is still, which is that we would get to a moderately restrictive level by the\nend of this year—by which I mean somewhere between 3 and 3½ percent—and that when the\nCommittee sees further rate increases in 2023, as I mentioned, we’ll update that, of course, at the\nSeptember meeting. But that’s really the best I can do on that.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. You said inflation had been a little bit hotter than anticipated. Has\nyour view of the terminal rate changed since June?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I wouldn’t say it was—I think we didn’t expect a good reading,\nbut this one—this one was even worse than expected, I would say. I don’t talk about my own\npersonal estimate of, of what the terminal rate would be. I do—I will write down that in—it’s\ngoing to evolve. Obviously, it has evolved over the course—I think, for all participants, it has\nevolved over the course of the year as we learn how persistent inflation’s going to be.\nAnd by the time of the September meeting, we will have seen two more CPI readings and\ntwo more labor market readings and a significant amount of readings about economic activity\nand perhaps geopolitical developments, who knows. It’ll be—it’ll be a lot. It’s an eight-week\nintermeeting period, so I think we’ll see quite a lot of data. And we’ll make our decision at that\nmeeting based on that data.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jeanna.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Chair Powell. Thanks for taking our questions. Jeanna\nSmialek, New York Times. You kind of alluded to this earlier, but I wonder in the event that you\nsee several months of very weak headline inflation numbers because oil prices are coming down\nso much, but core inflation continues to be strong or even picks up, I wonder how you would\nthink about that.\nPage 8 of 29\nJuly 27, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. So it’s hard to deal with hypotheticals, but I just would say this. We,\nyou know, we would look at both, and we would ask—we’d be asking ourselves, are we\nconfident that inflation is on a path down to 2 percent? That’s really the question. And we’ll be\nmaking—you know, our policy stance will be set at a level, ultimately, at which we are confident\nthat inflation is going to be moving down to 2 percent. So you would—it would depend on a lot\nof things.\nOf course, as I mentioned, core inflation is a better predictor of inflation going forward.\nHeadline inflation tends to be volatile. So, in ordinary times, you, you look through volatile\nmoves in commodities. The problem with the current situation is that, that if you have a\nsustained period of supply shocks, those can actually start to undermine or to work—to work on\nde-anchoring inflation expectations. The public doesn’t distinguish between core and headline\ninflation in their thinking. So it’s something we have to take into consideration in our\npolicymaking even though our tools don’t really work on, on some aspects of this, which are the\nsupply-side issues.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Thanks for taking my question, Mr.\nChairman. Earlier this week, the President said, “We are not going to be in a recession.” So I\nhave two questions off of that. Do you share the President’s confidence in not being in a\nrecession? And, second, how would or would not a recession change policy? Is it a bright line,\nsir, where, where contraction of the economy would be a turning point in policy? Or is there\nsome amount of contraction of the economy the Committee would be willing to abide in its effort\nto reduce inflation?\nPage 9 of 29\nJuly 27, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. So, as I—as I mentioned, we think it’s necessary to have growth\nslow down. And growth is going to be slowing down this year for a couple of reasons, one of\nwhich is that you’re coming off of the very high growth of the reopening year of 2021. You’re\nalso seeing tighter monetary policy. And you should see some slowing.\nWe actually think we need a period of growth below potential in order to create some\nslack so that—so that the supply side can catch up. We also think that there will be, in all\nlikelihood, some softening in labor market conditions. And those are things that we expect. And\nwe think that they’re probably necessary if we were to have—to get inflation—if we were to be\nable to get inflation back down on a path to 2 percent and ultimately get there.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. The question was whether you see a recession coming and how that\nmight or might not change policy. Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. So we’re going to be—again, we’re going to be focused on getting\ninflation back down. And we—as I’ve said on other occasions, price stability is really the\nbedrock of the economy. And nothing works in the economy without price stability. We can’t\nhave a strong labor market without price stability for an extended period of time.\nWe all want to get back to the kind of labor market we had before the pandemic, where\ndifferences between, you know, racial and gender differences and that kind of thing were at\nhistoric minimums, where participation was high, where inflation was low. We want to get back\nto that, but that’s not happening. That’s not going to happen without, without restoring price\nstability. So that’s something we see as, as something that we simply must do. And we think\nthat in the—we don’t see it as a tradeoff with, with the employment mandate. We see it as a way\nto facilitate the sustained achievement of the employment mandate in the longer term.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Howard.\nPage 10 of 29\nJuly 27, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Howard Schneider with Reuters. Particularly in regard to\nexpectations, it’s been said the last few months that the risks of doing too little outweighed the\nlists—the risks of doing too much. Does that remain the bias?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we’re trying to do just the right amount, right? We’re not—we’re\nnot trying to have a recession. And we don’t think we have to. We think that there’s a path for\nus to be able to bring inflation down while sustaining a strong labor market, as I mentioned,\nalong with—in all likelihood—some, some softening in labor market conditions. So that is—\nthat’s what we’re trying to achieve, and we continue to think that there’s a path to that. We\nknow that the path has, has clearly narrowed, really based on events that are outside of our\ncontrol. And it may narrow further.\nSo, you know, I do think—as I said just now—that restoring price stability is just\nsomething that we have to do. There, there isn’t an option to fail to do that because that is the\nthing that enables you to have a strong labor market over time. Without restoring price stability,\nyou won’t be able, over the medium and longer term, to actually have a strong—a sustained\nperiod of very strong labor market conditions. So, of course, we serve both sides of the dual\nmandate, but we actually see them as well aligned on this.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. But as a—as a follow-on to that, given the uncertainty and\nthat sort of paradoxical flow of data you’ve been getting, if you’re going to make a mistake,\nwould you rather make the mistake on doing too much, raising too much, than raising too little?\nCHAIR POWELL. We’re trying not to make a mistake. Let me put it this way: We do\nsee that there are two-sided risks. There would be the risk of doing too much and, you know,\nimposing more of a downturn on the economy than, than was necessary, but the risk—the risk of\ndoing too little and leaving the economy with this entrenched inflation, it only raises the cost. If\nPage 11 of 29\nJuly 27, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nyou fail to deal with it in the near term, it only raises the cost of, of dealing with it later to the\nextent people start to see it as just part of their economic lives.\nThey start to factor high inflation into their decisions—when that—on a sustained basis.\nWhen that starts to really happen, and we don’t think that’s happened yet, but when that starts to\nhappen, it just gets that much harder. And the pain will be that much greater. So I really do\nthink that it’s important that we—that we address this now and get it done.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Neil.\nNEIL IRWIN. Thanks, Chair Powell. Neil Irwin from Axios. To build a little bit on\nwhat Steve was asking, do you believe the United States is currently in a recession? Will the\nGDP reading tomorrow affect that judgment one way or the other? And has your assessment of\nthe risk of recession changed any in recent weeks?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I don’t—I do not think the U.S. is currently in a recession. And\nthe reason is, there are just too many areas of the economy that are—that are performing, you\nknow, too well. And, of course, I would point to the labor market, in particular. As I mentioned,\nit’s true that growth is slowing for reasons that we understand. Really, the growth was\nextraordinarily high last year, 5½ percent. We would have expected growth to slow. There’s\nalso more slowing going on now.\nBut if you look at the labor market, you’ve got growth—I think, payroll jobs averaging\n450,000 per month. That’s a remarkably strong level for, for this state of, of affairs. The\nunemployment rate at near a 50-year low at 3.6 percent. All of the wage measures that we track\nare running very strong. So this is a very strong labor market, and it’s just not consistent with—\nyou know, 2.7 million people hired in the first half of the year. It doesn’t make sense that the\nPage 12 of 29\nJuly 27, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\neconomy would be in recession with, with this kind of thing happening. So I don’t think the U.S.\neconomy’s in recession right now.\nNEIL IRWIN. GDP? GDP tomorrow?\nCHAIR POWELL. Ah, haven’t seen it, and, and we’ll just have to see what it says. I\ndon’t—I mean, I would say, generally, the GDP numbers do have a tendency to be revised pretty\nsignificantly. It’s just—it’s just that it’s very hard—it’s very hard to cumulate [to an estimate of]\nU.S. GDP. It’s a large economy. And a lot of—a lot of work and judgment goes into that. But\nyou tend to take first GDP reports, I think, with a—with a grain of salt. But, of course, it’s\nsomething we’ll be looking at.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Chair Powell. Victoria Guida with Politico. I wanted to ask\nabout the new conflict-of-interest rules that you all rolled out. Some senators have written\nasking for those rules to have more teeth and to have sort of more transparency about Fed’s\nfinancial—the Fed officials’ financial activity. I was wondering if you could speak to that and\nwhether you intend on, you know, toughening those rules in any way.\nCHAIR POWELL. So those are—those are the toughest rules in place, you know, at any\ncomparable institution that I’m aware of. We think—you know, we’ve thought about this\ncarefully, and we put them in place. And we’re building the infrastructure so that—so that, you\nknow, the enforcement will be tight, that, actually, you won’t be able to make trades unless\nthey’re precleared. And the amount of trades you make, they’ll have to be 45 days or more\nbefore any FOMC meeting. It’s just—I think we’ve really, you know, created a very strong and\nrobust set of rules that will, you know, support public trust in the institution. And, again, we’re\njust now—the system is just now up and running. And I’m proud of what we did.\nPage 13 of 29\nJuly 27, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMICHELLE SMITH. Catarina.\nCATARINA SARAIVA. Hi, Chair Powell. Hi. Catarina Saraiva, Bloomberg News. I\nwanted to ask a little bit more about the 75 basis points versus 50 versus 25. Can you talk a little\nbit about what, what kind of goes into your thinking for, you know, making the decision on how\nmuch to raise rates and, you know, just talking about a very large amount that you alluded to?\nCould that possibly be 100 basis points? And then, kind of along those lines, is there any sort of\nweakness in the economy, outside of inflation measures, that would lead you to slow your\nhiking pace?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I’m going to—I’m going to take that as a question about the next\nmeeting and thereafter. So, as I mentioned, we’re going to be looking at all of those things:\nactivity, labor market, inflation. And we’re going to be thinking about our policy stance and\nwhere does it really need to be. And I also mentioned that, as this process—now that we’re at\nneutral—as the process goes on, at some point, it will be appropriate to, to slow down. And we\nhaven’t made a decision when that point is, but intuitively that makes sense, right? We’ve been\nfront-end-loading these very large rate increases, and now we’re getting closer to where we need\nto be. So that’s how we’re thinking about it.\nAnd in terms of September, we’re going—we’re going to watch the data and the evolving\noutlook very carefully and factor in everything and make a decision in September about what to\ndo. And I’m not really going to provide any specific guidance about what that might be. So, you\nknow, but I mentioned that we might do another unusually large rate increase. But that’s not a\ndecision that we’ve made at all.\nSo we are—you know, we’re going to be guided by the data. And I think you can still\nthink of the, the destination as broadly in line with the September—sorry, the June SEP, because\nPage 14 of 29\nJuly 27, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nit’s only six weeks old. And sometimes, sometimes SEPs can get old really quick. I think in this\none—this one I would say is probably, probably the best guide we have as to where the\nCommittee thinks it needs to get at the end of the year and then into next year. So I would point\nyou to that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Chris.\nCHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Hi. Thank you. Chris Rugaber, Associated Press. I\nwanted to ask about right now, there’s a sort of growing gap between the Fed’s preferred\nmeasure of inflation, the PCE, PCE index, and the one that’s followed by the public, the CPI, of\ncourse. How do you expect to handle this divergence if the PCE starts to come down enough for\nyou to consider slowing rate hikes, even if the public is still seeing much higher CPI ratings?\nThank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So it’s an interesting, interesting situation. Of course, we’ve, we’ve\nlong used PCE because we think it’s just better at capturing the inflation that people actually face\nin their lives. And I think that that view is pretty widely understood. That said, the public really\nreads about CPI. And the difference really is because the CPI has higher weights on things like\nfood, gasoline, motor vehicles, and housing than the PCE index does. And so that accounts for a\nlot of the difference. However, over time, they tend to come together.\nYou know, we—given the importance in the public eye of CPI, we are calling it out and\nnoticing it and everything like that. But remember, we do target PCE. That is because we think\nit’s a better measure. They will come together eventually. The typical gap was really about\n25 basis points for a very long time. And if it went—if it got to 40 basis points, that would be\nvery noticeable. And now it’s—now it’s much larger than that because of the things I\nPage 15 of 29\nJuly 27, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nmentioned. So we’ll be watching both, but, again, the one that we think is the best measure\nalways has been PCE, at least since I think we—some 20 plus years ago—moved to PCE.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Michael McKee.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. I’d like to weave a couple of things together, Mr. Chairman.\nMichael McKee from Bloomberg TV and Radio. You said that the destination pretty much\nremains the same in terms of your end-of-the-year target. But where are you in the journey?\nWe’ve now seen the federal stimulus programs end. You mentioned consumer spending,\nbusiness investment have slowed. Are they moving at a pace you would expect? Or is demand\nstill greater than supply—too much greater than supply that you need to do significantly more?\nAnd I ask because there are lags in the impact of monetary policy, as you mentioned. And a lot\nof this might hit in 2023. The strong dollar effect may hit in 2023, when the economy might be\nweak. How, how do you know where you are and where you think you need to get to?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, just talking about demand for a second: As I mentioned in my\nremarks, I think you pretty clearly do see a slowing now in demand in the second quarter—\nconsumer spending, business fixed investment, housing, places like that. I think, you know,\npeople widely looked at the first-quarter numbers and thought they didn’t make sense and might\nhave been misleading in terms of the overall direction of the economy—[that was] not, not true\nof the second quarter. But at the same time, you have this labor market.\nSo there are plenty of experiences where GDP has been reported as weak and the labor\nmarket as strong. And the economy has gone right through that and been fine. So that—that’s\nhappened many times. And it used to happen—if you remember, in the first quarter of every\nyear, for several years in a row, GDP was negative, and the labor market was moving on just\nPage 16 of 29\nJuly 27, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nfine. And it turned out to just be measurement error. It was called residual seasonality. We\ndon’t know the situation.\nThe truth is, though, we, we think that demand is moderating. We do. How much is it\nmoderating? We’re not sure. We’re going to have to watch the data carefully. There are—there\nis a great deal of money on people’s balance sheets that they can spend. The unemployment rate\nis very low. The labor market’s very hot. There are many, many job openings. Wages are high.\nSo it’s the kind of thing where you think that the—that the economy should actually be, be doing\npretty well in the second half of the year. But we’ll have to see. We don’t know that because\nyou do see a marked slowing in the second quarter that does—that is fairly broad. So we’ll be\nwatching that. We’ll be watching that. Of course, as I mentioned, we do want to see demand\nrunning below potential for a sustained period to create slack and, and give inflation a chance to\ncome down.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nicole.\nNICOLE GOODKIND. Hi, thank you, Chairman. Nicole Goodkind, CNN Business.\nWhen does the Committee expect to see a meaningful slowdown in the labor market? And how\nmuch weakness will it accept with regard to slower job growth and higher unemployment before\nit pauses or begins to think about cutting rates?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think you’re already seeing—you’ve seen, in the labor market,\nwhat you’ve seen is a decline from very high levels of job creation last year and earlier this year\nto modestly slower job creation—still, still quite robust, as I mentioned. So you’re seeing that.\nYou’re seeing some increase—some increase in initial claims from insurance, although that may\nactually have to do with seasonal adjustments. We’re not sure that that’s actually real.\nPage 17 of 29\nJuly 27, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nThere’s some evidence that wages—if you look at average hourly earnings, they appear\nto be moderating, not so yet from the other wage measures. And we’ll be getting the\nemployment compensation index measurement, I think, on Friday, I guess. And that’s a very\nimportant one because it adjusts for compensation—composition.\nSo I’d say you—and also, anecdotally, you hear much—the sort of level of concern on\nthe part of businesses that they simply can’t find workers is probably down a little bit from what\nit was, say, for example, late in the latter parts of last year. So there’s a feeling that the labor\nmarket is moving back into balance. If you look at—if you look at job openings or quits, you see\nthem moving sideways or perhaps a little bit down. But it’s only the beginning of an adjustment.\nBut I think most—also, if you look at—I mean, once you start citing these things, you\ncan’t stop. If you look at the household survey, you see much lower job creation, and the\nhousehold survey can be quite volatile, but it has no jobs created in the last three months. So that\nmight be a signal that job creation’s actually a little bit slower than we’re seeing in the—in the\nestablishment survey. So executive summary [is]: I would say there’s some evidence that labor\ndemand may be slowing a bit—labor supply, not so much. We have been disappointed that labor\nforce participation really hasn’t moved up since January. That may be related to yet another big\nwave of COVID. And there’s evidence that that’s the case. But—So we’re not seeing much in\nthe way of labor supply. Nonetheless, I would say some, some progress on demand and supply\ngetting back in alignment.\nNICOLE GOODKIND. And then how much weakness would you be willing to accept\nbefore you think about pausing rate cuts?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think we’re looking—we’re going to be looking at, at inflation\nas well. You know, as I mentioned, we need to see inflation coming down. We need to be\nPage 18 of 29\nJuly 27, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nconfident that inflation is going to get back down to mandate-consistent levels. That’s not\nsomething we can avoid doing. That really needs to happen.\nAnd, but we do think, though, that the labor market can adjust because of the huge\noverhang of job openings, of excess demand, really. There should be able to be an adjustment\nthat would have lower than—perhaps lower-than-expected increases in unemployment—lower\nthan would be expected in the ordinary course of events because the level—the ratio of, of\nvacancies to unemployed is just out of keeping with historical experience. And that suggests that\nthis time could be different.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Edward Lawrence.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Edward Lawrence from Fox\nBusiness. So you said that the path may be narrowed to avoiding a recession. So how, how\nclose are we to a recession? And then how do forecasts of possible recession from banks and\neconomists, how does that make a soft landing you’ve talked about more difficult?\nCHAIR POWELL. So as, as I mentioned, it doesn’t seem that the U.S. economy is in\nrecession right now. And I think you do see weakening, some slowdown—let’s put it that way—\nin growth. And you see it across some of the categories that I mentioned. But there’s also just\nthe very strong data coming out of the labor market, still. So, overall, you would say that, in all\nprobability, demand is still strong, and, and the economy is still on track to continue to grow this\nyear. But the slowdown in the second quarter is notable. And we’re—you know, we’re going to\nbe watching that carefully. Sorry, what was the—\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Forecasts. You know, how do bank forecasts of possible\nrecessions, economists, does that affect the soft landing?\nPage 19 of 29\nJuly 27, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, you know, we’ve said since the beginning, I think, that, that\nhaving a soft landing is what we’re aiming for. Of course, that has to be our goal. It is our goal.\nAnd we’ll keep trying to achieve it. I think—I do think events—at the beginning, we said it was\nnot going to be easy. It was going to be quite challenging to do that. It’s unusual. It’s an\nunusual event. It’s not a typical event, given where we are.\nIf there is a path to it, and we think there is, it is the one I mentioned, that the labor\nmarket actually is—has such a large amount of surplus demand that you could see—you could\nsee that demand coming down in a way that didn’t translate into a big increase in unemployment\nas you would expect in the ordinary course because, frankly, the imbalance is so much greater.\nAnd, but we don’t know that. I mean, this is a—this is a case of first impression. So anyone\nwho is really sure that it’s impossible or really sure that it will happen is probably\nunderestimating the level of uncertainty. And so I would certainly say it’s an uncertain,\nuncertain thing. Nonetheless, it’s our goal to achieve it, and we’ll keep trying to do that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jean.\nJEAN YUNG. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Jean Yung with Market News. I wanted to\nask about the balance sheet reduction program. It’s been working for a couple months now and\nin a different environment than the last time the Fed did it. What are you learning about how it’s\nworking and how markets are reacting? And is reaching the minimum level of reserves needed\nin the system still several years away at the current pace?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we think it’s working fine. As you know, we, we tapered up into\nit. And, and in September, we’ll go to full strength. And the markets seem to have accepted it.\nBy all assessments, the markets should be able to absorb this. And we expect that’ll be the case.\nPage 20 of 29\nJuly 27, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nSo I would say the plan is broadly on track. It’s a little bit slow to get going because some of\nthese trades don’t settle until—for a bit of time. But it’ll be picking up steam.\nSo I guess your second question was getting—the process of getting back down to the\nnew equilibrium will take a while. And that time, it’s hard to be precise, but, you know, the\nmodel would suggest that it could be between two, two and a half years, that kind of thing. And\nthis is a much faster pace than the last time. Balance sheet’s much, much bigger than it was. But\nwe looked at this carefully, and we thought that this, this was the sensible pace. And we have no\nreason to think it’s not.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Brian.\nBRIAN CHEUNG. Hi, Chairman Powell. Brian Cheung, Yahoo Finance. Looking at\nfinancial conditions, it seems like the tightening has slowed as of late with the 10 year coming\ndown, 30-year fixed mortgage rates also going a bit sideways, when we talk about a hot housing\nmarket still. Just wondering if you find financial conditions tight enough, especially as you\ncontinue to raise rates.\nCHAIR POWELL. So a big piece of that is inflation expectations—you know,\nbreakevens coming down, which, you know, is a good thing. It’s a good thing that markets do\nseem to have confidence in, in the Committee’s commitment to getting inflation back down to\n2 percent. So we like to see market-based, you know, readings of inflation expectations come\ndown. You know, broader financial conditions have tightened, tightened a good bit. I mean, the\nway this works is we, we set our policy, and financial conditions react, and then financial\nconditions are what affects the economy.\nAnd we don’t control that second step. We’re just going to do what we think needs to be\ndone. We’re going to—we’re going to get our policy rate to a level where we’re confident that\nPage 21 of 29\nJuly 27, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ninflation will be moving back down to 2 percent. Confident. So that’s how we’re going to take\nit. And, of course, we’ll be watching financial conditions to see that they are appropriately tight\nand that they’re having the effect that we would hope they’re having, which is to see demand\nmoderate and inflationary pressures recede and, ultimately, inflation come down.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Greg.\nGREG ROBB. Thank you, Chair Powell. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. I wonder if\nyou can go back a little bit in time to before there was this outbreak of inflation, when the\nCommittee put in place forward guidance on tapering asset purchases. I think it was December\n2020. There’s a recent speech by Fed Governor Waller talking about that and saying that maybe\nthat was too tight, that kind of condition, and it put you a little bit behind—not his words but\nmaybe, you know, were kind of late to react to some of that inflation. So could you talk about\nthat decision, and have you looked at it in hindsight at all? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So, yes, we said that we wouldn’t lift off until we had basically\nachieved our dual-mandate goals. And the reason we did it in real time was that, the first look at\nthe new framework that we’d rolled out, plenty of people were saying, “It’s not credible. You’ll\nnever get inflation to 2 percent.” Some of our critics now who say inflation’s too tight—too high\nwere the same ones who were saying, “You’ll never get to 2 percent.” Well, but anyway, that’s\nwhat happened.\nSo we, we thought we needed to really make a strong statement with that. It wasn’t part\nof the framework. The December ’20 guidance was not part of our overall new framework. It\nwas just guidance that we put in place. So I would say two things. One, I don’t think that that\nhas materially changed the situation. But I have to admit, I don’t think I would do that again. I\ndon’t think I would do that again. We—you know, ultimately, the situation evolved in a highly\nPage 22 of 29\nJuly 27, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nunexpected way for all of us. And, you know, maybe the learning is that leave a little more\nflexibility than that.\nBut did it matter in the end? You know, we—if you look at—I really don’t think it did.\nI’m not sure it would’ve mattered if we’d been raising rates three months earlier. Does anybody\nthink that would’ve made a big difference? I mean, lots of central banks were raising rates three\nmonths earlier, and it didn’t matter. I mean, this is a—this is a global phenomenon that’s\nhappening now—admittedly, different in the United States, but anyway.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nancy.\nGREG ROBB. Can I follow up?\nMICHELLE SMITH. Sorry about that, Greg.\nGREG ROBB. Just a lot of people talk about that time, and they talk about a taper\ntantrum. I know you haven’t talked about it too much but that you were worried at the time\nabout repeating that taper tantrum that you had experienced as a Governor. So was that part of\nthat? Where did that fit into all those decisions? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think we learned—there’ve been multiple taper tantrums, right?\nSo there was the famous one in 2013. There’s what happened at the December ’18 meeting,\nwhere, you know, markets can ignore developments around the balance sheet for years on end\nand then suddenly react very sharply. So we just had developed a practice of moving predictably\nand doing it in steps and things like that. It was just like that’s how we did it. And so we did it\nthat way this time. We were—we were careful to, to take steps and communicate and all that\nkind of thing. Yes, we were trying to avoid a tantrum because they can be quite destructive.\nThey can tighten financial conditions and knock the economy off kilter. And, you know, when it\nhappens, you have to—really, in both ’13 and ’18, it really had consequences for the real\nPage 23 of 29\nJuly 27, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\neconomy, you know, two, three, four months later. So we were trying to avoid that. That was\npart of it.\nAgain, I don’t think that’s—the real issue of 2020 and ’21 was just trying to understand\nwhat was happening with the reopening economy. That, that was where the big uncertainty was.\nAnd, you know, our view was that these supply-side issues would get better: that people would\ngo back to work, that labor force participation would come back, everyone would get vaccinated,\nschools would open, kids would be in school, and labor force participation would jump back up.\nThat’s what we were—that was very broadly thought to be the case: these supply-side issues\nwould get solved reasonably quickly. And they just haven’t. They still haven’t.\nSo that’s really the learning, I think, is around how complicated these supply-side issues\ncan be. We haven’t seen this before in a long, long time. And so that’s really, you know, what\naccounts for the pace at which we moved, and we did. When inflation changed direction, really,\nin October, we’ve moved quickly since then. I think people would agree. But before then,\ninflation was coming down month by month. And, you know, we kind of thought we had the\nstory—probably had the story right. But then, I think in October, you started to see a range of\ndata that said “No. This is a much stronger economy and much higher inflation than we’ve been\nthinking.” And, again, we’ve pivoted, and here we are.\nGREG ROBB. Thanks.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nancy.\nNANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace. Chair\nPowell, I just want to pin you down a little bit more on the issue of recession. So if we get a\nnegative GDP number tomorrow for the second quarter, would the Fed consider the U.S. in a\nrecession? And just remind us, what is your definition for the start of a recession?\nPage 24 of 29\nJuly 27, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. So the Fed doesn’t make a—doesn’t make a judgment on that. You\nknow, we’re focused on the dual mandate and using our tools to achieve maximum employment\nand price stability. We don’t—we don’t say “There is now a recession” and that kind of thing.\nSo that wouldn’t be something we’d do. We would look at the data tomorrow—and no doubt,\nwe’ll look at it very carefully—and draw whatever implications we can.\nAs I mentioned, though, you know, if you think about what an inflation—sorry, what a\nrecession really is, it’s a broad-based decline across many industries that, you know, is sustained\nfor more than a couple of months, and there are a bunch of specific tests in it. And it just\ndoesn’t—this just doesn’t seem like that now. What we have right now doesn’t seem like that.\nAnd the real reason is that the labor market is just sending such a signal of economic strength\nthat it makes you really question the GDP data. But, again, that’s not a decision that we—that\nwe make. And we won’t—we won’t reach a conclusion one way or another on that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Simon.\nSIMON RABINOVITCH. Thank you very much. Simon Rabinovitch with the\nEconomist. You said that some softening in the labor market is needed. Within the Fed, there\nare staff economists who’ve argued that NAIRU, the noninflationary rate of unemployment,\nmight be as high as 5 to 6 percent right now, which obviously is a lot higher than the current rate\nof 3.6. What’s your assessment of NAIRU? Is that something that came up in discussion with\nthe Committee?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think, broadly, a lot of economists think that the—that the\nnatural rate of unemployment will have moved up to some significant extent above where we\nthink it was before. And the reason is there’s—it’s the usual matching issue, where matching has\nbecome less effective, and that kind of thing when you have the kind of turbulent downturn and\nPage 25 of 29\nJuly 27, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthe big switches in demand from services to goods and all that. So it could be higher. And my\nown instinct is that the natural rate of unemployment is higher. Of course, I would add that we\ndon’t know it. We can never know where these star variables are in real time with any\nconfidence. But I would say it must have moved up materially.\nBut the other side of that is, as all these jobs get created and people go back to work and\nunemployment is so low, I think you could, in principle, you could see it coming back down\npretty significantly. And that would also, by the way, take pressure off of inflation because it’s\nthat gap—it’s the gap between actual unemployment and the—and the natural rate that really is\nrelevant for, you know, the negative slack we have in the economy with the overtight labor\nmarket. So if you were to—you wouldn’t observe this. It’s an unobservable, but you could\nactually be seeing inflationary pressures coming down if that does happen. And we don’t—we\ndon’t control that. But that’s something that, logically, if the pandemic and the disorder in the\nlabor market caused the natural rate to move up, then as the labor market settles down, in\nprinciple, you should see it move back down.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jeff.\nJEFF COX. Thank you, Chair Powell. Jeff Cox from CNBC.com. Just a question\nabout—hate to keep banging the drum about recession. But most of the polls that we’re seeing\nnow from the public, people believe that we’re already in a recession or heading for one—\neconomists, pretty much the same thing. They’re being told by folks like you and the\nAdministration that we’re not in a recession, we’re not heading for a recession—frankly, coming\nfrom the same people who told them inflation was transitory, telling them now that we’re not\nheading for a recession. So what would you tell the public to reassure them now that you feel\nPage 26 of 29\nJuly 27, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nconfident in your forecast going forward and the Fed is ready to respond to a—to a potential\ndownturn in the economy?\nCHAIR POWELL. No, all I’ve really said is I don’t think it’s likely that the U.S.\neconomy’s in a recession now. And I’ve explained why that is the case. It’s, it’s because you do\nsee a very strong labor market. And I think the public will see that as well. You know, going\nforward, what we’ve seen is a—is a slowing in spending, as I mentioned. We’ve seen the very\nbeginnings of perhaps a slight lessening in the—in the tightness of the labor market, but it would\nonly be the beginnings.\nSo, and I mentioned that, that—I also said that our goal is to bring inflation down and\nhave a so-called soft landing, by which I mean a landing that doesn’t require a significant\nincrease, a really significant increase in unemployment. We’re trying to achieve that. I have\nsaid, on many occasions, that we understand that’s going to be quite challenging and that it’s got\nmore challenging over recent months.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Kyle.\nKYLE CAMPBELL. Thanks, Chair Powell. Kyle Campbell with American Banker.\nThe FOMC has historically tried to avoid the kind of rapid monetary policy tightening that has\nhappened so far this year. How concerned are you that the rate hikes that we’ve seen thus far\nmight increase risks to financial stability not just domestically, but globally?\nCHAIR POWELL. I mean, there are precedents for the FOMC moving very quickly—\nfor example, in 1994, and in 1980, even more so. So we’ve been known to do that when it’s the\nappropriate thing to do. And this year, it clearly is. I would say that, given how quickly we’ve\nmoved, I’m gratified that while—that, basically, markets have been working. They’ve been\norderly. There’s been some volatility, but that’s only to be expected.\nPage 27 of 29\nJuly 27, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nFor a financial stability perspective, you know, asset values are down, which in some—in\nsome sense lowers vulnerabilities. It’s when they’re really high that you would worry that\nthey’re—that they’re vulnerable to a fall, actually. Many asset values have come down. I think\nyou’ve got a well-capitalized banking system. I think you have—households are generally in\nabout as strong as financial shape as they’ve been in a very long time or perhaps ever given the\nmoney that’s on people’s balance sheets. So you have a pretty—from a financial stability\nstandpoint, you have a pretty decent picture.\nNow, the macroeconomic, there are plenty of macroeconomic issues that don’t rise to the\nlevel of financial stability concerns. By financial stability, you know, we think of that as things\nthat might undermine the working of the financial system, so big, serious things. That’s not to\nsay that people at the lower end of the income spectrum aren’t, aren’t suffering, because they are.\nThey’re suffering from high inflation. They’re going to the—to the grocery store and finding\nthat, in many cases, their paycheck doesn’t cover the food they’re accustomed to buying. We’re\nseeing actual, you know, real declines in food consumption. And, you know, it’s very\nconcerning. It’s very unfortunate. And that’s why we’re—we’re really committed to bringing\ndown inflation—one of the reasons.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Mark for the last question.\nMARK HAMRICK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mark Hamrick with Bankrate. I can\nremember when you held your first news conference, and you vowed to be a very plainspoken\nChairman, and we’re thinking today about the impacts of Fed policy on individuals as well.\nWhat would you say to individuals or households who may yet lose their jobs in this tightening\ncycle in the fight against inflation as they try to translate what Fed policy means to them in this\ncomplicated economic landscape? Thank you.\nPage 28 of 29\nJuly 27, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. So I guess the first thing I would say to, to every household is that\nwe know that inflation is too high. We understand how painful it is, particularly for people who\nare living paycheck to paycheck and spend most of that paycheck on necessities, such as food\nand gas and heating their homes and clothing and things like that. We do understand that, that\nthose people suffer the most. Middle-class and better-off people have some resources, where\nthey can absorb these things. But people, many people, don’t have those resources. So, you\nknow, we—it is our job. It is our institutional role. We are assigned uniquely and\nunconditionally the obligation of, of providing price stability to the American people. And we’re\ngoing to use our tools to do that.\nAs I mentioned, there will be some, in all likelihood, some softening in labor market\nconditions. We need growth to slow to below potential growth. We don’t want to—we don’t\nwant this to be bigger than it needs to be. But, ultimately, if you think about the medium and\nlonger term, price stability is the thing that, that makes the whole economy work. It’s what\ncan—it can give us a strong labor market and wages that aren’t being eaten up by high inflation.\nIf you talk to people—again, people who are making, you know, wages, relatively low wages—\nthey’re the ones who are suffering the most from inflation. So it’s all the more reason why we\nneed to move, move on this. Thank you very much.\nPage 29 of 29"

My colleagues and I are strongly committed to\nbringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal. We have both the tools we need and the\nresolve that it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses.\nPrice stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our\neconomy. Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without\nprice stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that\nbenefit all.\nToday the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by ¾ percentage point, and we anticipate\nthat ongoing increases will be appropriate. We are moving our policy stance purposefully to a\nlevel that will be sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent. In addition, we are\ncontinuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet. I will have more to\nsay about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments.\nThe U.S. economy has slowed from the historically high growth rates of 2021, which\nreflected the reopening of the economy following the pandemic recession. Recent indicators\npoint to modest growth of spending and production. Growth in consumer spending has slowed\nfrom last year’s rapid pace, in part reflecting lower real disposable income and tighter financial\nconditions. Activity in the housing sector has weakened significantly, in large part reflecting\nhigher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be\nweighing on business fixed investment, while weaker economic growth abroad is restraining\nexports. As shown in our Summary of Economic Projections, since June, FOMC participants\nhave marked down their projections for economic activity, with the median projection for real\nPage 1 of 21\nSeptember 21, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nGDP growth standing at just 0.2 percent this year and 1.2 percent next year, well below the\nmedian estimate of the longer-run normal growth rate.\nDespite the slowdown in growth, the labor market has remained extremely tight, with the\nunemployment rate near a 50-year low, job vacancies near historical highs, and wage growth\nelevated. Job gains have been robust, with employment rising by an average of 378,000 jobs per\nmonth over the last three months. The labor market continues to be out of balance, with demand\nfor workers substantially exceeding the supply of available workers. The labor force\nparticipation rate showed a welcome uptick in August but is little changed since the beginning of\nthe year. FOMC participants expect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come\ninto better balance over time, easing the upward pressure on wages and prices. The median\nprojection in the SEP for the unemployment rate rises to 4.4 percent at the end of next year,\n½ percentage point higher than in the June projections. Over the next three years, the median\nunemployment rate runs above the median estimate of its longer-run normal level.\nInflation remains well above our 2 percent longer-run goal. Over the 12 months ending\nin July, total PCE prices rose 6.3 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core\nPCE prices rose 4.6 percent. In August, the 12-month change in the consumer price index was\n8.3 percent, and the change in the core CPI was 6.3 percent. Price pressures remain evident\nacross a broad range of goods and services. Although gasoline prices have turned down in recent\nmonths, they remain well above year-earlier levels, in part reflecting Russia’s war against\nUkraine, which has boosted prices for energy and food and has created additional upward\npressure on inflation. The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 5.4 percent this\nyear and falls to 2.8 percent next year, 2.3 percent in 2024, and 2 percent in 2025. Participants\ncontinue to see risks to inflation as weighted to the upside.\nPage 2 of 21\nSeptember 21, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nDespite elevated inflation, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well\nanchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters as\nwell as measures from financial markets. But that is not grounds for complacency; the longer the\ncurrent bout of high inflation continues, the greater the chance that expectations of higher\ninflation will become entrenched.\nThe Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware\nthat high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for\nthose least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We\nare highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are\nstrongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.\nAt today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by\n¾ percentage point, bringing the target range to 3 to 3¼ percent. And we are continuing the\nprocess of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet, which plays an important role in\nfirming the stance of monetary policy.\nOver coming months, we will be looking for compelling evidence that inflation is moving\ndown consistent with inflation returning to 2 percent. We anticipate that ongoing increases in the\ntarget range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate; the pace of those increases will\ncontinue to depend on the incoming data and the evolving outlook for the economy. With\ntoday’s action, we have raised interest rates by 3 percentage points this year. At some point, as\nthe stance of monetary policy tightens further, it will become appropriate to slow the pace of\nincreases while we assess how our cumulative policy adjustments are affecting the economy and\nPage 3 of 21\nSeptember 21, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ninflation. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting and communicate our\nthinking as clearly as possible.\nRestoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive policy stance for\nsome time. The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy. As\nshown in the SEP, the median projection for the appropriate level of the federal funds rate is\n4.4 percent at the end of this year, 1 percentage point higher than projected in June. The median\nprojection rises to 4.6 percent at the end of next year and declines to 2.9 percent by the end of\n2025, still above the median estimate of its longer-run value. Of course, these projections do not\nrepresent a Committee decision or plan, and no one knows with any certainty where the economy\nwill be a year or more from now.\nWe are taking forceful and rapid steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better\nalignment with supply. Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to\nour 2 percent goal and to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Reducing\ninflation is likely to require a sustained period of below-trend growth, and there will very likely\nbe some softening of labor market conditions. Restoring price stability is essential to set the\nstage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. We will keep\nat it until we are confident the job is done.\nTo conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and\nbusinesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the\nFed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.\nThank you, and I look forward to your questions.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you for taking our questions. Jeanna\nSmialek from the New York Times. I wonder if you could give us a little detail around how\nPage 4 of 21\nSeptember 21, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nyou’ll know when to slow down these rate increases and how you’ll eventually know when\nto stop.\nCHAIR POWELL. So I will answer—I will answer your question directly, but I want to\nstart here today by saying that my main message has not changed at all since Jackson Hole. The\nFOMC is strongly resolved to bring inflation down to 2 percent, and we will keep at it until the\njob is done. So the way we’re thinking about this is, the overarching focus of the Committee is\ngetting inflation back down to 2 percent. To accomplish that, we think we’ll need to do two\nthings, in particular: to achieve a period of growth below trend; and also some softening in labor\nmarket conditions to foster a better balance between demand and supply in the labor market.\nSo on the first, the Committee’s forecasts and those of most outside forecasters do show\ngrowth running below its longer-run potential this year and next year. On the second, though, so\nfar there’s only modest evidence that the labor market is cooling off. Job openings are down a\nbit, as you know; quits are off their all-time highs; there’s some signs that some wage measures\nmay be flattening out but not moving up; payroll gains have moderated but not much. And in\nlight of the high inflation we’re seeing, we think we’ll need to—and in light of what I just said,\nwe think that we’ll need to bring our funds rate to a restrictive level and to keep it there for\nsome time.\nSo, what will we be looking at, I guess, is your question. So we’ll be looking at a few\nthings. First, we’ll want to see growth continuing to run below trend, we’ll want to see\nmovements in the labor market showing a return to a better balance between supply and demand,\nand, ultimately, we’ll want to see clear evidence that inflation is moving back down to 2 percent.\nSo that’s what we’ll be looking for. In terms of reducing rates, I think we’d want to be very\nconfident that inflation is moving back down to 2 percent before we would consider that.\nPage 5 of 21\nSeptember 21, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Can you talk\nabout how you factor in the variable lags on inflation and the extent to which the outlook for\nrates should be seen as linear in the sense that you keep raising rates? Well, can you envision a\ntime when there’s a pause to kind of look at what has been wrought in the economy from the rate\nincreases? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So, of course, monetary policy does, famously, work with long\nand variable lags. The way I think of it is, our policy decisions affect financial conditions\nimmediately. In fact, financial conditions have usually been affected well before we actually\nannounce our decisions. Then, changes in financial conditions begin to affect economic activity\nfairly quickly, within a few months. But it’s likely to take some time to see the full effects of\nchanging financial conditions on inflation. So we are very much mindful for that. And that’s\nwhy I noted in my opening remarks that, at some point, as the stance of policy tightens further, it\nwill become appropriate to slow the pace of rate hikes while we assess how our cumulative\npolicy adjustments are affecting the economy and inflation. So that’s how we think about that.\nYour second question—sorry—was?\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Is there a point in time you could see pausing? Is it linear? Do you\nkeep raising rates, or is there—oh, sorry, I should know better than to not talk with a\nmicrophone.\nCHAIR POWELL. I should know better than to answer your second question.\n[Laughter]\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Well, there you go. Is it linear? Do you keep raising rates, or is\nthere a pause that you could envision where you kind of figure out what has happened to the\nPage 6 of 21\nSeptember 21, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\neconomy and give time to catch up in the real economy—the rate increase time to catch up in the\nreal economy? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think it’s very hard to say with precise certainty the way this is\ngoing to unfold. As I mentioned, what we think we need to do and should do is to move our\npolicy rate to a restrictive level that’s restrictive enough to bring inflation down to 2 percent,\nwhere we have confidence of that. And what you see in the SEP numbers is people’s views as of\ntoday, as of this meeting, as to the kind of levels that will be appropriate.\nNow, those will evolve over time, and I think we’ll just have to see how that goes. There\nis a possibility, certainly, that we would go to a certain level that we’re confident in and stay\nthere for a time. But we’re not at that level. Clearly, today we’re, we’ve just moved, I think,\nprobably, into the very lowest level of what might be restrictive, and, certainly, in my view and\nthe view of the Committee, there’s a ways to go.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Okay. Rachel.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Hi, Chair Powell. Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. Thank\nyou for taking our questions. The projections show the unemployment rate rising to 4.4 percent\nnext year, and, historically, that kind of rise in the unemployment rate would typically bring a\nrecession with it. Should we interpret that to mean no soft landing, and is that kind of rise\nnecessary to get inflation down?\nCHAIR POWELL. Right. So you’re right—in the SEP, there’s what I would\ncharacterize as a relatively modest increase in the unemployment rate from a historical\nperspective, given the expected decline in inflation. Now, why is that? So, really, that is what\nwe generally expect because we see the current situation as outside of historical experience in a\nnumber of ways, and I’ll mention a couple of those. First—and you know these—but first, job\nPage 7 of 21\nSeptember 21, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nopenings are incredibly high relative to the number of people looking for work. It’s plausible,\nI’ll say, that job openings could come down significantly—and they need to—without as much\nof an increase in unemployment as has happened in earlier historical episodes. So that’s one\nthing.\nIn addition, in this cycle, longer-run inflation expectations have generally been fairly well\nanchored, and, as I’ve said, there’s no basis for complacency there. But to the extent that\ncontinues to be the case, that should make it easier to restore price stability. And I guess the\nthird thing I would point to that’s different this time is that part of this inflation is caused by this\nseries of supply shocks that we’ve had, beginning with the pandemic, and, really, with the\nreopening of the economy, and more recently amplified and added to by Russia’s invasion of\nUkraine—have all contributed to the sharp increase in inflation.\nSo these are the kinds of events that are not really seen in prior business cycles, and, in\nprinciple, if those things start to get better—and we do see some evidence of the beginnings of\nthat. It’s not much more than that, but it’s good to see that. For example, commodity prices look\nlike they may have peaked for now; supply chain disruptions are beginning to resolve. Those\ndevelopments, if sustained, could help ease the pressures on inflation.\nSo let me just say, how much these factors will turn out to really matter in this sequence\nof events—it remains to be seen. We have always understood that restoring price stability while\nachieving a relatively modest decline—or, rather, increase—in unemployment and a soft landing\nwould be very challenging. And we don’t know—no one knows whether this process will lead\nto a recession or, if so, how significant that recession would be. That’s going to depend on how\nquickly wage and price inflation pressures come down, whether expectations remain anchored,\nand whether, also, do we get more labor supply, which would help as well.\nPage 8 of 21\nSeptember 21, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nIn addition, the chances of a soft landing are likely to diminish to the extent that policy\nneeds to be more restrictive or restrictive for longer. Nonetheless, we’re committed to getting\ninflation back down to 2 percent—because we think that a failure to restore price stability would\nmean far greater pain later on.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Just to follow up on one small thing—are vacancies still at the top of\nyour list in terms of understanding the labor market and how much room there is there?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes, vacancies are still almost a 2-to-1 ratio to unemployed people.\nThat and quits are really very good ways to look at how tight the labor market is and how\ndifferent it is from other cycles, where, generally, the unemployment rate itself is the single best\nindicator. We think those things have, for quite a time now, really added value in terms of\nunderstanding where the labor market is.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nick.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. You said not too long\nago, in describing the policy destination, there’s still a way to go. But I imagine you have to\nhave some idea about how you’re thinking about your destination, whether it’s a stopping point\nor a pausing point. And so I was wondering if you could discuss how you are thinking about, as\nthe data come in, where that destination is, how it’s moving up. If inflation doesn’t perform as\nyou expect, do you want to have a policy rate that’s above the underlying inflation rate, for\nexample, and do you have an estimate for where you think the underlying inflation rate might be\nin the economy right now?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, so, again, we believe that we need to raise our policy stance\noverall to a level that is restrictive—and by that I mean, is meaningfully, putting meaningful\ndownward pressure on inflation. That’s what we need to see in the stance of policy. We also\nPage 9 of 21\nSeptember 21, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nknow that there are long and variable lags, particularly as they relate to inflation. So it’s a\nchallenging assessment. So, what do you look at? You look at broader financial conditions, as\nyou know; you look at where rates are, real and nominal in some cases; you look at credit\nspreads; you look at financial conditions indexes.\nWe also, I would think—and you see this in the—this is something we talked about today\nin the meeting and talk about in all of our meetings. And you see this, I think, in the Committee\nforecast. You want to be at a place where real rates are positive across the entire yield curve.\nAnd I think that would be the case if you look at the numbers that we’re writing down and think\nabout—you measure those against some sort of forward-looking assessment of inflation,\ninflation expectations. I think you would see at that time—you’d see positive real rates across\nthe yield curve, and that is also an important consideration.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Howard.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Hi. Howard Schneider with Reuters. Thanks for the\nopportunity. I just want to be clear on the SEPs. You say it’s meeting by meeting, but it sure\nlooks like we’re going 75–50–25. Is 75 next month the baseline?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we make one decision per meeting, and the decision we made\ntoday was to raise the federal funds rate by 75 [basis points]. You’re right that the median for\nthe year-end suggests another 125 basis points in rate increases, but there’s also, there’s another\nfairly large group that saw a 100 basis points addition to where we are today. So that would be\n25 basis points less. So we’re going to make that decision at the meeting. We didn’t make that\ndecision today; we didn’t vote on that. I would say that we’re committed to getting to a\nrestrictive level for the federal funds rate and getting there pretty quickly, and that’s what we’re\nthinking about.\nPage 10 of 21\nSeptember 21, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. So, just as a follow-up to that, I’m wondering about the sort\nof risk-management considerations here, given there’s some discussion now of overdoing it.\nWhat’s the incentive to continue front-loading right now? Is it lack of progress on inflation seen\nin the CPI reports? Or is it a motivation to get as much done while the job market is still as\nstrong as it is?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, what we’ve seen is, inflation has—our expectation has been that\nwe would begin to see inflation come down, largely because of supply-side healing. By now we\nwould have thought that we’d have seen some of that. We haven’t. We have seen some supply-\nside healing, but inflation has not really come down. If you look at core PCE inflation, which is\na good measure of where inflation is running now, if you look at it on a 3-, 6-, and 12-month\ntrailing annualized basis, you’ll see that inflation is at 4.8 percent, 4.5 percent, and 4.8 percent.\nSo that’s a pretty good summary of where we are with inflation. And that’s not where we\nexpected or wanted to be. So, what that tells us is that we need to continue, and we can—keep\ndoing these, and we did today—do another large increase as we approach the level that we think\nwe need to get to. And we’re still discovering what that level is. But people are writing that\ndown in their SEP where they think policy needs to be. So that’s how we’re thinking about it.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Colby.\nCOLBY SMITH. Thank you. Colby Smith with the Financial Times. Chair Powell,\nhow should we interpret the fact that core inflation is still not forecast in the SEP to be back to\ntarget in 2025, and yet the dot plot projects cuts as early as 2024? And does that mean there’s a\nlevel of inflation above the 2 percent target that the Fed is willing to tolerate?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I guess core is at 2.1 in 2025—in the median—and headline is at\n2.0, so that’s pretty close. I mean, we write down our forecasts, and we figure out what the\nPage 11 of 21\nSeptember 21, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nmedian is, and we publish it. So it’s not—I mean, I would say that if, actually, if the economy\nfollowed this path, this would be a pretty good outcome. But you’re right—it is a tenth higher\nthan 2 percent.\nCOLBY SMITH. Okay. Just as a quick follow-up: I mean, if the concern is that\nunderlying inflation is becoming more entrenched, perhaps, each month, then why forgo the\nmore aggressive 100 basis point increase today, and does that risk having to do more later on?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah. So we, as we said at the last press conference and in between\nthat one and this one, we said that we would make our decision based on the overall data coming\nin. So, if you remember, we got a surprisingly low reading in July and then a surprisingly high\nreading for August. So I think you have to—you can’t really—you never want to overreact too\nmuch to any one data point.\nSo if you look at them together—and, as I just mentioned, if you really look at this year’s\ninflation, 3-, 6-, and 12-month trailing, you see inflation is running too high. It’s running\n4.5 percent or above; you don’t need to know much more than that. If that’s the one thing you\nknow, you know that this Committee is committed to getting to a meaningfully restrictive stance\nof policy and staying there until we feel confident that inflation is coming down. That’s how we\nthink about it.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi. Victoria Guida with Politico. I wanted to ask about the\nbalance sheet. You all have left open the possibility that you might sell mortgage-backed\nsecurities, but we’ve seen significant slowing in the housing market. Mortgage rates have gone\nup significantly, and I’m just wondering whether conditions there might affect your plans for\nhow quickly you have the runoff on the MBS side.\nPage 12 of 21\nSeptember 21, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. So we, what we said, as you know, was that we would consider that\nonce balance sheet runoff is well under way. I would say it’s not something we’re considering\nright now and not something I expect to be considering in the near term. It’s just, it’s something\nI think we will turn to, but that time, the time for turning to it, has not come and is not close.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Will conditions in the housing market affect that decision?\nCHAIR POWELL. I think a number of things might affect that decision, really. The\nmain thing is, we’re not considering that decision, and I don’t expect that we will any time soon.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Neil.\nNEIL IRWIN. Thanks. Neil Irwin with Axios. A number of commentators have come\nto the view, including over at the World Bank, that simultaneous global tightening around the\nworld is, creates a risk of a global recession that’s worse than is necessary to bring inflation\ndown. How do you see that risk? How do you think of coordination with your fellow central\nbankers? And is there much risk of overdoing it on a global level?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we, actually, my colleagues and I, a number of my FOMC\ncolleagues and I, just got back from one of our frequent trips to Basel, Switzerland, to meet with\nother senior central bank officials from around the world. We are in pretty regular contact, and\nwe exchange, of course—we all serve a domestic mandate, domestic objectives—in our case, the\ndual mandate, maximum employment and price stability. But we regularly discuss what we’re\nseeing in terms of our own economy and international spillovers, and it’s a very ongoing,\nconstant kind of a process.\nSo we are very aware of what’s going on in other economies around the world and what\nthat means for us, and vice versa. The forecasts that we put together, that our staff puts together,\nand that we put together on our own always take all of that—try to take all of that into account. I\nPage 13 of 21\nSeptember 21, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nmean, I can’t say that we do it perfectly, but it’s not as if we don’t think about the policy\ndecisions—monetary policy and otherwise—the economic developments that are taking place in\nmajor economies that can have an effect on the U.S. economy. That is very much baked into our\nown forecast and our own understanding of the U.S. economy, as best we can. It won’t be\nperfect.\nSo I don’t see—it’s hard to talk about collaboration in a world where people have very\ndifferent levels of interest rates. If you remember, there were coordinated cuts and raises and\nthings like that at various times, but, really, we’re all, we’re in very different situations. But I\nwill tell you, our contact is more or less ongoing, and it’s not coordination, but there’s a lot of\ninformation sharing. And we all, I think, are informed by what other important economies—\neconomies that are important to the United States—are doing.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Craig.\nCRAIG TORRES. Craig Torres from Bloomberg. Chair Powell, you talked about some\nways the higher interest rates are affecting the economy, but we’ve also seen a resilient labor\nmarket with durable consumption, strong corporate profits, and I’m wondering what your story is\non the resilience of the economy. After all, you and your colleagues said, “Well, we started\ntightening in March when we were talking about interest rates in the future.” And, indeed,\nTreasury rates moved up, so we should have had a lot of tightening taking effect. Why is the\neconomy, in your view, so resilient, and does it mean that we might need a possibly higher\nterminal rate?\nCHAIR POWELL. You’re right, of course—the labor market, in particular, has been\nvery strong. But there are—the sectors of the economy that are most interest rate sensitive are\ncertainly showing the effects of our tightening, and, of course, the obvious example is housing,\nPage 14 of 21\nSeptember 21, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nwhere you see declining activity of all different kinds and house price increases moving down.\nSo we’re having an effect on interest-sensitive spending. I think, through exchange rates, we’re\nhaving an effect on exports and imports. I think—so all of that’s happening, but you’re right,\nand we’ve said this: This is a strong, robust economy. People have savings on their balance\nsheet from the period when they couldn’t spend and where they were getting government\ntransfers. There’s still very significant savings out there, although not as much at the lower end\nof the income spectrum—but still, some savings out there to support growth. The states are very\nflush with cash, so there’s good reason to think that this will continue to be a reasonably strong\neconomy.\nNow, the data sort of are showing that growth is going to be below trend this year. We\nthink of trend as being about 1.8 percent, or in that range. We’re forecasting growth well below\nthat, and most forecasters are. But you’re right—there’s certainly a possibility that growth can\nbe stronger than that. And that’s a good thing, because that means the economy will be more\nresistant to a significant downturn. But, of course, we are focused on the thing I started with,\nwhich is getting inflation back down to 2 percent. We can’t fail to do that. I mean, if we were to\nfail to do that, that would be the thing that would be most painful for the people that we serve.\nSo for now, that has to be our overarching focus, and you see that, I think, in the SEP, in the\nlevels of rates that we’ll be moving to reasonably quickly, assuming things turn out roughly in\nline with the SEP. So that’s how we think about it.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Mike. Thank you.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In a world of euphemisms that we live in\nhere, with “below-trend growth” and “modest increase in unemployment,” I’m wondering if I can\nask you a couple of direct questions for the American people. Do the odds now favor, given where\nPage 15 of 21\nSeptember 21, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nyou are and where you’re going with interest rates, favor a recession? Four point four percent\nunemployment is about 1.3 million jobs. Is that acceptable job loss? And then, given that the data\nyou look at is backward looking, and the lags in your policy are forward looking, and you don’t\nknow what they are, how will you know, or will you know, if you’ve gone too far?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I don’t know what the odds are. I think that there’s a very high\nlikelihood that we’ll have a period of what I’ve mentioned is below-trend growth, by which I\nmean much lower growth, and we’re seeing that now. So the median forecast, I think, this year\namong my colleagues and me was 0.2 percent growth. So that’s very slow growth. And then\nbelow trend next year. I think the median was 1.2, also well below. So that’s a slower, that’s a\nvery slow level of growth, and it could give rise to increases in unemployment. But I think\nthat’s, so that is something that we think we need to have, and we think we need to have softer\nlabor market conditions as well.\nWe’re never going to say that there are too many people working, but the real point is\nthis: Inflation—what we hear from people when we meet with them is that they really are\nsuffering from inflation. And if we want to set ourselves up, really light the way to another\nperiod of a very strong labor market, we have got to get inflation behind us. I wish there were a\npainless way to do that. There isn’t. So, what we need to do is get rates up to the point where\nwe’re putting meaningful downward pressure on inflation, and that’s what we’re doing. And we\ncertainly don’t hope, we certainly haven’t given up the idea that we can have a relatively modest\nincrease in unemployment. Nonetheless, we need to complete this task.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. But how will you know, or will you know, if you’ve gone too far?\nCHAIR POWELL. It’s hard to hypothetically deal with that question. I mean, again, our\nreally tight focus now continues to be ongoing rate increases to get the policy rate up where it\nPage 16 of 21\nSeptember 21, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nneeds to be. And, as I said, you can look at this SEP as today’s estimate of where we think those\nrates would be. Of course, they will evolve over time.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Chris Rugaber.\nCHRIS RUGABER. Thanks. Chris Rugaber, Associated Press. I wanted to follow up\nwith what you just mentioned about the labor market. You’ve said several times that to have the\nlabor market we want, we need price stability, and you suggested maybe there isn’t a tradeoff in\nthe long run. But in the short run, there is a lot of concern, as people have been expressing here,\nabout higher unemployment as a result of these rate hikes or as a result of rate hikes. So can you\nexplain, though, what about high inflation now threatens the job market? I mean, you seem to\nsuggest inflation, high inflation, will eventually lead to a weaker job market. So can you spell\nthat out a little more for the general public on how that would work?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, for starters, people are seeing their wage increases eaten up by\ninflation. So if your family is one where you spend most of your paycheck, every paycheck\ncycle, on gas, food, transportation, clothing, basics of life, and prices go up the way they’ve been\ngoing up, you’re in trouble right away. You don’t have a cushion, and this is very painful for\npeople at the lower end of the income and wealth spectrum. So that’s what we’re hearing from\npeople is, you know, very much—that inflation is really hurting.\nSo how do we get rid of inflation? And, as I mentioned, it would be nice if there were a\nway to just wish it away, but there isn’t. We have to get supply and demand back into alignment,\nand the way we do that is by slowing the economy. Hopefully, we do that by slowing the\neconomy, and we see some softening in labor market conditions, and we see a big contribution\nfrom supply-side improvements, and things like that. But none of that is guaranteed.\nPage 17 of 21\nSeptember 21, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nIn any case, we, our job is to deliver price stability, and I think—you can think of price\nstability as an asset that just delivers large benefits to society over a long period of time. We\nreally saw that for a long time. The United States had 2 percent inflation, didn’t move around\nmuch, and that was enormously beneficial to the public that we serve. And we have to get back\nto that and keep it for another long period of time. To pull back from the task of doing that is,\nyou’re just postponing—the record shows that if you postpone that, the delay is only likely to\nlead to more pain. So I think we’re moving to do what we need to do and do our jobs, and that’s\nwhat you see us doing.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Edward.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you for taking the question, Mr. Chairman. Edward\nLawrence for Fox Business. So you had said that Americans and businesses need to feel some\neconomic pain as we go forward. How long from here should Americans be prepared for that\neconomic pain?\nCHAIR POWELL. How long? I mean, it really depends on how long it takes for wages\nand, more than that, prices to come down for inflation to come down. And so what you see in\nour projections today is that inflation moves down significantly over the course of next year and\nthen more the next year after that. And I think once you’re on that path, that’s a good thing.\nAnd things will start to feel better to people—they’ll feel lower inflation, they’ll feel that the\neconomy is improving. And also, if our projections are close to right, you’ll see that the costs in\nunemployment are, they’re meaningful, and they’re certainly very meaningful to the people who\nlose their jobs. And we talk about that in our meetings quite a lot.\nBut, at the same time, we’d be setting the economy up for another long period—this era\nhas been noted for very long expansions. We’ve had three of the four longest in measured\nPage 18 of 21\nSeptember 21, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nhistory since we got inflation under control. And that’s not an accident. So when inflation is\nlow and stable, you can have these 9, 10, 11—10-year, anyway, expansions, and you can see\nwhat we saw in 2018, ’19, and ’20, which was very low unemployment, the biggest wage gains\ngoing to people at the low end of the spectrum, the smallest racial gaps that we’ve seen since we\nstarted keeping track of that. So we want to get back to that. But, to get there, we’re going to\nhave to get supply and demand back in alignment, and that’s going to take tight monetary policy\nfor a period of time.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. As a follow-up, what is that economic pain in your mind? Is\nit job losses? Is it higher interest rates on credit cards? What is that economic pain?\nCHAIR POWELL. So it’s all of those things. Higher interest rates, slower growth, and a\nsoftening labor market are all painful for the public that we serve. But they’re not as painful as\nfailing to restore price stability and then having to come back and do it down the road again and\ndoing it at a time when, actually, now people have really come to expect high inflation. If the\nconcept of high inflation becomes entrenched in people’s economic thinking about their\ndecisions, then sort of getting back to price stability—the cost of getting back to price stability\njust rises, and so we want to avoid that. We want to act aggressively now and get this job done\nand keep at it until it’s done.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nicole, from CNN.\nNICOLE GOODKIND. Thank you, Chairman Powell. Nicole Goodkind, CNN\nBusiness. Existing home sales have fallen for seven months straight, mortgage rates are at their\nhighest level since 2008, yet mortgage demand increased this week, and housing prices are still\nelevated. Now, at the end of your June press conference, you mentioned plans to reset the\nPage 19 of 21\nSeptember 21, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nhousing market. I was wondering if you could elaborate on what you mean when you say “reset”\nand what you think it will take to actually get there.\nCHAIR POWELL. So when I say “reset,” I’m not looking at a particular, specific set of\ndata or anything. What I’m really saying is that we’ve had a time of a red-hot housing market all\nover the country, where, famously, houses were selling to the first buyer at 10 percent above the\nask, before even seeing the house. That kind of thing. So there was a big imbalance between\nsupply and demand. Housing prices were going up at an unsustainably fast level. So the\ndeceleration in housing prices that we’re seeing should help bring sort of prices more closely in\nline with rents and other housing market fundamentals, and that’s a good thing.\nFor the longer term, what we need is supply and demand to get better aligned so that\nhousing prices go up at a reasonable level—at a reasonable pace—and that people can afford\nhouses again. And I think we—so we probably, in the housing market, have to go through a\ncorrection to get back to that place. There’s also, there are also longer-run issues, though, with\nthe housing market. As you know, we’re—it’s difficult to find lots now close enough to cities\nand things like that, so builders are having a hard time getting zoning and lots and workers and\nmaterials and things like that. But from a sort of business cycle standpoint, this difficult\ncorrection should put the housing market back into better balance.\nNICOLE GOODKIND. Just to follow, though, shelter made up such a large part of this\nhot CPI report that we saw. Do you think that there is a lag and that we will see that come down\nin the coming months? Or do you think that there’s still this imbalance that needs to be\naddressed?\nCHAIR POWELL. I think that shelter inflation is going to remain high for some time.\nWe’re looking for it to come down, but it’s not exactly clear when that will happen. So it may\nPage 20 of 21\nSeptember 21, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ntake some time, so I think, hope for the best, plan for the worst. So I think, on shelter inflation,\nyou’ve just got to assume that it’s going to remain pretty high for a while.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Okay, we’ll go to Jean for the last question.\nJEAN YUNG. Hi. Jean Yung with Market News. You’ve talked about the need to get\nreal rates into positive territory, and you said earlier that policy is just moving into that territory\nnow. So I’m curious, how restrictive is rates at 4.6 percent expected—is that expected to be next\nyear? How restrictive?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think if you look, when we get to—if we—let’s assume we do\nget to that level, which I think is likely. What you’re going to do is, you’re going to adjust that\nfor some forward-looking measure of inflation. And that could be—you pick your measure. It\ncould be—there are all kinds of different things you could pick and you get—but what you’ll get\nis a positive number. In all cases, you will get forward inflation expectations in the short term, I\nthink, that are going to be, assuming that we’re doing our jobs appropriately, that will be\nsignificant.\nSo you’ll have a positive [real] federal funds rate at that point, which could be 1 percent\nor so, but—I mean, I don’t know exactly what it would be. But it would be significantly positive\nwhen we get to that level. And let me say, we’ve written down what we think is a plausible path\nfor the federal funds rate. The path that we actually execute will be enough. It will be enough to\nrestore price stability. So this is something that, as you can see, they’ve moved up, and we’re\ngoing to continue to watch incoming data and the evolving outlook and ask ourselves whether\nour policy is in the right place as we go.\nThank you very much.\nPage 21 of 21"

    "press_conf": "November 2, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nTranscript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference\nNovember 2, 2022\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. My colleagues and I are strongly committed to\nbringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal. We have both the tools that we need and the\nresolve it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses. Price\nstability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy.\nWithout price stability, the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price\nstability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.\nToday, the FOMC raised our policy interest rate by 75 basis points. And we continue to\nanticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate. We are moving our policy stance\npurposefully to a level that will be sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent. In\naddition, we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet.\nRestoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive stance of policy for some\ntime. I will have more to say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing\neconomic developments.\nThe U.S. economy has slowed significantly from last year’s rapid pace. Real GDP rose\nat a pace of 2.6 percent last quarter but is unchanged so far this year. Recent indicators point to\nmodest growth of spending and production this quarter. Growth in consumer spending has\nslowed from last year’s rapid pace, in part reflecting lower real disposable income and tighter\nfinancial conditions. Activity in the housing sector has weakened significantly, largely reflecting\nhigher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be\nweighing on business fixed investment.\nDespite the slowdown in growth, the labor market remains extremely tight, with the\nunemployment rate at a 50-year low, job vacancies still very high, and wage growth elevated.\nPage 1 of 23\nNovember 2, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nJob gains have been robust, with employment rising by an average of 289,000 jobs per month\nover August and September. Although job vacancies have moved below their highs and the pace\nof job gains has slowed from earlier in the year, the labor market continues to be out of balance,\nwith demand substantially exceeding the supply of available workers. The labor force\nparticipation rate is little changed since the beginning of the year.\nInflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. Over the 12 months\nending in September, total PCE prices rose 6.2 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy\ncategories, core PCE prices rose 5.1 percent. And the recent inflation data again have come in\nhigher than expected. Price pressures remain evident across a broad range of goods and services.\nRussia’s war against Ukraine has boosted prices for energy and food and has created additional\nupward pressure on inflation.\nDespite elevated inflation, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well\nanchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as\nwell as measures from financial markets. But that is not grounds for complacency; the longer the\ncurrent bout of high inflation continues, the greater the chance that expectations of higher\ninflation will become entrenched.\nThe Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware\nthat high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for\nthose least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We\nare highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are\nstrongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.\nPage 2 of 23\nNovember 2, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nAt today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by\n75 basis points. And we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our\nbalance sheet, which plays an important role in firming the stance of monetary policy.\nWith today’s action, we have raised interest rates by 3¾ percentage points this year. We\nanticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate\nin order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to\n2 percent over time. Financial conditions have tightened significantly in response to our policy\nactions, and we are seeing the effects on demand in the most interest-rate-sensitive sectors of the\neconomy, such as housing. It will take time, however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to\nbe realized, especially on inflation. That’s why we say in our statement that in determining the\npace of future increases in the target range, we will take into account the cumulative tightening\nof monetary policy and the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and\ninflation. At some point—as I’ve said in the last two press conferences—it will become\nappropriate to slow the pace of increases as we approach the level of interest rates that will be\nsufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our 2 percent goal. There is significant\nuncertainty around that level of interest rates. Even so, we still have some ways to go, and\nincoming data since our last meeting suggest that the ultimate level of interest rates will be\nhigher than previously expected. Our decisions will depend on the totality of incoming data and\ntheir implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation. We will continue to make\nour decisions meeting by meeting and communicate our thinking as clearly as possible.\nWe are taking forceful steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better alignment\nwith supply. Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our\n2 percent goal and to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Reducing inflation\nPage 3 of 23\nNovember 2, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nis likely to require a sustained period of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market\nconditions. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum\nemployment and stable prices in the longer run. The historical record cautions strongly against\nprematurely loosening policy. We will stay the course until the job is done.\nTo conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and\nbusinesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the\nFed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.\nThank you, and I look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Colby.\nCOLBY SMITH. Thank you. Colby Smith with the Financial Times. On the need to\nslow the pace of rate increases at some point: Is a downshift contingent on a string of better\ninflation data specifically between now and, let’s say, the December meeting? Or is that\nsomething that the Fed could potentially proceed with, independent of that data, given the lagged\neffects that you mentioned?\nCHAIR POWELL. So a couple things on that. We do need to see inflation coming down\ndecisively, and good evidence of that would be a series of down monthly readings. Of course,\nthat’s what we’d all love to see, but that’s—I’ve never thought of that as the appropriate test for\nslowing the pace of increases or for identifying the appropriately restrictive level that we’re\naiming for. We need to bring our policy stance down to a level that’s sufficiently restrictive to\nbring inflation down to our 2 percent objective over the medium term. How will we know that\nwe’ve reached that level? Well, we’ll take into account the full range of analysis and data that\nbear on that question, guided by our assessment of how much financial conditions have\ntightened, the effects that that tightening is actually having on the real economy and on inflation,\nPage 4 of 23\nNovember 2, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ntaking into consideration lags, as I mentioned. We will be looking at real rates, for example, all\nacross the yield curve and all other financial conditions as we make that assessment.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Howard.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Hi, Howard Schneider with Reuters. I’m sure there’s going\nto be tons of confusion out there about whether this means you’re going to slow in December or\nnot. Would you say that the bias right now is not for another 75 basis point increase?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, what I want to do is put that question of pace in the context of\nour broader tightening program, if I may, and talk about the statement language along the way.\nSo I think you can think about our tightening program as really addressing three questions, the\nfirst of which was, and has been, how fast to go. The second is how high to raise our policy rate.\nAnd the third will be, eventually, how long to remain at a restrictive level.\nSo on the first question—how fast to tighten policy—it’s been very important that we\nmove expeditiously, and we have clearly done so. We’ve moved 3¾ percent since March,\nadmittedly from a base of zero. It’s a historically fast pace, and that’s certainly appropriate given\nthe persistence and strength in inflation and the low level from which we started.\nSo now we come to the second question, which is how high to raise our policy rate. And\nwe’re saying that we’d raise that rate to a level that’s sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation to\nour 2 percent target over time, and we put that into our postmeeting statement because that really\ndoes become the important question, we think now, is how far to go. And I’ll talk more about\nthat. We think there’s some ground to cover before we meet that test, and that’s why we say that\nongoing rate increases will be appropriate. And, as I mentioned, incoming data between the\nmeetings, both a strong labor market report but particularly the CPI report, do suggest to me that\nPage 5 of 23\nNovember 2, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nwe may ultimately move to higher levels than we thought at the time of the September meeting.\nThat level is very uncertain, though, and I would say we’re going to find it over time.\nOf course, with the lags between policy and economic activity, there’s a lot of\nuncertainty, so we note that in determining the pace of future increases, we’ll take into account\nthe cumulative tightening of monetary policy as well as the lags with which monetary policy\naffects economic activity and inflation. So I would say, as we come closer to that level, move\nmore into restrictive territory, the question of speed becomes less important than the second and\nthird questions. And that’s why I’ve said at the last two press conferences that at some point, it\nwill become appropriate to slow the pace of increases. So that time is coming, and it may come\nas soon as the next meeting or the one after that. No decision has been made. It is likely we’ll\nhave a discussion about this at the next meeting, a discussion. To be clear, let me say again\n[that] the question of when to moderate the pace of increases is now much less important than\nthe question of how high to raise rates and how long to keep monetary policy restricted, which\nreally will be our principal focus.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. If I could follow up on that, to what degree was there an\nimportance or weight given to a need to signal this possibility now, given all the concerns, really\naround the globe, about Fed policy sort of driving ahead and everybody else dealing with their\nown stress as a result?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, I think I’m pleased that we have moved as fast as we have. I\ndon’t think we’ve overtightened. I think there’s—very difficult to make a case that our current\nlevel is too tight, given that inflation still runs well above the federal funds rate. So I think that\nat this meeting, as in the last two meetings, as I’ve mentioned, I’ve said that we—that there\nwould come a point, and this was a meeting at which we had a discussion about what that might\nPage 6 of 23\nNovember 2, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nmean. And we did discuss this, and, as I mentioned, we’ll discuss it again in December. But\nthere’s no—I don’t have any sense that we’ve overtightened or moved too fast. I think it’s been\ngood and a successful program that we’ve gotten this far this fast. Remember, though, that we\nstill think there’s a need for ongoing rate increases, and we have some ground left to cover here,\nand cover it we will.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nick.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, core PCE\ninflation on a 3- or 6-month annualized basis and on a 12-month basis has been running in the\nhigh 4s, close to 5 percent. Is there any reason to think you won’t have to raise rates at least\nabove that level to be confident that you are imparting enough restraint to bring inflation down?\nCHAIR POWELL. So this is the question of, does the policy rate need to get above the\ninflation rate? And I would say, there are a range of views on it. That’s the classic “Taylor\nprinciple” view. But I would think you’d look more at a forward, a forward-looking measure of\ninflation to look at that. But I think the answer is, we’ll want to get the policy rate to a level\nwhere it is, where the real interest rate is positive. We will want to do that. I do not think of it as\nthe single and only touchstone, though. I think you put some weight on that; you also put some\nweight on rates across the curve. Very few people borrow at the short end—at the federal funds\nrate, for example. So households and businesses, if they’re [borrowing]—[there are] very\nmeaningfully positive interest rates all across the curve for them, credit spreads are larger, so\nborrowing rates are significantly higher, and I think financial conditions have tightened quite a\nbit. So I would look at that as an important feature. I’d put some weight on it, but I wouldn’t\nsay it’s something that is the single, dominant thing to look at.\nPage 7 of 23\nNovember 2, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nNICK TIMIRAOS. If I could follow up: What is your best assessment, or the staff’s\nbest assessment right now, of the current rate of underlying inflation?\nCHAIR POWELL. I don’t have a specific number for you there. There are many, many\nmodels that look at that. And, I mean, one way to look at it is that it’s a pretty stationary object\nand that when inflation runs—above that level, for sure—substantially above for some time,\nyou’ll see it move up, but the movement will be fairly gradual. So I think that’s what the\nprincipal models would tend to say. But I wouldn’t want to land on any one assessment. There\nare many different—as you know, many different people publish an assessment of underlying\ninflation.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jeanna.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you for taking our questions. Jeanna\nSmialek with the New York Times. I wondered, do you see any evidence at this stage that\ninflation is, or is at risk of becoming, entrenched?\nCHAIR POWELL. Is inflation becoming entrenched? So I guess I would start by\npointing to expectations. So if we saw longer-term expectations moving up, that would be very\ntroubling. And they were moving up a little bit at the middle part of this year, and they’ve\nmoved now back down. That’s one piece of data. Shorter-term inflation expectations moved up\nbetween the last meeting and this meeting, and we don’t think those are as indicative, but they\nmay be important in the wage-setting process. There’s a school of thought that believes that. So\nthat’s very concerning.\nI guess the other thing I would say is that the longer we have—we’re now 18 months into\nthis episode of high inflation, and we don’t have a clearly identified, scientific way of\nPage 8 of 23\nNovember 2, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nunderstanding at what point inflation becomes entrenched. And so the thing we need to do from\na risk-management standpoint is to use our tools forcefully but thoughtfully and get inflation\nunder control—get it down to 2 percent—get it behind us. That’s what we really need to do and\nwhat we’re strongly committed to doing.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Rachel.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you for taking our questions. Rachel\nSiegel from the Washington Post. The statement points to lag times. I’m wondering if you can\nwalk us through how you judge those lag effects, what that timeline looks like over the coming\nmonths or even a year, and where you would expect it to show up in different parts of the\neconomy.\nCHAIR POWELL. So the way I would think about that is, it’s commonly, for a long\ntime, thought that monetary policy works with “long and variable lags,” and that it works first on\nfinancial conditions and then on economic activity and then perhaps later than that even on\ninflation. So that’s been the thinking for a long time. There was an old literature that made\nthose lags out to be fairly long. There’s newer literature that says that they’re shorter. The truth\nis, we don’t have a lot of data [consisting] of inflation of [rates] this high in what is, now, the\nmodern economy. One big difference now is that it used to be that you would raise the federal\nfunds rate, financial conditions would react, and then that would affect economic activity and\ninflation. Now financial conditions react well before in expectation of monetary policy [actions].\nThat’s the way it has moved for a quarter of a century—in the direction of financial conditions,\nthen monetary policy—because the markets are thinking, what is the central bank going to do?\nAnd there are plenty of economists that also think that once financial conditions change, that the\neffects on the economy are actually faster than they would have been before. We don’t know\nPage 9 of 23\nNovember 2, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthat. I guess the thing that I would say is: It’s highly uncertain—highly uncertain. And so from\na risk-management standpoint—but we do need, it would be irresponsible not to, to ignore them.\nBut you want to consider them but not take them literally. So I think it’s a very difficult place to\nbe, but I would tend to be—want to be in the middle looking carefully at what’s actually\nhappening with the economy and trying to make good decisions from a risk-management\nstandpoint, remembering, of course, that if we were to overtighten, we could then use our tools\nstrongly to support the economy, whereas if we don’t get inflation under control because we\ndon’t tighten enough, now we’re in a situation where inflation will become entrenched and the\ncosts, the employment costs in particular, will be much higher potentially. So from a risk-\nmanagement standpoint, we want to be sure that we don’t make the mistake of either failing to\ntighten enough or loosening policy too soon.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. And if I could follow up: Should we interpret the addition to the\nstatement to mean that more weight is put into those lag effects than they would have been after\nprevious rate hikes?\nCHAIR POWELL. I think as we move now into restrictive territory, as we make these\nongoing rate hikes and policy becomes more restrictive, it’ll be appropriate now to be thinking\nmore about lags. Of course, we think about lags—the lags are just sort of a basic part of\nmonetary policy. But we will be thinking about them, but we won’t be—I think we’ll be\nconsidering them but because it’s appropriate to do so. Let me say this: It is very premature to\nbe thinking about pausing. So people, when they hear lags, they think about a pause. It’s very\npremature, in my view, to think about or be talking about pausing our rate hike. We have a ways\nto go. Our policy—we need ongoing rate hikes to get to that level of sufficiently restrictive.\nAnd we don’t—of course, we don’t really know exactly where that is. We have a sense, and\nPage 10 of 23\nNovember 2, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nwe’ll write down in September—sorry, in the December meeting, a new Summary of Economic\nProjections, which updates that. But I would expect us to continue to update it based on what\nwe’re seeing with incoming data.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Neil Irwin.\nNEIL IRWIN. Thanks, Chair Powell. Neil Irwin, Axios. As you look around the\neconomy, the clearest impact of your tightening so far has been on housing, maybe some\nventure-funded tech companies. It’s been relatively narrow in terms of the labor market,\nconsumer demand; a lot of sectors, you don’t see a ton of effect. Is the pathway and channels\nthrough which monetary policy works changing? Is it narrower than it used to be? And on\nhousing in particular, are you at all worried that you’re cramping housing supply in ways that\nmight cause problems down the road?\nCHAIR POWELL. I don’t know that the channels through which policy works have\nchanged that much. I would say a big channel is the labor market, and the labor market is very,\nvery strong. Very strong. And households, of course, have strong balance sheets. So we go into\nthis with a strong labor market and excess demand in the labor market, as you can see through\nmany different things, and also with households who have strong spending power built up. So it\nmay take time, it may take resolve, it may take patience. It’s likely to, to get inflation down. It\nmay—I think you see, from our forecasts and others, that it will take some time for inflation to\ncome down. It’ll take time, we think. So, sorry, was I getting to your question there?\nNEIL IRWIN. Housing.\nCHAIR POWELL. Oh, housing—the housing part of it. Yes, so we look at housing—of\ncourse, housing is significantly affected by these higher rates, which are really back where they\nwere before the Global Financial Crisis—they’re not historically high, but they’re much higher\nPage 11 of 23\nNovember 2, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthan they’ve been. And you’re seeing housing activity decline, and you’re seeing housing prices\ngrowing at a faster rate and, in some parts of the country, declining. You know, I would say\nhousing was—the housing market was very overheated for the couple of years after the\npandemic as demand increased and rates were low. We all know the stories of how overheated\nthe housing market was, prices going up. Many, many bidders and no conditions, that kind of\nthing. So the housing market needs to get back into a balance between supply and demand.\nWe’re well aware of what’s going on there. From a financial stability standpoint, we didn’t see\nin this cycle the kinds of poor credit underwriting that we saw before the Global Financial Crisis.\nHousing credit was very carefully—much more carefully managed by the lenders. So it’s a very\ndifferent situation and doesn’t present potential financial—doesn’t appear to present financial\nstability issues. But, no, we do understand that that’s really where a very big effect of our\npolicy is.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico. I wanted to ask about the labor\nmarket. You mentioned early on, again, that job openings are very high compared to available\nworkers, and I’m just curious to what extent you do and don’t draw signal from that. So, for\nexample, if wage growth is slowing and if maybe the unemployment rate starts to tick up, will\nthat make you sort of decrease your focus on job openings? What do you see—are wages what’s\nreally important? How are you thinking about the labor market as it relates to inflation?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we talk a lot about vacancies in the—vacancy-to-unemployed\nrate, but it’s just one, it’s just another data series. It’s been unusually important in this cycle\nbecause it’s been so out of line. But so has quits. So have wages. So we look at a very wide\nrange of data on the unemployment—on the labor market. So I’d start with unemployment,\nPage 12 of 23\nNovember 2, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nwhich is typically the single statistic you would look to, is at a 50-year low, 3½ percent. We’re\ngetting really nothing in labor supply now. We had, I think, very small increase this year, which\nwe had really thought, we thought we would get that back. Most analysts thought we would get\nsome labor supply coming in.\nYou mentioned wages, so I guess I would characterize that as sort of a mixed picture.\nIt’s true, with average hourly earnings, you see—so I would call it a flattening out at a level\nthat’s well above the level that would be consistent over time with 2 percent inflation, assuming\na reasonable productivity. With the ECI reading this week, again, a mixed picture. The headline\nnumber was a disappointment. Let’s just say it was high. It didn’t show a decline. There’s\nsome rays of light inside that if you look at private-sector workers—that did come down, that\ncompensation did come down. Overall, though, the broader picture is of an overheated labor\nmarket where demand substantially exceeds supply. Job creation still exceeds sort of the level\nthat would hold the market where it is. So that’s the picture.\nDo we see—we keep looking for signs that sort of the beginning of a gradual softening is\nhappening. And maybe that’s there, but it’s not obvious to me, because wages aren’t coming\ndown—they’re just moving sideways at an elevated level, both ECI and average hourly earnings.\nWe want to see—we would love to see vacancies coming down, quits coming down. They are\ncoming down. Vacancies are below their all-time high but not by as much as we thought,\nbecause—and the data series is volatile, we never take any one reading, we always look at two or\nthree. So it’s a mixed picture. I don’t see the case for real softening just yet. But we look at, I\nguess as I just showed you, we look at a very broad range of data on the labor market.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. So do you see wages as being a significant driver of inflation?\nPage 13 of 23\nNovember 2, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. I think wages have an effect on inflation and inflation has an effect\non wages. I think that’s always been the case. There’s always—going back and forth, the\nquestion is, is that really elevated right now? I don’t think so. I don’t think wages are the\nprincipal story of why prices are going up. I don’t think that. I also don’t think that we see a\nwage–price spiral, but, again, it’s not something you can—once you see it, you’re in trouble. So\nwe don’t want to see it. We want wages to go up—we just want them to go up at a level that’s\nsustainable and consistent with 2 percent inflation. And we think we can—we do think that,\ngiven the data that we have, that this labor market can soften without having to soften as much as\nhistory would indicate through the unemployment channel. It can soften through job openings\ndeclining. We think there’s room for that. But we won’t know that—that’ll be, that’ll be\ndiscovered empirically.\nKAYLA TAUSCHE. Thank you so much. Kayla Tausche from CNBC. Earlier last\nmonth, the United Nations warned that there could be a global recession if central banks didn’t\nchange course. The new U.K. prime minister warned of a profound economic crisis there. And\nI’m wondering how the Fed is weighing international developments in light of a very strong\neconomy here in the U.S. that would seem to be bucking those trends.\nCHAIR POWELL. So, of course, we, we keep close tabs on economic developments and\nalso geopolitical developments that are relevant to the economy abroad. We’re in very frequent\ncontact with our foreign counterparts both through the IMF meetings and the regular meetings\nwith central banks that we have, and I have one this weekend with many, many central bankers.\nSo we’re in touch with all of that. So I guess what—it’s clearly a time, a difficult time in the\nglobal economy. We’re seeing very high inflation in Europe, significantly because of high\nenergy prices related to the war in Ukraine. And we’re seeing China’s having issues with the\nPage 14 of 23\nNovember 2, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nzero-COVID policy and much slower growth than we’re used to seeing. So we’re seeing—we\nsee those difficulties. The strong dollar is a challenge for some countries. But we haven’t—we\ntake all of that into account in our models. We think about the spillovers and that sort of thing.\nHere in the United States, we have a strong economy, and we have an economy where\ninflation is running at 5 percent. Core PCE inflation—which is a really good indicator of what’s\ngoing on for us, the way we see it—is running at 5.1 percent on a 12-month basis and sort of\nsimilar to that on a 3-, 6-, and 9-month basis. So we know that we need to use our tools to get\ninflation under control. The world’s not going to be better off if we fail to do that. That’s a task\nwe need to do. Price stability in the United States is a good thing for the global economy over a\nlong period of time. Price stability is the kind of thing that pays dividends for our economy—for\ndecades, hopefully—even though it may be difficult to get it back. Getting it back is something\nthat gives—that provides value to the people we serve for the long run.\nKAYLA TAUSCHE. If I could just follow up up on that—thank you. The Fed has\nacknowledged in the past that the tools that you have don’t affect things like energy and food\nprices that stem from some of those conflicts overseas, and they’re some of the biggest pain\npoints for consumers. So as you pursue the current path that you’ve outlined, is there a risk that\nsome of those prices simply don’t come down?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we don’t directly affect, for the most part, food and energy prices,\nbut the demand channel does affect them just at the margin. The thing about the United States is\nthat we also have strong—in many other jurisdictions, the principal problem really is energy. In\nthe United States, we also have a demand issue. We’ve got an imbalance between demand and\nsupply, which you see in many parts of the economy. So our tools are well suited to work on\nthat problem, and that’s what we’re doing. You’re right, though. We don’t—the price of oil is\nPage 15 of 23\nNovember 2, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nset globally, and it’s not something we can affect. I think by the actions that we take, though, we\nhelp keep longer-term inflation expectations anchored and keep the public believing in 2 percent\ninflation by the things that we do, even in times when energy is part of the story of why inflation\nis high.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jonnelle.\nJONNELLE MARTE. Hi, Chair Powell. Jonnelle Marte with Bloomberg. So the Fed is\nfacing two more ethics-related incidents with the revision of the financial statements from\nPresident Bostic and President Bullard speaking at a closed event. So some senators, like\nElizabeth Warren, are saying that this is a sign of greater ethics problems at the Fed. Could you\ntalk about what this does to the public’s trust in the bank and what the Fed is doing to prevent\nthis kind of behavior from becoming common?\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So you’re right—the public’s trust is really the Fed’s and any\ncentral bank’s most important asset, and any time one of us, one of the policymakers, violates or\nfalls short of those rules, we do risk undermining that trust, and we take that very seriously. We\ndo. So at the beginning of our meeting yesterday, actually, we had a Committee discussion of\nthe full Committee on the importance of holding ourselves individually and collectively\naccountable for knowing and following the high standard that’s set out in our existing rules with\nrespect to both personal investment activities and external communications. And we’ve taken a\nnumber of steps, and I would just say we do understand how important those issues are. I would\nsay that our new investment program that we have is up now and running, and, actually, it was\nthrough that that the problems with President Bostic’s disclosures were discovered, when he filed\nhis new disclosure. We now have a central group here at the Board of Governors that looks into\ndisclosures and follows them and approves people’s disclosures and also all of their trades. Any\nPage 16 of 23\nNovember 2, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ntrade anyone has to make is covered, has to be approved, preapproved, and there’s a lag—it has\nto be preapproved 45 days before it happens, so there’s no ability to game markets. So it’s a\nreally good system. It worked here. And we—I think we all said to each other today—\nyesterday, actually, yesterday morning, we recommitted to each other and to this institution to\nhold ourselves to the highest standards and avoid these problems.\nJONNELLE MARTE. Do you have an update on the investigations that are pending?\nCHAIR POWELL. I don’t. So, as you know, I referred the matter concerning President\nBostic to the inspector general, and once that happens, I don’t discuss it with the inspector\ngeneral or with anybody. It’s just—the inspector general has, he has the ability to do\ninvestigations. We don’t really have that. So that’s what he’s doing.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Michael.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio. Earlier\nthis year, you touted the three-month bill yield out to 18 months as the yield curve with 100\npercent explanatory power. And you said, quote, “If it’s inverted, that means the Fed’s going to\ncut, which means the economy is weak.” That curve is only 2 basis points away from inversion\nnow, so I’m wondering why you are so confident that you have not overtightened, particularly\ngiven that rates work with a lag.\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, so we do monitor the near-term forward spread—you’re right.\nAnd it’s—that’s been our preferred measure. We think, just empirically, it dominates the ones\nthat people tend to look at, which is 2s, 10s, and things like that. So it’s not inverted. And, also,\nyou have to look at why things—why the rate curve is doing what it’s doing. It can be doing that\nbecause it affects—it expects cuts or because it expects inflation to come down. In this case, if\nyou’re in a situation where the markets are pricing in significant declines in inflation, that’s\nPage 17 of 23\nNovember 2, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ngoing to affect the forward curve. So, yes, we monitor it. You’re right. And that’s what I\nwould say.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. If I could follow up: You also said several meetings ago that the\nrisk of doing too little outweighed the risk of doing too much. Is what you’re trying to tell us\ntoday is that that risk assessment has changed a little bit?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, what’s happened is, time has passed, and we’ve raised interest\nrates by 375 basis points. I would not—I would not change a word in that statement, though. I\nthink until we get inflation down, you’ll be hearing that from me. Again, if we overtighten—and\nwe don’t want to, we want to get this exactly right—but if we overtighten, then we have the\nability with our tools, which are powerful, to, as we showed at the beginning of the pandemic\nepisode, we can support economic activity strongly if that happens, if that’s necessary. On the\nother hand, if you make the mistake in the other direction and you let this drag on, then it’s a\nyear or two down the road, and you’re realizing, inflation behaving the way it can, you’re\nrealizing you didn’t actually get it, you have to go back in. By then, the risk, really, is that it has\nbecome entrenched in people’s thinking. And the record is that the employment costs—the cost\nto the people that we don’t want to hurt—they go up with the passage of time. That’s really how\nI look at it. So that isn’t going to change. What has changed, though—you’re right—is, we’re\nfarther along now. And I think as we’re farther along, we’re now focused on that. What’s the\nplace, what’s the level we need to get to rates? And I don’t know what we’ll do when we get\nthere, by the way. It doesn’t—we’ll have to see. There’s been no decision or discussion around\nexactly what steps we would take at that point. But the first thing is to find your way there.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Chris Rugaber.\nPage 18 of 23\nNovember 2, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Thank you. Chris Rugaber at Associated Press. Just to\ngo back to housing for a minute: You mentioned the impact that rate increases have had on\nhousing—home sales are down 25 percent in the past year, and so forth—but none of this is\nreally showing up in, as you know, in the government’s inflation measures. And as we go\nforward, private real-time data is clearly showing these hits to housing. Are you going to need to\nput a greater weight on that in order to ascertain things like whether there’s overtightening going\non, or will you still focus as much on the more lagging government indicators?\nCHAIR POWELL. So this is an interesting subject. So I start by saying, I guess, that the\nmeasure that’s in the CPI and the PCE, it captures rents for all tenants, not just new leases. And\nthat makes sense, actually, because for that reason—conceptually, that is—that’s sort of the right\ntarget for monetary policy. And the same thing is true for owners’ equivalent rent, which comes\noff of—it’s a reweighting of tenant rents.\nThe private measures are, of course, good at picking up, at the margin, the new leases,\nand they tell you a couple things. One thing is, I think right now, if you look at the pattern of\nthat series of the new leases, it’s very pro-cyclical, so rents went up much more than the CPI and\nPCE rents did. And now they’re coming down faster. But what you’re—the implication is that\nthere are still, as people, as non-new leases roll over and expire, right, they’re still in the pipeline,\nthere’s still some significant rate increases coming, okay? But at some point, once you get\nthrough that, the new leases are going to tell you—what they’re telling you is, there will come a\npoint at which rent inflation will start to come down. But that point is well out from where we\nare now. So we’re well aware of that, of course, and we look at it. But I would say that in terms\nof—the right way to think about inflation, really, is to look at the measure that we do look at, but\nconsidering that we also know that at some point, you’ll see rents coming down.\nPage 19 of 23\nNovember 2, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Great, and just a quick follow. It looks like stock and\nbond markets are reacting positively to your announcement so far. Is that something you wanted\nto see? Is that a problem or what—how that might affect your future policy to see this positive\nreaction?\nCHAIR POWELL. We’re not targeting any one or two particular things. Our message\nshould be—what I’m trying to do is make sure that our message is clear, which is that we think\nwe have a ways to go, we have some ground to cover with interest rates before we get to, before\nwe get to that level of interest rates that we think is sufficiently restrictive. And putting that in\nthe statement and identifying that as a goal is an important step. And that’s meant to put that\nquestion, really, as the important one now, going forward.\nI’ve also said that we think that the level of rates that we estimated in September—the\nincoming data suggests that that’s actually going to be higher, and that’s been the pattern. I\nmean, I would have little confidence that the forecast—if we made a forecast today, if we were\ndoing an SEP today, the pattern has been that, one after another, they go up, and that’ll end when\nit ends, but there’s no sense that inflation is coming down. If you look at the—I have a table of\nthe last 12 months of 12-month readings, and there’s really no pattern there. We’re exactly\nwhere we were a year ago. So I would also say, it’s premature to discuss pausing. And it’s not\nsomething that we’re thinking about. That’s really not a conversation to be had now. We have a\nways to go.\nAnd the last thing I’ll say is that I would want people to understand our commitment to\ngetting this done and to not making the mistake of not doing enough or the mistake of\nwithdrawing our strong policy and doing that too soon. So those—I control those messages, and\nthat’s my job.\nPage 20 of 23\nNovember 2, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMICHELLE SMITH. Edward.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Edward Lawrence with Fox Business. Thank you, Fed\nChairman. So how big of a headwind is all the fiscal spending to what the Federal Reserve’s\ntrying to do to get inflation back to the 2 percent target?\nCHAIR POWELL. In theory, it was a headwind this year, but I do think the broader\ncontext is that you have households that have these significant amounts of savings and can keep\nspending even in—so I think those two things do tend to wage—to sort of counterbalance each\nother out. It appears, consumer spending is still positive—it’s at pretty modest growth levels.\nIt’s not shrinking. The banks that deal with retail customers and many retailers will tell you that\nthe consumers are still buying and they’re still—they’re fine. So I don’t know how big the fiscal\nheadwinds are, and they haven’t shown up in the way that we thought they would in restraining\nspending. So it must have to do with the savings that people have.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. So, what about the spending? There’s tens of billions yet to\nbe spent, I mean, from the Inflation Reduction Act, the American Rescue Plan, CHIPS Act,\nbipartisan infrastructure bill. How does that play into your thinking about the future?\nCHAIR POWELL. Demand is going to have some support from those savings and also\nfrom the strong demand that’s still in the labor market. We still see pretty significant demand\nand a tightening labor market in some respects, although I think, overall, I would say it’s not\nreally tightening or loosening. So we see those things, and what those things tell us is that our\njob is going to require some resolve and some patience over time. We’re going to have to stick\nwith this. And that’s just—we take all that as a given, but we know what our objective is, and\nwe know what our tools can do, and that’s how we think about it.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thanks. We’ll go to Nancy for the last question.\nPage 21 of 23\nNovember 2, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nNANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Hi, Chair Powell. Nancy Marshall-Genzer from\nMarketplace. I’m wondering, has the window for a soft landing narrowed? Do you still think\nit’s possible?\nCHAIR POWELL. Has it narrowed? Yes. Is it still possible? Yes. We’ve always said\nit was going to be difficult, but I think to the extent rates have to go higher and stay higher for\nlonger, it becomes harder to see the path—it’s narrowed. I would say the path has narrowed over\nthe course of the last year, really. Hard to say. Hard to say. Again, I would say that the sort of\narray of data in the labor market is highly unusual and, to many economists, there is a path to—\nordinarily there’s a relationship to GDP going down and vacancies declining, translating into\nunemployment, or there’s Okun’s law. So all those things are relationships that are in the data,\nand they’re very real. Data’s a little bit different this time, though, because you have this\ntremendously high level of vacancies and, we think, on a very steep part of the Beveridge curve.\nAll I would say is that the job losses may turn out to be less than would be indicated by those\ntraditional measures, because job openings are so elevated and because the labor market is so\nstrong. Again, that’s going to be something we discover empirically. I think no one knows\nwhether there’s going to be a recession or not and, if so, how bad that recession would be. And\nour job is to restore price stability so that we can have a strong labor market that benefits all over\ntime. And that’s what we’re going to do.\nNANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Just real quickly—why do you feel like the window\nhas narrowed?\nCHAIR POWELL. Because we haven’t seen inflation coming down. The implication of\ninflation not coming down. What we would expect by now to have seen is that as the—really, as\nthe supply-side problems have resolved themselves, we would have expected goods inflation to\nPage 22 of 23\nNovember 2, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ncome down by now, long since by now. And it really hasn’t. Actually, it has come down, but\nnot to the extent that we had hoped. At the same time, now you see services inflation, core\nservices inflation moving up, and I just think that the inflation picture has become more and\nmore challenging over the course of this year, without question. That means that we have to\nhave policy be more restrictive, and that narrows the path to a soft landing, I would say.\nThanks very much.\nPage 23 of 23"

    "statement": "For release at 2:00 p.m. EST December 14, 2022\nRecent indicators point to modest growth in spending and production. Job gains have\nbeen robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Inflation remains\nelevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and\nenergy prices, and broader price pressures.\nRussia’s war against Ukraine is causing tremendous human and economic hardship. The\nwar and related events are contributing to upward pressure on inflation and are weighing on\nglobal economic activity. The Committee is highly attentive to inflation risks.\nThe Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of\n2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to raise the\ntarget range for the federal funds rate to 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. The Committee anticipates that\nongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary\npolicy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time. In determining the\npace of future increases in the target range, the Committee will take into account the cumulative\ntightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and\ninflation, and economic and financial developments. In addition, the Committee will continue\nreducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed\nsecurities, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet\nthat were issued in May. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its\n2 percent objective.\n(more)\n-2-\nIn assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to\nmonitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee\nwould be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that\ncould impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take\ninto account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market\nconditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international\ndevelopments.\nVoting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H.

    "press_conf": "December 14, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nTranscript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference\nDecember 14, 2022\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. Before I go into the details of today’s meeting, I\nwould like to underscore for the American people that we understand the hardship that high\ninflation is causing and that we are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our\n2 percent goal. Over the course of the year, we have taken forceful actions to tighten the stance\nof monetary policy. We have covered a lot of ground, and the full effects of our rapid tightening\nso far are yet to be felt. Even so, we have more work to do. Price stability is the responsibility\nof the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy. Without price stability, the\neconomy doesn’t work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a\nsustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.\nToday, the FOMC raised our policy interest rate by ½ percentage point. We continue to\nanticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary\npolicy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time. In addition, we are\ncontinuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet. Restoring price\nstability will likely require maintaining a restrictive policy stance for some time. I will have\nmore to say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic\ndevelopments.\nThe U.S. economy has slowed significantly from last year’s rapid pace. Although real\nGDP rose at a pace of 2.9 percent last quarter, it is roughly unchanged through the first three\nquarters of this year. Recent indicators point to modest growth of spending and production this\nquarter. Growth in consumer spending has slowed from last year’s rapid pace, in part reflecting\nlower real disposable income and tighter financial conditions. Activity in the housing sector has\nweakened significantly, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates and\nPage 1 of 23\nDecember 14, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nslower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment. As shown in our\nSummary of Economic Projections, the median projection for real GDP growth stands at just\n0.5 percent this year and next, well below the median estimate of the longer-run normal\ngrowth rate.\nDespite the slowdown in growth, the labor market remains extremely tight, with the\nunemployment rate near a 50-year low, job vacancies still very high, and wage growth elevated.\nJob gains have been robust, with employment rising by an average of 272,000 jobs per month\nover the last three months. Although job vacancies have moved below their highs and the pace\nof job gains has slowed from earlier in the year, the labor market continues to be out of balance,\nwith demand substantially exceeding the supply of available workers. The labor force\nparticipation rate is little changed since the beginning of the year. FOMC participants expect\nsupply and demand conditions in the labor market to come into better balance over time, easing\nupward pressures on wages and prices. The median projection in the SEP for the unemployment\nrate rises to 4.6 percent at the end of next year.\nInflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. Over the 12 months\nending in October, total PCE prices rose 6 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy\ncategories, core PCE prices rose 5 percent. In November, the 12-month change in the CPI was\n7.1 percent, and the change in the core CPI was 6 percent. The inflation data received so far for\nOctober and November show a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of price increases. But it\nwill take substantially more evidence to give confidence that inflation is on a sustained\ndownward path. Price pressures remain evident across a broad range of goods and services.\nRussia’s war against Ukraine has boosted prices for energy and food and has contributed to\nupward pressure on inflation. The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is\nPage 2 of 23\nDecember 14, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\n5.6 percent this year and falls to 3.1 percent next year, 2.5 percent in 2024, and 2.1 percent in\n2025; participants continue to see risks to inflation as weighted to the upside.\nDespite elevated inflation, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well\nanchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters as\nwell as measures from financial markets. But that is not grounds for complacency; the longer the\ncurrent bout of high inflation continues, the greater the chance that expectations of higher\ninflation will become entrenched.\nThe Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware\nthat high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for\nthose least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We\nare highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are\nstrongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.\nAt today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by\n½ percentage point, bringing the target range to 4¼ to 4½ percent. And we are continuing the\nprocess of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet.\nWith today’s action, we have raised interest rates by 4¼ percentage points this year. We\ncontinue to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be\nappropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return\ninflation to 2 percent over time. Over the course of the year, financial conditions have tightened\nsignificantly in response to our policy actions. Financial conditions fluctuate in the short term in\nresponse to many factors, but it is important that, over time, they reflect the policy restraint that\nwe are putting in place to return inflation to 2 percent. We are seeing the effects on demand in\nPage 3 of 23\nDecember 14, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthe most interest-sensitive sectors of the economy, such as housing. It will take time, however,\nfor the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation. In light of the\ncumulative tightening of monetary policy and the lags with which monetary policy affects\neconomic activity and inflation, the Committee decided to raise interest rates by 50 basis points\ntoday, a step-down from the 75 basis point pace seen over the previous four meetings. Of\ncourse, 50 basis points is still a historically large increase, and we still have some ways to go.\nAs shown in the SEP, the median projection for the appropriate level of the federal funds\nrate is 5.1 percent at the end of next year, ½ percentage point higher than projected in September.\nThe median projection is 4.1 percent at the end of 2024 and 3.1 percent at the end of 2025, still\nabove the median estimate of its longer-run value. Of course, these projections do not represent\na Committee decision or plan, and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a\nyear or more from now. Our decisions will depend on the totality of incoming data and their\nimplications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation. And we will continue to make\nour decisions meeting by meeting and communicate our thinking as clearly as possible.\nWe are taking forceful steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better alignment\nwith supply. Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our\n2 percent goal and to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Reducing inflation\nis likely to require a sustained period of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market\nconditions. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum\nemployment and stable prices over the longer run. The historical record cautions strongly\nagainst prematurely loosening policy. We will stay the course until the job is done.\nTo conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and\nbusinesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the\nPage 4 of 23\nDecember 14, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nFed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.\nThank you. I will look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Thanks for taking my question,\nMr. Chairman. You just talked about the importance of market conditions reflecting the policy\nrestraint you put in place. Since the November meeting, the 10-year has declined by 60 basis\npoints, mortgage rates have come down, high-yield credit spreads have come in, the economy’s\naccelerated, and the stock market’s up 6 percent. Is this loosening of financial conditions a\nproblem for the Fed in its effort, and its fight, against inflation? And, if so, do you need to do\nsomething about that? And how would you do something about that? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So, as I mentioned, it is important that overall financial conditions\ncontinue to reflect the policy restraint that we’re putting in place to bring inflation down to\n2 percent. We think that financial conditions have tightened significantly in the past year. But\nour policy actions work through financial conditions. And those, in turn, affect economic\nactivity, the labor market, and inflation. So what we control is our policy moves in the\ncommunications that we make. Financial conditions both anticipate, and react to, our actions.\nI would add that our focus is not on short-term moves, but on persistent moves. And\nmany, many things, of course, move financial conditions over time. I would say it’s our\njudgment today that we’re not at a sufficiently restrictive policy stance yet, which is why we say\nthat we would expect that ongoing hikes would be appropriate. And I would point you to the\nSEP again for our current assessment of what that peak level will be. As you will have seen,\n19 people filled out the SEP this time, and 17 of those 19 wrote down a peak rate of 5 percent or\nmore—in the 5s. So that’s our best assessment today for what we think the peak rate will be.\nPage 5 of 23\nDecember 14, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nYou will also know that, at each subsequent SEP during the course of this year, we’ve\nactually increased our estimate of what that peak rate will be. And today we’re—the SEP that\nwas published shows again that, overwhelmingly, FOMC participants believe that inflation risks\nare to the upside. So I can’t tell you confidently that we won’t move up our estimate of the peak\nrate again at the next SEP. I don’t know what we’ll do. It will depend on future data. What\nwe’re writing down today is our best estimate of what we think that peak rate will be, based on\nwhat we know. Obviously, if data—if the inflation data come in worse, that could move up.\nAnd it could move down if inflation data are softer.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jeanna.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Jeanna Smialek, New York Times. Thanks for taking our\nquestions. The SEP, like you mentioned, suggests that the Fed will be making another\n¾ percentage points worth of rate increases in 2023. I wonder if you would foresee that being in\n25 basis point increments, 50 basis point increments—sort of how you see the speed playing out\ngoing forward. And then I wonder what you’re looking at as you determine when to stop.\nCHAIR POWELL. So, as I’ve been saying, as we’ve gone through the course of this\nyear, as we lifted off and got into the course of the year and we saw the—how strong inflation\nwas and how persistent, it was very important to move quickly. In fact, the speed—the pace with\nwhich we’re moving was the most important thing. I think now that we’re coming to the end of\nthis year, we’ve raised 425 basis points this year, and we’re into restrictive territory.\nIt’s now not so important how fast we go. It’s far more important to think, what is the\nultimate level? And then it’s—at a certain point, the question will become, how long do we\nremain restrictive? That will become the most important question. But I would say the most\nimportant question now is no longer the speed. So—and that applies to February as well. So I\nPage 6 of 23\nDecember 14, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthink we’ll make the February decision based on the incoming data and where we see financial\nconditions, where we see the economy. And that’ll be the key thing, but—I mean, for that\ndecision.\nBut, ultimately, that question about how high to raise rates is going to be one that we\nmake looking at our progress on inflation, looking at where financial conditions are, and making\nan assessment of whether policy is restrictive enough. [As] I’ve told you today, we have an\nassessment that we’re not at a restrictive enough stance, even with today’s move. And we’ve\nlaid out our own—our individual assessments of what we would need to do to get there. At a\ncertain point, though, we’ll get to that point. And then the question will be, how long do we\nstay there?\nAnd there, the strong view on the Committee is that we’ll need to stay there, you know,\nuntil we’re really confident that inflation is coming down in a sustained way. And we think that\nthat will be some time. Now, why do I say that? If you look at—you can break inflation down\ninto three, sort of, buckets. The first is goods inflation, and we see now, as we’ve been\nexpecting, really, for a year and a half, that supply conditions would get better. And, ultimately,\nsupply chains get fixed, and demand settles down a little bit and maybe goes back to services a\nlittle bit. And we start to see goods inflation coming down. We’re now starting to see that in\nthis report and the last one.\nThen you go to housing services. We know the story there is that housing services\ninflation has been very, very high and will continue to go up, actually. As rents expire and have\nto be renewed, they’re going to be renewed into a market where rates are higher than they were\nwhen the original leases were signed. But we see that the new leases that are—that the rate for\nnew leases is coming down. So, once we work our way through that backlog, that inflation will\nPage 7 of 23\nDecember 14, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ncome down sometime next year. The third piece, which is something like 55 percent of the\nindex, PCE core inflation index, is non-housing-related core services. And that’s really a\nfunction of the labor market, largely. The biggest cost, by far, in that sector is labor. And we do\nsee a very, very strong labor market, one where we haven’t seen much softening, where job\ngrowth is very high, where wages are very high. Vacancies are quite elevated, and, really,\nthere’s an imbalance in the labor market between supply and demand. So that part of it, which is\nthe biggest part, is likely to take a substantial period to get down.\nThe other—you know, the goods inflation has turned pretty quickly now after not turning\nat all for a year and a half. Now it seems to be turning. But there’s an expectation, really, that\nthe services inflation will not move down so quickly, so that we’ll have to stay at it, so that we\nmay have to raise rates higher to get to where we want to go. And that’s really why we are\nwriting down those high rates and why we’re expecting that they’ll have to remain high for\na time.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Howard.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Howard Schneider with Reuters. Thanks for taking the\nquestion. You describe GDP growth in the SEPs as moderate or modest, I believe. Yet it’s\nreally approaching stall speed. Half a percentage point is not much. You described labor market\nunemployment rate as representing some softening. But it’s nearly a full percentage point rise,\nand that’s well in excess of what has historically been associated with recession. Why wouldn’t\nthis be considered a recessionary projection by the Fed?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, I’ll tell you what the projection is. I don’t think it would\nqualify as a recession, though, because you’ve got positive growth. The expectations in the SEP\nare basically as you said, which is, we’ve got growth at a modest level, which is to say that\nPage 8 of 23\nDecember 14, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\n½ percentage point, that’s positive growth. It’s slow growth. It’s well below trend. It’s not\ngoing to feel like a boom. It’s going to feel like very slow growth, right?\nIn that condition, labor market conditions are softening a bit. Unemployment does go up\na bit. I would say that many analysts believe that the natural rate of unemployment is actually\nelevated at this moment. So it’s not clear that those forecasts of inflation are really much above\nthe natural rate of unemployment. We can never identify its location with great precision. But\nthat 4.7 percent is still a strong labor market.\nIf you look—you know, you’ve got—the reports we get from the field are that companies\nare very reluctant to lay people off, other than the tech companies, which is, you know, a story\nunto itself. Generally, companies want to hold onto the workers they have because it’s been\nvery, very hard to hire. So you’ve got all these vacancies out there—far in excess of the number\nof employed people. That doesn’t sound like a—you know, a labor market where a lot of people\nwill need to be put out of work. So that we—you know, there are channels through which the\nlabor market can come back into balance with relatively modest increases in unemployment, we\nbelieve. None of that is guaranteed, but that is what their forecast reflects.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nick.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Thanks. Nick Timiraos, Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, I want\nto follow up on Jeanna’s question. The decision to step down the pace of rate increase—rate\nrises appears to have been socialized at your last meeting, largely before the past two CPI reports\nshowed inflation decelerating in line with the Committee’s forecasts this year. You just now\ntalked about making decisions meeting by meeting and being mindful of the lags of policy. Does\nthat mean, all things equal, you would feel more comfortable probing where the terminal rate is\nby moving in 25 basis point increments, including beginning at your next meeting?\nPage 9 of 23\nDecember 14, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. So I haven’t made a judgment on what size rate hike to make at the\nlast meeting. But, you know, what you said is broadly right, which is, having moved so quickly\nand having now so much restraint that’s still in the pipeline, we think that the appropriate thing\nto do now is to move to a slower pace. And, you know, that will allow us to feel our way and—\nyou know, and get to that level, we think, and better balance the risks that we face. So that’s the\nidea. It makes a lot of sense, it seems to me—particularly if you consider how far we’ve come.\nBut, again, I can’t tell you today what the actual size of that will be. It will depend on a variety\nof factors, including the incoming data in particular, the state of the economy, the state of\nfinancial conditions.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. With the CPI report, if it did come out last week, do you think it\nwould have changed some of those forecasts in today’s estimate?\nCHAIR POWELL. No. Absolutely not. No. As a—just a matter of practice, the SEP\nreflects any data that’s—that comes out during the meeting. And participants know that they\nhave the—they know this—that they can make changes to their SEP during the meeting, you\nknow, well in advance of the press conference so that we’re not running around. But that’s not\nthe case. It’s never the case that the SEPs don’t reflect an important piece of data that came in\non the first day of the meeting.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Rachel.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Hi, Chair Powell. Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. Thank\nyou for taking our questions. I’m wondering if we could talk about the projection for the\nunemployment rate. Why has the Fed raised its unemployment projection? Is it because the\nmodel suggests that a higher terminal rate would automatically cause a higher unemployment\nPage 10 of 23\nDecember 14, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nrate? Or are you seeing signs that the labor market isn’t quite as strong as we think it is now?\nThanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. No. It’s not about the strength of the labor market. The labor market\nis clearly very strong. It is more just that, you know, by now, we had expected—we’ve\ncontinually expected to make faster progress on inflation than we have, ultimately. And that’s\nwhy the peak rate for this year goes up between this meeting and the September meeting. You\nsee that—you see the fact that we’ve made less progress than expected on inflation. So that’s\nwhy that goes up. And that’s why unemployment goes up, because we’re having to tighten\npolicy more. And so it didn’t go up by much in the meeting, I don’t think. But that’s the idea, is\nslower progress on inflation, tighter policy, probably higher rates probably held for longer just to\nget to where you—the kind of restriction that you need to get inflation down to 2 percent.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Do you have a sense of, in order to get to that number, how much of\nthat could be caused by layoffs versus vacancies, trimming, or changes to the labor force\npopulation rate?\nCHAIR POWELL. It’s very hard to say. You know, there—you can look at history,\nright? And history would, you know, would say that, in a situation like this, the declines in\nunemployment would be more meaningful, I think, than what you see written down there. But\nwhy do we think that is the case? So, I’ll give you a few reasons. First just is that there’s this\nhuge overhang of vacancies, meaning that vacancies can come down a fair amount. And we’re\nhearing from many companies that they don’t want to lay people off—so that they’ll keep people\nbecause it’s been so hard.\nI mean, I think we’ve—it feels like we have a structural labor shortage out there where\nthere are, you know, 4 million fewer people, a little more than 4 million who were in the\nPage 11 of 23\nDecember 14, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nworkforce available to work than there’s demand for workforce. So the fact that there’s a strong\nlabor market, you know, means that companies will hold on to workers. And it means that it\nmay take longer, but it also means that the costs in unemployment may be less. Again, that\nwe’re going to find out empirically. But I think that’s a reasonably possible outcome. And you\ndo hear, you know, many, many labor economists believe that it is. So we’ll see, though.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Colby.\nCOLBY SMITH. Thank you. Colby Smith with the Financial Times. How should we\ninterpret the higher core inflation forecast for 2023 in the SEP? Does that not then suggest that\nthe policy rate currently forecasted for next year should actually be higher than the 5.1 median\nestimate penciled in?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, I think that’s why one of the reasons it went up was that core\ncame in stronger this year. Yeah. What you see is our best estimate, as of today—really, as of\ntoday—for how high we need to raise rates to—how much we need to tighten policy to create\nenough, you know, restrictive policy to slow economic activity and slow—soften the labor\nmarket and bring inflation down through those channels. That’s all—that is the estimate—best\nestimate—we make today. And, as I mentioned, we’ll make another estimate for the next SEP.\nAnd we’ll, you know, of course, between meetings, we do the same thing, but we don’t\npublish it.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi. Victoria Guida with Politico. I wanted to make sure I\nunderstand specifically what’s going on in the SEP, because you all expect rates to go higher, but\nyou’re also more pessimistic about what inflation is going to look like next year. And I was just\nPage 12 of 23\nDecember 14, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nwondering, you know, given that we have seen some cooling in inflation, you know, is it—is that\nprimarily because of wage growth, that you expect wage growth to be sort of a headwind?\nCHAIR POWELL. We’re going into next year with higher inflation than we had\nthought, right? So we’re actually moving down to—the level that we’re moving down to next\nyear is still a very large drop in inflation from where inflation is running now, well more than\n1 percent change in inflation. But remember that the jump[ing]-off point at the beginning of the\nyear is higher. So, you know, we—we’re moving down still by a very large chunk. I don’t think\nit’s having—I don’t think the policy is having any less effect. It’s just starting from a higher\nlevel at the end of 2022. So we’re getting down. I believe the median is 3½ percent. That\nwould be—that’s a pretty significant drop in inflation.\nAnd, you know, where’s it coming from? It’s coming from the goods sector, clearly. By\nthe middle of next year, we should begin to see lower inflation from the housing services sector.\nAnd then, you know, the big question is, when we—how much will you see from the largest, the\n55 percent of the index, which is the non-housing services sector? And, you know, that’s where\nyou need to see—we believe you need to see a better balancing of supply and demand in the\nlabor market so that you have—it’s not that we don’t want wage increases. We want strong\nwage increases. We just want them to be at a level that’s consistent with 2 percent inflation.\nRight now that—if you put into—if you factor in productivity estimates, standard productivity\nestimates, wages are running, you know, well above what would be consistent with 2 percent\ninflation.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Neil.\nNEIL IRWIN. Thanks. Hi, Chair Powell. Neil Irwin with Axios. Some of your\ncolleagues have been pretty explicit that they can’t imagine rate cuts happening in 2023. That’s\nPage 13 of 23\nDecember 14, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ncertainly not implied by the SEP. But futures markets have priced in some easing in the back\nhalf of next year. What’s your view of the likelihood of any kind of rate cuts next year? What\ncircumstances might make that plausible?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, our focus right now is really on moving our policy stance\nto one that is restrictive enough to ensure a return of inflation to our 2 percent goal over time.\nIt’s not on rate cuts. And we think that we’ll have to maintain a restrictive stance of policy for\nsome time. Historical experience cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy. I\nguess I would say it this way: I wouldn’t see us considering rate cuts until the Committee is\nconfident that inflation is moving down to 2 percent in a sustained way. So that’s the test I\nwould articulate. And you’re correct. There are not rate cuts in the SEP for 2023.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve.\nSTEVE MATTHEWS. Steve Matthews with Bloomberg. Let me ask you about China.\nIn the last few weeks, China has abandoned its COVID policy and been reopening pretty\nstrongly. I’m wondering if you see that as disinflationary because you’re seeing supply chains\nimprove or inflationary because it obviously brings a lot more demand globally, improves the\nglobal outlook for growth and for commodities prices.\nCHAIR POWELL. So you’re right. Those two things will offset each other. Weaker\noutput in China will push down on commodity prices, but it could interfere with supply chains\nultimately. And that could push inflation up in the West. It’s very hard to say, you know, how\nmuch—how those two will offset each other. And it doesn’t seem likely, actually, that the\noverall net effect would be material on us. But, to your point, China faces a very challenging\nsituation in reopening. You know, we’ve seen, waves of COVID all around the world can\ninterfere with economic activity. China, a very critical manufacturing—place for manufacturing\nPage 14 of 23\nDecember 14, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nand exporting. Their supply chain is very important. And China faces a reopening. They’ve—\nyou know, they’ve backed away from their COVID restriction policies. There could be very\nsignificant increases in COVID. And we’ll just have to see. It’s a risky situation. It—but,\nagain, it doesn’t seem like it’s likely to have material overall effects on us.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Chris.\nCHRIS RUGABER. Hi. Chris Rugaber, Associated Press. Thank you for taking my\nquestion. I wondered if you could comment a bit more about yesterday’s inflation report. I\nmean, it showed inflation cooling in all three of the categories that you laid out at Brookings.\nAre you starting to see—are you confident that you’re seeing real progress on getting inflation\nunder control? Are you still worried it could slip into some kind of unentrenched, you know,\nupward spiral? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Right. So the data that we’ve received so far for October and\nNovember, we don’t have the—some of the—we have some remaining data to get in November,\nbut they clearly do show a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of price increases. As I\nmentioned in my opening statement, it will take substantially more evidence to give confidence\nthat inflation is on a sustained downward path. So the way we think about this is this: This\nreport is very much in line with what we’ve been expecting and hoping for. And what it does is,\nit provides greater confidence in our forecast of declining inflation.\nAs I mentioned, we’ve been expecting significant—forecasting significant declines in\noverall inflation and core inflation in the coming year. And this is the kind of reading that it will\ntake to support that. So, really, this gives us greater confidence in our forecasts rather than, at\nthis point, changing our forecast. In terms of the pieces, we have been expecting goods inflation\nto come down as supply chain pressures eased. That’s happening now. Housing services—as I\nPage 15 of 23\nDecember 14, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nmentioned, there’s good news in the pipeline. As long as housing—new housing leases show\ndeclining inflation, that will show up in the measure around the middle of next year. So that\nshould help. And the big piece, again, is core services, ex housing, which is very important.\nAnd we have a ways to go there. You do see some beginning signs there.\nBut, ultimately, that’s the big—the more than half, as I mentioned, of PCE core index.\nAnd it’s very fundamentally about the labor market and wages. If you look at wages, look at the\naverage hourly earnings number we got with the last payrolls report, you don’t really see much\nprogress in terms of average hourly earnings coming down. Now, there may be composition\neffects and other effects in that. So we don’t put too much weight on any one report. These\nthings can be volatile month to month. But we will be looking for wages moving, you know,\ndown to more normal levels where workers are doing well and, ultimately, their gains are not\nbeing eaten up by inflation.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Michael McKee.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. There’s a—excuse me, Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio\nand Television. There’s a little bit of a disconnect between the optimistic view you just\nexpressed about the economy and the changes that you’ve made in the SEP. And I’m wondering\nif you’re reacting to the fact that the markets have loosened financial conditions or if you feel the\nFed may be a little bit behind on inflation, whether the recent disinflation we’re seeing is\ntransitory or not, and how this affects the idea of a soft landing if you’re projecting just\n½ percent growth for this year.\nCHAIR POWELL. So if I—I think I got your question. So, you know, one thing is to\nsay is, I think our policy’s in—getting into a pretty good place now. We’re restrictive, and I\nthink we’re—you know, we’re getting close to that level of sufficient—we think—sufficiently\nPage 16 of 23\nDecember 14, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nrestrictive. We laid out today what our best estimates are to get there. And, I mean, it boils\ndown to, how long do we think this process is going to take? And, of course, we’re—we\nwelcome these better inflation reports for the last two months. They’re very welcome. But I\nthink we’re realistic about the broader project. So that’s all. That’s the point I would make.\nIt’s—you know, we see goods prices coming down. We understand what will happen\nwith housing services. But the big story will really be the rest of it, and there’s not much\nprogress there. And that’s going to take some time. I think my view and my colleagues’ view is\nthat this will take some time. We’ll have to hold policy at a restrictive level for a sustained\nperiod so that, you know, two good—you know, two good monthly reports are, you know, very\nwelcome. Of course, they’re very welcome. But we need to be honest with ourselves that\nthere’s, you know, inflation—12-month core inflation is 6 percent CPI. That’s three times our\n2 percent target. Now, it’s good to see progress. But let’s just understand we have a long ways\nto go to get back to price stability.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Well, do you think the soft landing is no longer achievable?\nCHAIR POWELL. No, I wouldn’t say that. No. I don’t say that. I mean, I would say\nthis: You know, to the extent we need to keep rates higher and keep them there for longer and\ninflation, you know, moves up higher and higher, I think that narrows the runway. But lower\ninflation readings, if they persist, in time, could certainly make it more possible. So I just—I\ndon’t think anyone knows whether we’re going to have a recession or not and, if we do, whether\nit’s going to be a deep one or not. It’s just, it’s not knowable. And certainly, you know, lower\ninflation reports, were they to continue for a period of time, would increase the likelihood of a—\nput it this way, of a return to price stability that involves significantly less of an increase in\nunemployment than would be expected given the historical record.\nPage 17 of 23\nDecember 14, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMICHELLE SMITH. Brian.\nBRIAN CHEUNG. Hi, Chairman Powell. Brian Cheung, NBC News. You warned\nAmericans of pain earlier this year as the Fed hikes rates. But with the Fed now expected to\nraise rates higher than you thought when you first said that, just wondering where we are in that\npain. How would you describe that to Americans if the projections on unemployment find\nthemselves—that’d be 1.6 million Americans out of jobs?\nCHAIR POWELL. So the largest amount of pain—the worst pain would come from a\nfailure to raise rates high enough and from us allowing inflation to become entrenched in the\neconomy so that the ultimate cost of getting it out of the economy would be very high in terms of\nemployment, meaning very high unemployment for extended periods of time, the kind of thing\nthat had to happen when inflation really got out of control and the Fed didn’t respond\naggressively enough or soon enough in a prior episode, you know, 50 years ago. So that’s\nreally—the worst pain would be if we failed to act.\nWhat we’re doing now is, you know, it’s raising interest rates for people. And so people\nare paying higher rates on mortgages and that kind of thing. There will be some softening in\nlabor market conditions. And I wish there were a completely painless way to restore price\nstability. There isn’t. And this is the best we can do. I do think, though, that—and markets are\npretty confident, it seems to me—that we will get inflation under control. And I believe we will.\nWe’re certainly highly committed to do that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Grady.\nGRADY TRIMBLE. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Grady Trimble with Fox Business. You’ve\nreiterated today and the Committee has reiterated its commitment to that 2 percent inflation\nPage 18 of 23\nDecember 14, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ntarget. I wonder, is there ever a point where you actually reevaluate that target and maybe\nincrease your inflation target if it is stickier than even you think it is?\nCHAIR POWELL. That’s just—so, changing our inflation goal is just something we’re\nnot thinking about, and it’s something we’re not going to think about. It’s—we have a 2 percent\ninflation goal, and we’ll use our tools to get inflation back to 2 percent. I think this isn’t the time\nto be thinking about that. I mean, there may be a longer-run project at some point. But that is\nnot where we are at all. The Committee—we’re not considering that. We’re not going to\nconsider that under any circumstances. We’re going to keep our inflation target at 2 percent.\nWe’re going to use our tools to get inflation back to 2 percent.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nicole.\nNICOLE GOODKIND. Thank you, Chairman Powell. Nicole Goodkind, CNN\nBusiness. As you monitor wage growth and unemployment data, I wonder if you’re paying close\nattention to a sector or even income level? Like, how do you factor potential exacerbations of\ninequality into your risk calculations, especially given the K-shaped recovery of 2020?\nCHAIR POWELL. So the—I would go back to the labor market that we had in 2018,\n’19, ’20. So, what that looked like was, wage increases for the people at the lowest end of the\nincome spectrum were the largest. The gaps between racial groups and gender groups were at\ntheir smallest in recorded history. That’s—and all of that because of a tight labor market, a tight\nlabor market which had inflation running, you know, just a tick below 2 percent and the\neconomy growing right at its potential.\nSo that seems like something that would be really good for the economy and for the\ncountry, if we could get back to that. And so that’s what all of us want to do. We want to get\nback to a long expansion where the labor market can remain strong over an extended period of\nPage 19 of 23\nDecember 14, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ntime. That’s a really good thing for workers in the economy. And we’d love to get back to that.\nThat’s what our goal is. You know, there’s—in the near term, we have to use our tools to restore\nprice stability. But we, you know, we can’t—what we have to think about is the medium and\nlonger term.\nIf you think about it, the country went through a difficult time—I think much more\ndifficult than we can think it would happen here. But it really set up our economy for several\ndecades of prosperity. So price stability is something that really pays dividends for the benefit of\nthe economy and the people in it over a very, very long period of time. And so when it is lost,\nfor whatever reason, it has to be restored and as quickly as possible—which is what we’re doing.\nNICOLE GOODKIND. In the short term, are you factoring in these exacerbations or\npotential exacerbations in the economy? Are you monitoring them?\nCHAIR POWELL. We do, yes. We absolutely do. We look at—it’s our regular practice\nto talk about unemployment rates by different groups, including racial groups and that sort of\nthing. We do. We keep our eye on that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nancy.\nNANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Hi. Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace. What\nwould you do if the economy slows so much that we enter a recession before we see strong\nconsistent signs that inflation is slowing—in other words, stagflation?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I don’t want to get into too many hypotheticals. But, you know,\nwe’ll—it’s hard to deal with hypotheticals. So let me just say that we have to use our tools to\nsupport maximum employment and price stability. I’ve made it clear that right now, the labor\nmarket’s very, very strong. You’re near a 50-year low where you’re at or above maximum\nemployment, a 50-year low in unemployment, vacancies are very high, wages—nominal wages\nPage 20 of 23\nDecember 14, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nare very high. So the labor market’s very, very strong. Where we’re missing is on the inflation\nside. And we’re missing by a lot on the inflation side. So that means we need to really focus on\ngetting inflation under control, and that’s what we’ll do. I think, as the economy heals, the two\ngoals come more into play. But right now, clearly, the focus has to be on getting inflation down.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Greg.\nGREG ROBB. Thank you, Chairman Powell. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. You\nspoke a little bit ago. You said that the U.S. looks—it looks like we have a structural labor\nshortage in the economy. Could you expand on that, talk a little bit more about that? And,\nreally, are you talking about getting Congress action on increasing, like, legal immigration,\nthings like that? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So, what I meant by that, with “structural labor shortage,” is, if you\nlook at where we are now, as I mentioned, there—if you just look at demand for labor, you can\nlook at vacancies plus people who are actually working. And then you can take supply of labor\nby, “Are you in the labor market?” “Are you looking for a job or have a job?” And you’re 4—\nmore than 4 million people short. We don’t see—despite very high wages and an incredibly\ntight labor market, we don’t see participation moving up—which is contrary to what we thought.\nSo the upshot of all that is, the labor market is actually—it should—it’s 3½ million\npeople, at least, smaller than it should have been based on pre-pandemic. Just assume population\nand reasonable growth and aging of the population; our labor force should be 3½ million more\nthan it is. And that—there’re lots of easy ways to get to bigger numbers than that if you go back\na few more years. So why is that? Part of it is just accelerated retirements. People dropped out\nand aren’t coming back at a higher rate than expected. Part of it is that we lost a half a million\nPage 21 of 23\nDecember 14, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\npeople who would have been work—close to half a million who would have been working died\nfrom COVID. And part of it is that migration has been lower.\nWe don’t prescribe—you know, it’s not our job to prescribe things. But, you know, I\nthink if you ask businesses, you know, pretty much everybody you talk to says there aren’t\nenough people. We need more people. So I tried to identify that in my—in a speech I gave a\nmonth ago, but I stopped short of telling Congress what to do because, you know, they gave us a\njob. And we need to, you know, do that job.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thanks. Jennifer.\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. Thank you, Chair Powell. Jennifer Schonberger with\nYahoo Finance. You say you expect growth of just ½ percent next year. Given that you’ve said\nthe process of raising rates and getting inflation back under control will be painful, have you had\ndiscussions within the Committee and addressed how long and/or how deep of a recession you\nwould be willing to accept?\nCHAIR POWELL. No. I mean, what we do is, we make our forecasts, and we publish\nthem quarterly. And, you know, if you look at those forecasts, those are forecasts for slow\ngrowth, for a softening labor market, by which I mean, unemployment goes up but not a great\ndeal. And you see inflation coming down. You see rates going up a lot. You see inflation\ncoming down. Those are those forecasts, and that’s really what they show.\nWe’re not—of course, we don’t talk about, you know, this kind of a recession and that\nkind of a recession. We just, you know, we make those forecasts. The staff runs—and you will\nsee this if you look at the old Tealbooks—runs alternative simulations of all different kinds at\nevery meeting, and we look at those, too. And those will explore different things. But that’s\njust, you know, upside and downside scenarios. Of course, that’s a responsible practice that\nPage 22 of 23\nDecember 14, 2022 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nwe’ve carried on for many decades. But, no, we don’t—we haven’t asked ourselves that\nquestion.\nMICHELLE SMITH. We’ll go to Jean for the last question.\nJEAN YUNG. Hi. Jean Yung with Market News. I wanted to ask about the SEP again.\nIf you’re reaching peak rates around 5 percent in the first half of next year and inflation starts to\ndecline materially, that would seem to make the real rate gradually more restrictive. Is that\nsomething that’s built into the projections and into models? Is that something you would want\nto see?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we do know that. Of course, that’s something that we know we’d\nsee. But, as I mentioned, you know, we wouldn’t—I wouldn’t see the Committee cutting rates\nuntil we’re confident that inflation is moving down in a sustained way. That would be my test. I\ndon’t see us as having a really clear and precise understanding of what the neutral rate is and\nwhat real rates are so that it would mechanically happen like that. It would—really, it’ll be a test\nof—for cutting rates, I think, in the event, it’ll be a question of, do we actually feel confident that\ninflation is coming down in a sustained way?\nThank you very much.\nPage 23 of 23"

    "press_conf": "February 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nTranscript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference\nFebruary 1, 2023\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon, and welcome. My colleagues and I understand the\nhardship that high inflation is causing, and we are strongly committed to bringing inflation back\ndown to our 2 percent goal. Over the past year, we have taken forceful actions to tighten the\nstance of monetary policy. We have covered a lot of ground, and the full effects of our rapid\ntightening so far are yet to be felt. Even so, we have more work to do. Price stability is the\nresponsibility of the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy. Without price\nstability, the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will\nnot achieve a sustained period of labor market conditions that benefit all.\nToday, the FOMC raised our policy interest rate by 25 basis points. We continue to\nanticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary\npolicy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time. In addition, we are\ncontinuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet. Restoring price\nstability will likely require maintaining a restrictive stance for some time. I will have more to\nsay about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments.\nThe U.S. economy slowed significantly last year, with real GDP rising at a below-trend\npace of 1 percent. Recent indicators point to modest growth of spending and production this\nquarter. Consumer spending appears to be expanding at a subdued pace, in part reflecting tighter\nfinancial conditions over the past year. Activity in the housing sector continues to weaken,\nlargely reflecting higher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates and slower output growth also\nappear to be weighing on business fixed investment.\nDespite the slowdown in growth, the labor market remains extremely tight, with the\nunemployment rate at a 50-year low, job vacancies still very high, and wage growth elevated.\nPage 1 of 23\nFebruary 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nJob gains have been robust, with employment rising by an average of 247,000 jobs per month\nover the last three months. Although the pace of job gains has slowed over the course of the past\nyear and nominal wage growth has shown some signs of easing, the labor market continues to be\nout of balance. Labor demand substantially exceeds the supply of available workers, and the\nlabor force participation rate has changed little from a year ago.\nInflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. Over the 12 months\nending in December, total PCE prices rose 5.0 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy\ncategories, core PCE prices rose 4.4 percent. The inflation data received over the past three\nmonths show a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of increases. And, while recent\ndevelopments are encouraging, we will need substantially more evidence to be confident that\ninflation is on a sustained downward path.\nDespite elevated inflation, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well\nanchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as\nwell as measures from financial markets. But that’s not grounds for complacency. Although\ninflation has moderated recently, it remains too high. The longer the current bout of high\ninflation continues, the greater the chance that expectations of higher inflation will become\nentrenched.\nThe Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware\nthat high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for\nthose least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We\nare highly attentive to the risks that inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are\nstrongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.\nPage 2 of 23\nFebruary 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nAt today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by\n25 basis points, bringing the target range to 4½ to 4¾ percent. And we are continuing the\nprocess of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet.\nWith today’s action, we have raised interest rates by 4½ percentage points over the past\nyear. We continue to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds\nrate will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently\nrestrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.\nWe are seeing the effects of our policy actions on demand in the most interest-sensitive\nsectors of the economy, particularly housing. It will take time, however, for the full effects of\nmonetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation. In light of the cumulative tightening of\nmonetary policy and the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation,\nthe Committee decided to raise interest rates by 25 basis points today, continuing the step-down\nfrom last year’s rapid pace of increases. Shifting to a slower pace will better allow the\nCommittee to assess the economy’s progress toward our goals as we determine the extent of\nfuture increases that will be required to attain a sufficiently restrictive stance. We will continue\nto make our decisions meeting by meeting, taking into account the totality of incoming data and\ntheir implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation.\nWe have been taking forceful steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better\nalignment with supply. Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to\nour 2 percent goal and to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Reducing\ninflation is likely to require a period of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market\nconditions. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum\nPage 3 of 23\nFebruary 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nemployment and stable prices over the longer run. The historical record cautions strongly\nagainst prematurely loosening policy. We will stay the course, until the job is done.\nTo conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses\nacross the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do\neverything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals. Thank you,\nand I look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Chris.\nCHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Chris Rugaber, the Associated Press. Thank you for\ndoing this. As you know, financial conditions have loosened since the fall with bond yields\nfalling, which has also brought down mortgage rates, and the stock market posted a solid gain in\nJanuary. Does that make your job of combating inflation harder? And could you see lifting rates\nhigher than you otherwise would to offset the increase in—or to offset the easing of financial\nconditions?\nCHAIR POWELL. So it is important that overall financial conditions continue to reflect\nthe policy restraint that we’re putting in place in order to bring inflation down to 2 percent. And,\nof course, financial conditions have tightened very significantly over the past year. I would say\nthat our focus is not on short-term moves but on sustained changes to broader financial\nconditions. And it is our judgment that we’re not yet at a sufficiently restrictive policy stance,\nwhich is why we say that we expect ongoing hikes will be appropriate. Of course, many things\naffect financial conditions—not just our policy. And we will take into account overall financial\nconditions along with many other factors as we set policy.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Rachel.\nPage 4 of 23\nFebruary 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Hi, Chair Powell, thank you for taking our questions. Rachel Siegel\nfrom the Washington Post. Over the last quarter, we’ve seen a deceleration in prices, in wages,\nand a fall in consumer spending, all while the unemployment rate has been able to stay at a\nhistoric low. Does this, at all, change your view of how much the unemployment rate would\nneed to go up, if at all, to see inflation come down to the levels you’re looking for?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I would say it is a good thing that the disinflation that we have\nseen so far has not come at the expense of a weaker labor market. But I would also say that that\ndisinflationary process that you now see under way is really at an early stage. What you see is,\nreally, in the goods sector you see inflation now coming down because supply chains have been\nfixed, demand is shifting back to services, and shortages have been abated. So you see that. In\nthe other—in the housing services sector, we expect inflation to continue moving up for a while\nbut then to come down, assuming that [rent increases associated with] new leases continue to be\nlower. So, in those two sectors, you’ve got a good story. The issue is that we have a large sector\ncalled nonhousing service—core nonhousing services, where we don’t see disinflation yet. But I\nwould say that, so far, what we see is progress but without any weakening in labor market\nconditions.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Has your—I’m sorry.\nCHAIR POWELL. Go ahead.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Has your expectation for where the unemployment rate might go\nchanged since December?\nCHAIR POWELL. No. We’re going to write down new forecasts at the March meeting,\nand we’ll see at that time. I will say that it is gratifying to see the disinflationary process now\nPage 5 of 23\nFebruary 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ngetting under way, and we continue to get strong labor market data. So—but, you know, we’ll\nupdate those forecasts in March.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Neil.\nNEIL IRWIN. Hi, Chair Powell. Neil Irwin with Axios. You and some of your\ncolleagues have emphasized the possibility that job openings could come down and that would\nlet some of the air out of the labor market without major job losses. We saw the opposite in the\nDecember JOLTS this morning. Job openings are actually rising. That also coincided with\nslowdown in wage inflation. Do you believe that openings are an important indicator to be\nstudying to understand where the labor market is and where wage inflation might be heading?\nCHAIR POWELL. So you’re right about the data, of course. What we did see—we’ve\nseen average hourly earnings and now the employment cost index abating a little bit still off of\ntheir highs of six months ago and more but still at levels that are fairly elevated. The job\nopenings number has—in JOLTS, has been quite volatile recently. Yeah, I did see that it moved\nup—back up this morning. I do think that it’s probably an important indicator. The ratio, I\nguess, is back up to 1.9 job openings to unemployed people, people who are looking for work.\nSo it’s an indicator, but nonetheless, we—you’re right, we do see wages moving down. If you\nlook across the rest of the labor market, you still see very high payroll job creation. And, you\nknow, quits are still at an elevated level. So many, many—by many, many indicators, the job\nmarket is still very strong.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Colby, and then Howard.\nCOLBY SMITH. Thank you. Colby Smith with the Financial Times. Given the\neconomic data since the December meeting, is the trajectory for the fed funds rate in the most\nPage 6 of 23\nFebruary 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nrecent SEP still the best guidepost for the policy path forward? Or does ongoing now mean more\nthan two rate rises now?\nCHAIR POWELL. So you’re right. At the December meeting, we all wrote down our\nbest estimates of what we thought the ultimate level would be, and that’s obviously back in\nDecember. And the median for that was between 5 and 5¼ percent. At the March meeting,\nwe’re going to update those assessments. We did not update them today. We did, however,\ncontinue to say that we believe ongoing rate hikes will be appropriate to attain a sufficiently\nrestrictive stance of policy to bring inflation back down to 2 percent. We think we’ve covered a\nlot of ground, and financial conditions have certainly tightened. I would say we still think\nthere’s work to do there. We haven’t made a decision on exactly where that will be. I think, you\nknow, we’re going to be looking carefully at the incoming data between now and the March\nmeeting and then the May meeting. I don’t feel a lot of certainty about where that will be. It\ncould certainly be higher than we’re writing down right now. If we come to the view that we\nneed to write down to, you know, to move rates up beyond what we said in December, we would\ncertainly do that. At the same time, if the data come in, in the other direction, then we’ll, you\nknow, we’ll make data-dependent decisions at coming meetings, of course.\nCOLBY SMITH. Just as a quick follow-up, how are you viewing the kind of balance of\nrisk between those two options of, you know, the likelihood of maybe falling short of that or\ngoing beyond that level?\nCHAIR POWELL. I guess I would say it this way. I continue to think that it’s very\ndifficult to manage the risk of doing too little and finding out in 6 or 12 months that we actually\nwere close but didn’t get the job done. Inflation springs back, and we have to go back in. And\nnow, you really do worry about expectations getting unanchored and that kind of thing. This is a\nPage 7 of 23\nFebruary 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nvery difficult risk to manage, whereas I—of course, we have no incentive and no desire to\novertighten. But we, you know, if we feel like we’ve gone too far, we can certainly—and\ninflation is coming down faster than we expect, then we have tools that would work on that. So I\ndo think that, in this situation, where we have still the highest inflation in 40 years, you know,\nthe job is not fully done. As I started to mention earlier, we have a sector that represents\n56 percent of the core inflation index where we don’t see disinflation yet. So we don’t see it.\nIt’s not happening yet. Inflation in the core services ex. housing is still running at 4 percent on a\n6- and 12-month basis. So there’s not—nothing happening there. In the other two sectors\nrepresenting, you know, less than 50 percent, you actually, I think, now have a story that is\ncredible, that’s coming together, although you don’t actually see disinflation yet in housing\nservices, but it’s in the pipeline, right? So, for the third sector, we don’t see anything here. So I\nthink it would be premature—it would be very premature to declare victory or to think that\nwe’ve really got this. We need to see—our goal, of course, is to bring inflation down. And how\ndo we get that done? There are many, many factors driving inflation in that sector, and they\nshould be coming into play to have inflation—the disinflationary process begin in that sector.\nBut, so far, we don’t see that. And I think until we do, we see ourselves as having a lot of work\nleft to do.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Howard.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Hi, Howard Schneider with Reuters, and thanks as usual. So\nI just wanted to connect a couple of dots here. The statement made a number of changes that\nseem to be saying things are getting better. You’re saying inflation has eased That’s new.\nYou’ve taken out references to the war in Ukraine that’s causing price increases. You’ve taken\nout references to the pandemic. You’ve eliminated all the reasons that you said prices were\nPage 8 of 23\nFebruary 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nbeing driven higher, yet that’s not mapping to any change in how you describe policy. We still\nhave ongoing increases to come. So I’m wondering, why is that the case? And does it have\nmore to do with uncertainty around the outlook or more to do with you not wanting to give a\nvery overeager market a reason to get ahead of itself and overreact?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I guess I would say it this way. We can now say, I think, for the\nfirst time that the disinflationary process has started. We can see that. And we see it, really, in\ngoods prices so far. Goods prices is a big sector. We—this is what we thought would happen\nsince the very beginning, and now here it is actually happening, and for the reasons we thought.\nWe—you know, it’s supply chains, it’s shortages, and it’s demand revolving back towards\nservices. So this is a good thing. This is a good thing. But that’s, you know, around a quarter of\nthe PCE price index—core PCE price index. So the second sector is housing services, and that’s\ndriven by very different things. And we—as I mentioned, with housing services, we expect, and\nother forecasters expect, that measured inflation will continue moving up for several months but\nwill then come down, assuming that [rent increases associated with] new leases continue to be\nsoft. And we do assume that. So we think that that’s sort of in the pipeline. And we actually see\ndisinflation in the goods sector, and we see it in the pipeline for two sectors that amount to a little\nless than half. So this is good. And we note that when we say inflation is coming down that this\nis good. We expect to see that that disinflation process will be seen, we hope soon, in the core\ngoods ex. housing—sorry, the core services ex. housing sector that I talked about. We don’t see\nit yet. It’s—you know, it’s seven or eight different kinds of services, not all of them are the\nsame. And, you know, we have a sense of what’s going on in each of those different\nsubsections. Probably the biggest part of it, probably 60 percent of that is, you know, research\nwould show is sensitive to slack in the economy and so the labor market will probably be\nPage 9 of 23\nFebruary 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nimportant. Some of the other ones it’s—the labor market is not going to be important. Many\nother factors will drive it. In any case, we don’t see disinflation in that sector yet. And I think\nwe need to see that it’s the majority of the core PCE index, which is the thing that we think is the\nbest predictor of headline PCE, which is [the price series that we associate with] our mandate.\nSo it’s not that we’re not—we’re neither optimistic nor pessimistic. We’re just telling you that\nwe don’t see inflation moving down yet in that large sector. I think we will fairly soon, but we\ndon’t see it yet. Until we do, I think we—you know, we see ourselves, we’ve got to be honest\nwith ourselves, but we see ourselves as having perhaps more persistent—we’ll see more\npersistent inflation in that sector, which will take longer to get down. And we’re just going to\nhave to—we have to complete the job. You know, that’s what we’re here for.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nick.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, you observed\nseveral years ago that we learned we can have a low unemployment rate without above-target\ninflation. And we have learned lately that inflation can come down from its uncomfortably high\nlevel despite a historically low unemployment rate. Given that, and given how much you did\nover the last year, why do you think further rate increases are needed? Why not stop here and\nsee what transpires in the coming months before raising rates again?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we’ve—you know, we’ve raised rates 4½ percentage points, and\nwe’re talking about a couple of more rate hikes to get to that level we think is appropriately\nrestrictive. And why do we think that’s probably necessary? We think, because inflation is still\nrunning very hot. We’re, of course, taking into account long and variable lags, and we’re\nthinking about that. It really—the story we’re telling about inflation is to ourselves, and the way\nwe understand it is basically the three things that I’ve just gone through a couple of times. And,\nPage 10 of 23\nFebruary 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nagain, we don’t see it affecting the services sector ex. housing yet. But, I mean, I think our\nassessment is that we’re not very far from that level. We don’t know that, though. We don’t\nknow that. So I think we’re—you know, we’re living in a world of significant uncertainty. I\nwould look across the rate—the spectrum of rates and see that real rates are now positive by—\nyou know, by an appropriate set of measures are positive across the yield curve. I think policy is\nrestrictive. We’re trying to make a fine judgment about how much is restrictive enough. That’s\nall. And we’re going to—you know, that’s why we’re slowing down to 25 basis points. We’re\ngoing to be carefully watching the economy and watching inflation and watching the progress of\nthe disinflationary process.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Did you or your colleagues discuss the conditions for a pause at this\nmeeting this week?\nCHAIR POWELL. We—you know, you’ll see that the minutes will come out in three\nweeks, and we’ll give you a lot of detail. I—you know, we spend a lot of time talking about the\npath ahead and the state of the economy. And I wouldn’t want to start to drive the—describe all\nthe details there, but that was the sense of the discussion, was really talking quite a bit about the\npath forward.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Chair Powell. I wanted to ask about the debt ceiling. Given\nthat we’ve now hit up against it, I was wondering if the U.S. goes past the X date, will the Fed do\nwhatever the Treasury directs as it relates to making payments as the fiscal agent or will it do its\nown analysis of any legal constraints?\nCHAIR POWELL. So your question is, would we—say your question again.\nPage 11 of 23\nFebruary 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Will the Fed do what Treasury directs as it relates to making\npayments or will it do its own analysis of any legal constraints?\nCHAIR POWELL. So you’re really asking about—you’re asking about prioritization, in\neffect, is what—\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Yes. Yes.\nCHAIR POWELL. Okay. So I feel like I have to say this. There’s only one way\nforward here, and that is for Congress to raise the debt ceiling so that the United States\ngovernment can pay all of its obligations when due. And any deviations from that path would be\nhighly risky and that no one should assume that the Fed can protect the economy from the\nconsequences of failing to act in a timely manner.\nIn terms of our relationship with the Treasury, we are their fiscal agent. And I’m just\ngoing to leave it at that.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Are you actively doing any planning of what might happen in the\nevent that that would happen?\nCHAIR POWELL. I’m just going to leave it at that. This is a matter that’s to be\nresolved between, really—it’s really Congress’ job to raise the debt ceiling. And I gather there\nare discussions happening, but they don’t involve us. We’re not involved in those discussions.\nSo we’re the fiscal agent.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jeanna and then Steve.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times. Thanks for taking our\nquestions. I wonder, was there any discussion today of the possibility of pausing rate increases\nand then restarting them? Lorie Logan from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas seemed to\nPage 12 of 23\nFebruary 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nsuggest that would be a possibility in a recent speech. And I wonder if that view is broadly\nshared on the Committee.\nCHAIR POWELL. So the Committee obviously did not see this as the time to pause.\nWe judged that the appropriate, you know, thing to do at this meeting was to raise the federal\nfunds rate by 25 basis points. And we said that we continue to anticipate that ongoing increases\nin the target range will be appropriate in order to attain that stance of sufficiently restrictive\nmonetary policy that will bring inflation down to 2 percent. So that’s the judgment that we\nmade. You know, we’re going to write down new forecasts in March, and we’ll—you know,\nwe’ll certainly be looking at the incoming data as everyone else will.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Sorry, I should have been clearer. I mean, would it be possible to\ntake a meeting off, for example, and then resume? You know, could you, rather than just doing\nat every meeting that move, go a little bit more slowly, take some gaps in between moves?\nCHAIR POWELL. I mean, I think this is not something that the Committee is thinking\nabout or exploring in any kind of detail. In principle, though, you know, we used to—the thing\nwe used to do was go every other meeting, if you remember, 25 basis points, and that was\nconsidered a fast pace. So I think a lot of options are available. And I mean, you saw what the\nBank of Canada did and, you know, they left it that they’re willing to raise rates after pausing.\nBut this is not something that the Federal Open Market Committee is on the point of deciding\nright now.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Mr. Chairman, the SEP has the PCE\ninflation rate in 2023 at 3.1 percent. Meanwhile, the three-month annualized PCE is 2.1 percent,\nand you’ve achieved this without going to your 5.1 percent funds rate, which is what you have\nPage 13 of 23\nFebruary 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\npenciled in for this year. And you’ve also achieved it without the 1 percentage point increase in\nthe unemployment rate, which you have penciled in for this year. I’m wondering if you’ve\nconsidered the idea of whether or not your understanding of the inflation dynamic may be wrong,\nand it’s possible to achieve these things without raising rates that high and also without the surge\nin unemployment.\nAnd, specifically, I wonder if you might comment on the speech given by Vice Chair\nLael Brainard, who said, “To the extent that inputs other than wages may be responsible in part\nfor important price increases for some nonhousing services, an unwinding of these factors.” In\nother words, it may not be wages. The idea that it may not require unemployment rising to get\nthis sector of inflation under control. Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. So a couple of things. First, on the forecast, if—you’re right—if you\ntake very short-term three-month, say, measures of PCE—core PCE inflation, they’re quite low\nright now. But that’s because that’s driven by, you know, significantly negative readings from\ngoods inflation. Most forecasters would think that the significantly negative readings will be\ntransitory and that goods inflation will move up fairly soon, back up to its longer-run trend of\nsomething around zero, something like that. So a lot of forecasts would call for core PCE to go\nback up to 4 percent by the middle of the year, for example. So that’s really where the\nsustainable level is. It’s more like at 4 percent. So that would suggest there’s work left to do.\nYou know, let’s say inflation does come down much faster than we expect, which is possible.\nAs I mentioned, you know, obviously our policy is data dependent. We would take that into\naccount.\nIn terms of the non—sorry, the core nonhousing services, as I mentioned earlier, it’s a\nvery diverse sector, six or seven sectors. And so sectors that represent 55 or 60 percent of that—\nPage 14 of 23\nFebruary 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nsubsectors of that sector are—we think are sensitive to slack in the economy, sensitive to the\nlabor market in a way, but some of the other sectors are not. And, for example, you know,\nfinancial services is a big sector that’s really not driven by labor markets—wages. So that’s why\nI said there are a number of things that will affect—take restaurants, right? So, clearly, labor is\nimportant for restaurants but so are food prices. And, you know, transportation services is going\nto be driven by fuel prices, for example. So there are lots of things in that mix that will drive\ninflation. I would say overall, though, my own view would be that you’re not going to have, you\nknow, a sustainable return to 2 percent inflation in that sector without a better balance in the\nlabor market. And I don’t know what that will require in terms of increased unemployment, your\nquestion. I do think there are a number of dimensions through which the labor market can\nsoften. And so far, we’ve got—as I mentioned, in goods, we have inflation moving down\nwithout the softening in the labor market. I think most forecasters would say that unemployment\nwill probably rise a bit from here. But I still think—I continue to think that there’s a path to\ngetting inflation back down to 2 percent without a really significant economic decline or a\nsignificant increase in unemployment. And that’s because the—you know, the setting we’re in is\nquite different. The inflation that we originally got was very much a collision between very\nstrong demand and hard supply constraints, not something that you really have seen in prior—\nyou know, in prior business cycles. And so now we see goods inflation coming down for the\nreasons we thought, and we understand why housing inflation will come down. And I think\nwill—a story will emerge on the nonhousing services sector soon enough. But I think there is—\nthere’s ongoing disinflation, and we don’t yet see weakening in the labor market. So we’ll have\nto see.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Can we get there with 5 percent?\nPage 15 of 23\nFebruary 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. Certainly possible. Yeah. Absolutely it’s possible. You know, it’s a\nquestion—no one really knows. I think it’s because this is not like the other business cycles in\nso many ways. It may well be that as—yeah, as—that it will take more slowing than we\nexpect—than I expect to get inflation down to 2 percent. But I don’t—that’s not my base case.\nMy base case is that the economy can return to 2 percent inflation without a really significant\ndownturn or a really big increase in unemployment. I think that’s a possible outcome. I think\nmany, many forecasters would say it’s not the most likely outcome. But I would say there’s a\nchance of it.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Michael.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg TV and Radio. I’d like to pick\nup on what you were just saying about a substantial downturn and ask, with the full weight of\nyour tightening not in place yet and with the progress against inflation, there’s still a lot of talk\nabout very, very slow growth going forward in 2023. And the recession indicators are all\nsuggesting that we are going to see recession this year. So I’m wondering if you’ve changed\nyour view or you have a more nuanced view of what you think the danger to economic growth is\ngoing forward and whether you’re very close to perhaps tipping it into the wrong place, which\ncalls for more restraint on your part.\nCHAIR POWELL. So I do think you—most forecasts and, you know, my own\nassessment would be that that growth will continue—positive growth will continue but at a\nsubdued pace as it did last year. We had growth of—GDP growth of 1 percent last year and also\nfinal sales growth, which we think is a better indicator, of about 1 percent. I think, you know,\nmost forecasts and certainly my assessment would be that growth will continue at a fairly\nsubdued level this year. There are other factors, though, that need to be considered. You will\nPage 16 of 23\nFebruary 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nhave seen that the global picture is improving a bit, and that will matter for us, potentially. The\nlabor market remains very, very strong, and that’s job creation, that’s wages. As inflation does\ncome down, sentiment will improve. You also—state and local governments are really flush\nthese days with, you know, money, and many of them are considering tax cuts or even sending\nchecks. So I think that’s going to support—they’re also spending a lot. There’s a lot of spending\ncoming in the construction pipeline, both private and public. And so that’s going to support\neconomic activity. So I think there’s a good chance that those factors will help support positive\ngrowth this year. And that’s my base case, is that there will be positive growth this year.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Okay, Rich.\nRICH MILLER. Thank you. Rich Miller from Bloomberg. First off, how are you\ndoing?\nCHAIR POWELL. Fine. Thanks. Fine.\nRICH MILLER. Good. Second off, I think, earlier on in the press conference, you said\nyou need to see substantially more evidence of inflation coming down. Can you give us some\nidea of what you’re thinking of? You mentioned three months—that we’ve seen three months in\na row. Governor Waller suggested he might want to see six months. And so is it just the\ninflation data, or do you have to see the labor market coming back into better balance to have\nthat “substantially more evidence” metric?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I don’t think there’s, you know, going to be a light switch flipped\nor anything like that. I think it’s just an accumulating—accumulation of evidence. So, of\ncourse, we’ll be looking—by the time of the March meeting, we’ll have two more employment\nreports, two more CPI reports, and we’ll be looking at those carefully as all of us will. And we’ll\nbe asking ourselves, what are they telling us? And soon after that, we’ll have another ECI wage\nPage 17 of 23\nFebruary 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nreport, which, as you know, is a report that we like because it adjusts for composition and it’s\nvery complete. And, you know, the one we got, I guess it was yesterday, was some—was\nconstructive. It’s—you know, it shows wages coming down but still at a high level. They’re\nstill at a level that’s way above—well above where they were before the pandemic. So I don’t\nwant to put a number on it in terms of months, but as the accumulated evidence comes in, it’s\ngoing to be reflected in our assessment of the outlook, and that will be reflected in our policy\nover time. But I will say, though, we—you know, it is our job to restore price stability and\nachieve 2 percent inflation for the benefit of the American public. We’re not—market\nparticipants have a very different job. It’s a fine job. It’s a great job. In fact, I did that job for\nyears but in one form or another. But, you know, we have to deliver that. And so we are\nstrongly resolved that we will, you know, complete this task because we think it has benefits that\nwill, you know, support economic activity and benefit the public for many, many years.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Edward.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you, Michelle. Thank you, Fed Chairman, for taking\nthe questions. So you’ve talked about we had solid job growth. Edward Lawrence from Fox\nBusiness, by the way. We had solid job growth, a slight falling in the increase in consumer\nspending. It seems so far it’s been relatively mild from the economy to go to—from a\n9.1 percent CPI inflation to 6.5 percent CPI inflation. Is the hard part yet to come to go from\n6.5 to 2?\nCHAIR POWELL. I don’t think we know, honestly. You know, the—so we, of course,\nexpected goods inflation to start coming down by the end of 2021, and it didn’t come down all\nthrough ’22. And now it’s coming down, and it’s come down pretty fast. So I would say these\nare—this is not a standard business cycle where you can look at the last 10 times there was a\nPage 18 of 23\nFebruary 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nglobal pandemic and we shut the economy down and Congress did what it did and we did what\nwe did. It’s just—it’s unique. So I think certainty is just not appropriate here. Inflation—it’s\njust harder to forecast inflation. It may come down faster. It may take longer to come down.\nAnd, you know, our job is to deliver inflation back to target, and we will do that. But I think\nwe’re going to be cautious about declaring victory and, you know, sending signals that we think\nthat the game is won because, you know, it’s—we’ve got a long way to go. It’s just—it’s the\nearly stages of disinflation. And it’s most welcome to be able to say that we are now in\ndisinflation, but that’s great. But we just see that it has to spread through the economy and that\nit’s going to take some time. That’s all.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Do you—how long do you see then, the federal funds rate\nremaining at this elevated level?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, so—again, my forecast and that of my colleagues as you\nwill see from the SEP and—I mean, there are many different forecasts, but, generally, it’s a\nforecast of slower growth, some softening in labor market conditions, and inflation moving down\nsteadily but not quickly. And, in that case, if the economy performs broadly in line with those\nexpectations, it will not be appropriate to cut rates this year, to loosen policy this year. Of\ncourse, other people have forecasts with inflation coming down much faster, that’s a different\nthing. You know, if that happens—inflation comes down much faster, you know, then we’ll be\nseeing that, and it will be incorporated into our thinking about policy.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Simon.\nSIMON RABINOVITCH. Thank you, Chair Powell. Simon Rabinovitch with the\nEconomist. May I ask a further question about the language around “ongoing increases?” That,\nof course, implies at least two further rate rises. If you look at fed fund and futures pricing, the\nPage 19 of 23\nFebruary 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nimplication is that you’ll raise rates one more time and then pause. Are you concerned about that\ndivergence or do you think, if everything breaks right, is that a plausible outcome?\nCHAIR POWELL. I’m not particularly concerned about the divergence, no, because it is\nlargely due to the market’s expectation that inflation will move down more quickly. I think\nthat’s the bigger part of that. So, again, as I just mentioned, we—you know, our forecasts—\ndifferent participants have different forecasts, but, generally, those forecasts are for continued\nsubdued growth, some softening in the labor market but not a recession, not a recession. And we\nhave inflation moving down, you know, into the—somewhere in the mid-threes or maybe lower\nthan that this year. We’ll update that in March, but that’s what we thought in December.\nMarkets are past that. They show inflation coming down, in some cases, much quicker than that.\nSo we’ll just have to see. And we have a different view and—a different view, it’s a different\nforecast, really. And given our outlook, I just—I don’t see us cutting rates this year if we get—if\nour outlook turns true, as I mentioned just now. If we do see inflation coming down much more\nquickly, that’ll play into our policy setting, of course.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Scott.\nSCOTT HORSLEY. Hi, Chair Powell. Scott Horsley from NPR. One of the changes in\nthe statement this month is that the Committee is no longer listing public health as among the\ndata points you’ll consider in assessing conditions. What should we make of that? Does the\nFederal Reserve no longer see the pandemic as weighing on the economy?\nCHAIR POWELL. That’s the general sense of it. Look, we understand—I personally\nunderstand well that COVID is still out there, but that it’s no longer playing an important role in\nour economy. And, you know, we’ve kept that statement in there for quite a while, and I think\nwe just—we knew we would take it out at some point. There’s never a perfect time, but we\nPage 20 of 23\nFebruary 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthought that—you know, people are handling it better, and the economy and the society are\nhandling it better now. It doesn’t really need to be in a—you know, in the Fed’s monthly, you\nknow, postmeeting statement as an ongoing economic risk as opposed to, you know, a health\nissue.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nancy.\nNANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Hi, Chair Powell. Nancy Marshall-Genzer with\nMarketplace. I wanted to go back to another thing that Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard said\nrecently. She said she doesn’t see signs of a wage–price spiral, and I’m wondering if you agree\nwith that.\nCHAIR POWELL. I do. Yeah, I do. You don’t see that yet. But the whole point is, you\nknow, if you—once you see it, you have a serious problem. That means that, effectively, in\npeople’s decisionmaking, inflation has become a really salient issue. And once that happens—\nthat’s what we can’t allow to happen. And, you know, so that’s why we worry that the longer\nwe’re at this and the longer people are talking about inflation all day long, every day, you know,\nthe more risk of something like that. But no, there’s not much—it’s more of a risk. It always\nhas been more of a risk than anything else. By the way, I think it’s becoming less salient. And\npeople are—you know, we pick that up in conversations. And I’ve seen some data, too, that\nshow people are, you know, gradually—they’re glad that inflation is coming down. People\nreally don’t like inflation. And as we see it coming down, that could also add a boost to\neconomic activity. You look at the sentiment surveys now, and they’re very, very low with\n3½ percent unemployment and, you know, high wage increases nominally by historical\nstandards. Why can that be? It has to be inflation, right? So I think once inflation is seen to be\ncoming down in coming months, even you will also see a boost to sentiment, I hope.\nPage 21 of 23\nFebruary 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nNANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. So that’s what you’re looking at most closely, is\nconsumer expectations?\nCHAIR POWELL. That’s at the very heart, is consumers and businesses that, you know,\nare the—essentially, we believe that expectations of future inflation are a very important part of\nthe process of creating inflation. That’s a sort of bedrock belief. In one way or another, it has to\nbe. We think it’s important. And, in this case, I would say, the risk eight months ago or so,\nlonger-term inflation expectations had moved up. We moved quite vigorously last year.\nExpectations are—seem to be well anchored, including at the shorter end now, not just the longer\nend. So it’s, you know—and that’s—I think that’s very reassuring. I think, you know, the\nmarkets have decided, and the public has decided, that inflation is going to come back down to\n2 percent and it’s just a matter of us following through. That's immeasurably helpful to the\nprocess of getting inflation down. The fact that people now do generally believe that it will\ncome down, that’ll be part of the process of getting it down. And it’s a very positive thing.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Greg.\nGREG ROBB. Thank you, Chair Powell. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. In the\nminutes of the December meeting, there was a couple of sentences that struck people as\nimportant, when the Committee said participants talked about this unwarranted easing of\nfinancial conditions was a risk and it would make your life harder to bring inflation down. I\nhaven’t seen—heard you talk much about that today or in the statement. So I was wondering,\nhas that concern eased among members, or is that still something you’re concerned about?\nThank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. I would put it this way. It’s something that we monitor carefully.\nFinancial conditions didn’t really change much from the December meeting to now. They\nPage 22 of 23\nFebruary 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nmostly went sideways or up and down but came out in roughly the same place. It’s important\nthat the markets do reflect the tightening that we’re putting in place. As we’ve discussed a\ncouple times here, there’s a difference in perspective by some market measures on how fast\ninflation will come down. We’re just going to have to see. I mean, I’m not going to try to\npersuade people to have a different forecast, but our forecast is that it will take some time and\nsome patience and that we’ll need to keep rates higher for longer. But we’ll see.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Brendan, for the last question.\nBRENDAN PEDERSEN. Hi, Chair Powell. Brendon Pedersen with Punchbowl News.\nI wanted to ask if the Fed takes into account at all the debt ceiling when it comes to quantitative\ntightening, given the fact that rapid or faster quantitative tightening could bring us closer, faster\nto that drop-dead debt ceiling deadline. Could it play in effect as we get closer to that drop-dead\ndeadline this summer?\nCHAIR POWELL. Look, I—it’s very hard to think about all the different possible\nramifications. And I think the answer is, basically, I don’t think there’s likely to be any\nimportant interaction between the two, because I believe Congress will wind up acting, and—as\nit will and must, in the end, to raise the debt ceiling in a way that doesn’t risk, you know, the\nprogress we’re making against inflation and the economy and the financial sector. I believe that\nthat will happen. I believe it will happen. You know, we, of course, will monitor money market\nconditions carefully as—you know, as the process moves on. For example, the Treasury General\nAccount will shrink down, and then it will grow back up. And we understand there’ll be lots of\nflows between there and the overnight repo facility and reserves. We understand all that. We’re\nwatching it carefully. We’ll just be monitoring it.\nThank you very much.\nPage 23 of 23"

    "press_conf": "March 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nTranscript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference\nMarch 22, 2023\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. Before discussing today’s meeting, let me briefly\naddress recent developments in the banking sector. In the past two weeks, serious difficulties at\na small number of banks have emerged. History has shown that isolated banking problems, if\nleft unaddressed, can undermine confidence in healthy banks and threaten the ability of the\nbanking system as a whole to play its vital role in supporting the savings and credit needs of\nhouseholds and businesses. That is why, in response to these events, the Federal Reserve,\nworking with the Treasury Department and the FDIC, took decisive actions to protect the U.S.\neconomy and to strengthen public confidence in our banking system. These actions demonstrate\nthat all depositors’ savings and the banking system are safe. With the support of the Treasury,\nthe Federal Reserve Board created the Bank Term Funding Program to ensure that banks that\nhold safe and liquid assets can, if needed, borrow reserves against those assets at par. This\nprogram, along with our long-standing discount window, is effectively meeting the unusual\nfunding needs that some banks have faced and makes clear that ample liquidity in the system is\navailable.\nOur banking system is sound and resilient, with strong capital and liquidity. We will\ncontinue to closely monitor conditions in the banking system and are prepared to use all of our\ntools as needed to keep it safe and sound. In addition, we are committed to learning the lessons\nfrom this episode and to work to prevent episodes—events like this from happening again.\nTurning to the broader economy and monetary policy: Inflation remains too high, and\nthe labor market continues to be very tight. My colleagues and I understand the hardship that\nhigh inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to\nour 2 percent goal. Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve. Without price\nPage 1 of 23\nMarch 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nstability, the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will\nnot achieve a sustained period of long—of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.\nThe U.S. economy slowed significantly last year, with real GDP rising at a below-trend\npace of 0.9 percent. Consumer spending appears to have picked up this quarter, although some\nof that strength may reflect the effects of swings in the weather across the turn of the year. In\ncontrast, activity in the housing sector remains weak, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates.\nHigher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed\ninvestment.\nCommittee participants generally expect subdued growth to continue. As shown in our\nSummary of Economic Projections, the median projection for real GDP growth stands at just 0.4\npercent this year and 1.2 percent next year, well below the median estimate of the longer-run\nnormal growth rate. And nearly all participants see the risks to GDP growth as weighted to the\ndownside.\nYet the labor market remains extremely tight. Job gains have picked up in recent months,\nwith employment rising by an average of 351,000 jobs per month over the last three months.\nThe unemployment rate remained low in February at 3.6 percent. The labor force participation\nrate has edged up in recent months, and wage growth has shown some signs of easing. However,\nwith job vacancies still very high, labor demand substantially exceeds the supply of available\nworkers. FOMC participants expect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come\ninto better balance over time, easing upward pressures on wages and prices. The median\nunemployment rate projection in the SEP rises to 4.5 percent at the end of this year and\n4.6 percent at the end of next year.\nPage 2 of 23\nMarch 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nInflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. Over the 12 months\nending in January, total PCE prices rose 5.4 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy\ncategories. Core PCE—excluding those, core PCE prices rose 4.7 percent. In February, the\n12-month change in the CPI came in at 6 percent, and the change in the core CPI was\n5.5 percent. Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year, but the strength of\nthese recent readings indicates that inflation pressures continue to run high. The median\nprojection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 3.3 percent for this year, 2.5 percent next year,\nand 2.1 percent in 2025. The process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way\nto go and is likely to be bumpy.\nDespite elevated inflation, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well\nanchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as\nwell as measures from financial markets.\nThe Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware\nthat high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for\nthose least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We\nare highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are\nstrongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.\nAt today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by\n¼ percentage point, bringing the target range to 4¾ to 5 percent. And we are continuing the\nprocess of significantly reducing our securities holdings.\nSince our previous FOMC meeting, economic indicators have generally come in stronger\nthan expected, demonstrating greater momentum in economic activity and inflation. We believe,\nPage 3 of 23\nMarch 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nhowever, that events in the banking system over the past two weeks are likely to result in tighter\ncredit conditions for households and businesses, which would in turn affect economic outcomes.\nIt is too soon to determine the extent of these effects and therefore too soon to tell how monetary\npolicy should respond. As a result, we no longer state that we anticipate that ongoing rate\nincreases will be appropriate to quell inflation; instead, we now anticipate that some additional\npolicy firming may be appropriate. We will closely monitor incoming data and carefully assess\nthe actual and expected effects of tighter credit conditions on economic activity, the labor\nmarket, and inflation, and our policy decisions will reflect that assessment.\nIn our SEP, each FOMC participant wrote down an appropriate path for the federal funds\nrate based on what that participant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward. If the\neconomy evolves as projected, the median participant projects that the appropriate level of the\nfederal funds rate will be 5.1 percent at the end of this year, 4.3 percent at the end of 2024, and\n3.1 percent at the end of 2025. These are little changed from our December projections,\nreflecting offsetting factors. These projections are not a Committee decision or plan; if the\neconomy does not evolve as projected, the path for policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our\nmaximum-employment and price-stability goals. We will continue to make our meeting—\ndecisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the vincoming data and their implications\nfor the outlook for economic activity and inflation.\nWe remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep\nlonger-term inflation expectations well anchored. Reducing inflation is likely to require a period\nof below-trend growth and some softening in labor market conditions. Restoring price stability\nis essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer\nrun.\nPage 4 of 23\nMarch 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nTo conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses\nacross the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do\neverything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.\nThank you. I look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Colby.\nCOLBY SMITH. Thank you. Colby Smith with the Financial Times. How confident is\nthe Committee that the recent stress that we’ve seen, and you’ve alluded to, is contained at this\npoint and that deposit flight among midsize lenders in particular has ceased?\nCHAIR POWELL. Thanks. So I, I guess our view is that the banking system is sound\nand it’s resilient—it’s got strong capital [and] liquidity. We took powerful actions with [the]\nTreasury and the FDIC, which demonstrate that all depositors’ savings are safe and that the\nbanking system is safe. Deposit flows in the banking system have stabilized over the last week.\nAnd the last thing I’ll say is that we’ve undertaken—we’re undertaking a thorough internal\nreview that will identify where we can strengthen supervision and regulation.\nCOLBY SMITH. Okay, just a quick follow-up: I mean, given all the stress and the\nuncertainty that you’ve also alluded to in the statement, how seriously was a—was a pause\nconsidered for this meeting?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we considered—we did consider that in the days running up to the\nmeeting, and you see the decision that we made, which I’ll say a couple things about. First, it\nwas supported by a very strong consensus, and I’ll be happy to explain why. And, really, it is\nthat the intermeeting data on inflation and the labor market came in stronger than expected and,\nreally, before the recent events, we were clearly on track to continue with ongoing rate hikes. In\nfact, as of a couple of weeks ago, it looked like we’d need to raise rates over the course of the\nPage 5 of 23\nMarch 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nyear more than we had expected at the time of the SEP in December—at the time of the\nDecember meeting. We are committed to restoring price stability, and all of the evidence says\nthat the public has confidence that we will do so—that we’ll bring inflation down to 2 percent\nover time. It is important that we sustain that confidence with our actions as well as our words.\nSo we also assess, as I mentioned, that the events of the last two weeks are likely to result\nin some tightening credit conditions for households and businesses and thereby weigh on\ndemand, on the labor market, and on inflation. Such a tightening in financial conditions would\nwork in the same direction as rate tightening. In principle, as a matter of fact, you can think of it\nas being the equivalent of a rate hike or perhaps more than that; of course, it’s not possible to\nmake that assessment today with any precision whatsoever. So our decision was to move ahead\nwith the 25 basis point hike and to change our guidance, as I mentioned, from ongoing hikes to\nsome, some additional hikes maybe—some policy firming may be appropriate. So going\nforward, as I mentioned, in assessing the need for, for further hikes, we’ll be focused as always\non the incoming data and the evolving outlook and, in particular, on our assessment of the actual\nand expected effects of credit tightening.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Mr. Chairman, can you explain the difference between ongoing rate\nincreases and firming? Does firming imply a rate increase per se, or could policy firm without\nyou increasing rates?\nCHAIR POWELL. No, I think it’s, it’s meant to refer to our policy rate. Really, I would\nfocus on, on the words “may” and “some,” as opposed to “ongoing.” Ongoing. So we, we\nclearly were—what we were doing there was taking onboard the—trying to reflect the\nuncertainty about what will happen. I mean, it, it’s possible that this will turn out to have very\nPage 6 of 23\nMarch 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nmodest effects—that these events will turn out to be very, very modest effects on the economy,\nin which case inflation will continue to be strong—in which case, you know, the path will look—\nmight look different. It’s also possible that this potential tightening will contribute significant\ntightening in credit conditions over time and, in principle, if that—that means that monetary\npolicy may have less work to do. We simply don’t know. So.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Do you have concerns that the recent—that the hike you did today\ncould further exacerbate the problem in the banks?\nCHAIR POWELL. No. I mean, with our monetary policy, we’re, we’re really focused\non macroeconomic outcomes. In particular, we’re focused on, on this potential credit tightening\nand what can that produce in the way of tighter credit conditions. I think when we think about\nthe situation with the banks, we’re focused on our—on our financial stability tools, in particular\nour lending facilities, the debt—sorry, the discount window, and also the new facility.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nick.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, in your\ntestimony two weeks ago, you had indicated you thought the terminal rate would be higher.\nObviously, that was before the stress in the banking sector. And I realize there’s a lot of\nuncertainty, but can you—can you explain at all to what extent your forecasts or those of your\ncolleagues or those of the Board staff incorporated today a material tightening of credit\navailability because of the stress in the banking sector, or are you waiting to see it in the data\nbefore you incorporate that potential tightening into your forecasts?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, you know, we have just come from an FOMC meeting and, you\nknow, the people who write the minutes will be very carefully counting, but I’ll tell you what I\nheard. What I heard was significant number of people saying that they anticipated there would\nPage 7 of 23\nMarch 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nbe some, some tightening of credit conditions and that would really have the same effects as, as\nour policies do, and that therefore they were including that in their assessment and that if that did\nturn out not to be the case, in principle you would need more rate hikes. So some people did\nreflect that in their FOMC—in their SEP forecasts. I think there may also just have been—\nremember, this is 12 days ago. You know, we’re trying to assess something that just is so recent\nand it’s people—you know, it’s very difficult, there’s so much uncertainty. So December was a\ngood place to start, and we wound up with—we wound up with very similar outcomes for\nDecember. And, you know, in a way, the early—the data in the first part—the first five weeks of\nthe intermeeting period pointed to stronger inflation and stronger labor markets. So that pointed\nto higher rates. And then this, this latter part kind of—the possibility of credit conditions\ntightening really, really offset that, effectively.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. To follow up: Have you considered at all whether your primary tool,\nthe funds rate, is going to be enough to sustain the kind of tighter financial conditions that you\nbelieve will be necessary without doing significant damage to the banking sector? Have you, for\nexample, considered changing reserve requirements, selling assets out of the System Open\nMarket Account, as a way to better achieve tighter financial conditions that don’t accelerate\ndeposit erosion, for example, from banks?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, we know that we have other, other tools in effect, but no,\nwe think our monetary policy tool works, and we think, you know, many, many banks—our rate\nhikes were well telegraphed to the market, and many banks have managed to handle them.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi. Victoria Guida with Politico. I wanted to ask—you, along\nwith the FDIC and the Treasury—the Fed Board decided to invoke the systemic risk exception to\nPage 8 of 23\nMarch 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nallow uninsured depositors to be protected at these two banks. I was just wondering if you could\nspeak to why that decision was made. Was it purely a confidence issue, or was there a concern\nthat there would be some sort of economic contagion or financial contagion from the failure of\nthese banks?\nCHAIR POWELL. The issue was really not about those specific banks, but about the\nrisk of a contagion to, to other banks and to the financial markets more broadly. That was the\nissue.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Okay, and then can you also—just to follow up, can you speak to\nthe role that you will be playing in the Fed’s internal investigation on its supervision and\nregulation?\nCHAIR POWELL. So Vice Chair Barr is, is of course leading that review. And he’s\nresponsible for it in his capacity as Vice Chair for Supervision. We—I realized, you know, right\naway that, that there was going to be a need for review. I mean, the question we’re all asking\nourselves over that first weekend was, how did this happen? And so what we did was, early\nMonday morning, we sat down and said, “Let’s do this.” And he, he was obviously going to lead\nit in his capacity. So I don’t—my role was to announce it, and I get briefed on it, but I’m not\ninvolved in, in the work of it.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Howard.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Hi, Chair Powell. Howard Schneider from Reuters. So I\nwant to go back to your February press conference. You mentioned the word “disinflation,” I\nbelieve, 9 or 10 times, a process that you felt was—I forget the word you used—but gratefully\nunder way, or something like that. Is disinflation still occurring in the U.S. today?\nPage 9 of 23\nMarch 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes. I mean, what actually happened, Howard, was I got the\nquestion 12 times, so it’s—maybe it’s a feature, not a bug. But, so, but yeah, absolutely the\nsame—the story is intact, so it’s really three parts, right? Goods inflation has been coming down\nnow for six months; it’s proceeding more slowly than we would have liked, but it’s certainly\nproceeding. Housing services is, is really a matter of time passing. We continue to see the new\nleases being signed at much lower levels of inflation. So that’s 44 percent of the—of the core\nPCE index, where you’ve got a story that’s ongoing. Where we didn’t have in February, and we\nstill don’t have now, is a sign of progress in the nonhousing services sector. And that is, you\nknow, that’s just something that will have to come through softening demand and perhaps some\nsoftening in labor market conditions. We don’t see that yet. And that’s, that’s of course\n56 percent of the index. So the story is pretty much the same. I will say that the inflation data\nthat we got, to your point, really pointed to stronger inflation.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. If I could follow up on that, I was curious why you don’t see\nmore coming from the credit crunch, because it seems to me that’s something that you’d actually\nwelcome to a degree and expect. And are you not seeing more coming from that because you\ndon’t know, or because you just don’t want to have another round of wishful thinking?\nCHAIR POWELL. So it’s really just a question of not knowing at this point. There’s a\ngreat deal of literature on the connection between tighter credit conditions, economic activity,\nhiring, and inflation. Very large body of literature. The question is, how significant will this\ncredit tightening be and how sustainable it will be? That’s, that’s the issue. And we don’t really\nsee it yet, so, so people are making estimates, you know, people are publishing estimates, but it’s\nvery kind of rule-of-thumb guesswork almost at this point. But we think it’s, it’s potentially\nPage 10 of 23\nMarch 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nquite real and that argues for, you know, being alert as we go forward. As we think about further\nrate hikes for us, we’ll be paying attention to the actual and expected effects from that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jeanna.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Chair Powell. Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times.\nThank you for taking our questions. I wonder if you could talk a little bit—I know that you’ve\ngot your internal review coming, but I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what you think\nhappened with oversight at Silicon Valley Bank and whether this suggests that something about\nregulation and supervision needs to actually change going forward. And I wonder, you know,\nhow can the American people have confidence that there aren’t other weaknesses out there in the\nbanking system, given that this one got missed, as you noted?\nCHAIR POWELL. So let me say what, what I think happened, and then I’ll come to the\nquestions around supervision. So, at a basic level, Silicon Valley Bank management failed\nbadly—they grew the bank very quickly, they exposed the bank to significant liquidity risk and\ninterest rate risk, didn’t hedge that risk. We now know that supervisors saw these risks and, and\nintervened. We know that the public saw all this. We know that SVB experienced an\nunprecedentedly rapid and massive bank run. So this is a—this is a very large group of\nconnected depositors—concentrated group of connected depositors in a very, very fast run, faster\nthan historical record would suggest. So as for us—so for our part, we’re doing a review of\nsupervision and regulation. My only interest is that we identify what went wrong here. How did\nthis happen is the question. What went wrong? Try to find that. We will find that. And then\nmake an assessment of what are the right policies to put in place so that it doesn’t happen again,\nand then implement those policies. It would be inappropriate for me at this stage to offer my\nviews on what the answers might be. You know, I simply can’t do that. Vice Chair Barr is\nPage 11 of 23\nMarch 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nleading this, and I think he’s testifying next week. So—but that will be up to him. So that’s\nreally where it is. You know, the, the review is going to be thorough and transparent. It is\nclear—really to your last question—it’s clear that we do need to strengthen supervision and\nregulation. And I, I assume that there will be recommendations coming out of the report, and I, I\nplan on supporting them and supporting their implementation.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. And the final point—you know, can we feel confident that these\nweaknesses don’t exist elsewhere, given that they got missed at this bank?\nCHAIR POWELL. These are not weaknesses that are—that are at all broadly through\nthe banking system. This was—this was a bank that was an outlier in terms of both its\npercentage of, of uninsured deposits and in terms of its holdings of duration risk. And again,\nsupervisors did get in there, and, and they were, as you know, obviously, you know they were—\nthey were on this issue, but nonetheless, this, this still happened. And so that’s really the nature\nof the interview—sorry, of the review—is to discover that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Michael McKee.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television. You’ve\nbeen very consistent in saying that the Fed would be raising interest rates and then holding them\nthere for quite some time. Following today’s decision, the markets have now priced in one more\nincrease in May, and then every meeting the rest of this year they’re pricing in rate cuts. Are\nthey getting this totally wrong from the Fed, or is there something different about the way you’re\nlooking at it, given that you’re now thinking that moves might be appropriate as opposed to\nongoing?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we published an SEP today, as you will have seen, and it shows\nthat basically participants expect relatively slow growth, a gradual rebalancing of supply and\nPage 12 of 23\nMarch 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ndemand in the labor market, with inflation moving down gradually. In that most likely case, if\nthat happens, participants don’t see rate cuts this year. They just don’t. I would just say: As\nalways, the path of the economy is uncertain, and policy is going to reflect what actually happens\nrather than what we write down in the SEP. But that’s not our baseline expectation.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Well, if I could follow up and ask, as you look forward into the\nrest of the year here, are you saying that what you see and the 5.1 percent basically consensus is\nbased on being—it will be sufficiently restrictive? Or is it leavened by the idea of you don’t\nknow what's going to happen? In other words, what should people think about in terms of how\nthe Fed thinks about how far it is from the terminal?\nCHAIR POWELL. It’s going to depend. Remember, we’re looking—for purposes of\nour monetary policy tool, we’re looking at what’s happening among the banks and asking, is\nthere going to be some tightening in credit conditions? And then we’re thinking about that as\neffectively doing the same thing that rate hikes do. So, in a way, that substitutes for rate hikes.\nSo, the key is, we have to have—policy has got to be tight enough to bring inflation down to\n2 percent over time. It doesn’t all have to come from rate hikes: It can come from, you know,\nfrom tighter credit conditions. So we’re looking at, and we, we—it’s highly uncertain how long\nthe situation will be sustained or how significant any of those effects would be, so we’re just\ngoing to have to watch. In the meantime, you know—obviously, at the end of the day, we will\ndo enough to bring inflation down to 2 percent. No one should doubt that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Rachel Siegel.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Hi, Chair Powell. Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. Thank\nyou for taking our questions. I know we’ve talked a bit about how Silicon Valley Bank was\nunique to a certain sector of the economy, but there’s also growing concern that there are\nPage 13 of 23\nMarch 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nfinancial stability risks from the commercial real estate market and loans that will begin to roll\nover later this year and next, and that smaller regional banks also disproportionately hold those\nloans. Is there a risk that could mimic the kind of—what we saw with SVB to banks that\ndisproportionately are focused in commercial real estate?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, you know, we’re well aware of the concentrations people have in\ncommercial real estate. I really don’t think it’s comparable to this. The, the banking system is,\nis strong, it is sound, it is resilient, it’s well capitalized, and I really don’t see that as at all\nanalogous to this.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. And one other question: Would you be open to an independent\ninvestigation, separate from the Fed’s probe?\nCHAIR POWELL. I welcome—it’s 100 percent certainty that there will be independent\ninvestigations and outside investigations and all that. So we welcome—when a bank fails, there\nare investigations. And, of course, we welcome that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Edward.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Edward Lawrence from Fox\nBusiness. Inflation has been rather sticky, so do you need help from the fiscal side to get\ninflation down faster?\nCHAIR POWELL. We don’t assume that. We don’t give advice to the fiscal authorities,\nand we assume that—we take fiscal policy as, as it comes to our front door, stick it in our model\nalong with a million other things. We have responsibility for price stability. The Federal\nReserve has responsibility for that. And nothing’s going to change that. So—and we will get\ninflation down to 2 percent in time.\nPage 14 of 23\nMarch 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. And if I can follow on that, but they’re working—the\nspending that’s happened is working against what you are doing, right? So it’s prolonging\ninflation.\nCHAIR POWELL. You have to look at, at the impulse from spending because spending\nwas, of course, tremendously high during the pandemic, and then, as the pandemic programs\nrolled off, spending actually came down, so the—this sort of fiscal impulse is actually not what’s\ndriving inflation right now. It was—it was at the beginning perhaps part of what was driving\ninflation, but that’s not really the story now.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Neil Irwin.\nNEIL IRWIN. Hi, Chair Powell. Neil Irwin with Axios. Two questions about aspects of\nthe government’s response on Silicon Valley Bank two weekends ago. First, why is this new\nbank funding facility done under emergency 13(3) authority, as opposed to expansion of the\ndiscount window, changing the terms of the discount window that’s been around a long time?\nAnd, second, can you discuss the Fed’s role in the—in the FDIC guarantee of uninsured\ndepositors and why there’s $143 billion on your balance sheets last week, supporting that deposit\nguarantee?\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So 13(3) seemed like the right—we have a little more\nflexibility under section 13(3). We’ve done quite a lot under the discount window as well. We\nneeded to do a special facility that was designed a certain way, so we did it under 13(3). Really\nno magic to that. It’s only available in unusual and exigent circumstances, and it has to be—\nmeet certain requirements, but it seemed to be the right place. So with the FDIC, we’re just,\nwe’re lending to the, in effect, we’re—we’re lending to the bridge bank. So that’s where the\nPage 15 of 23\nMarch 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nfunds came from, and it’s—it’s a loan that’s 100 percent guaranteed by the FDIC, so there’s no\nrisk in it for us.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Okay, Chris Rugaber.\nCHRIS RUGABER. Thank you. Chris Rugaber at Associated Press. The SEB—SEP\nsuggests one more rate hike, as does the change in the language in the statement and which\nsuggests that you’re perhaps nearing the end of a cycle of rate hikes. Do you feel, though, that if\ninflation remains high, you’ll be able to resume additional hikes as needed, or have you\nsomewhat tied your hands here with these signals about rate hikes coming to an end? Thank\nyou.\nCHAIR POWELL. No, absolutely not. No, we, if we need to raise hike—raise rates\nhigher, we will. I think for now though we, we—as I’ve mentioned, we see the likelihood of, of\ncredit tightening. We know that can have, you know, an effect on the macroeconomy, on\ndemand, on labor market, on inflation, and we’re—we’re going to be watching to see what that\nis. And we’ll also be watching what’s happening with inflation and in the labor market. So\nwe’ll be watching all those things, and of course we will—we will eventually get to [a] tight\nenough policy to bring inflation down to 2 percent. We’ll find ourselves at that place.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Kyle.\nKYLE CAMPBELL. Hi, Chair Powell—thanks for taking the question. Kyle Campbell\nwith American Banker. I have a couple questions about the balance sheet. First of all, I’m\ncurious at what point the financial supports that the Fed is extending through the discount\nwindow and through its enhanced lending facility might be at odds with the objective of reducing\nthe balance sheet. And I’m also curious what your thoughts are on the—not just the availability\nPage 16 of 23\nMarch 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nof reserves but the distribution of them throughout the banking system and at what point you\nmight be concerned about it being scarce for certain banks.\nCHAIR POWELL. So—People think of QE and QT in different ways, so let me be clear\nabout how I’m thinking about these recent developments. So the recent liquidity provision that\nhas increased the size of our balance sheet but the intent and the effects of it are very different\nfrom what we—from when we expand our balance sheet through purchases of longer-term\nsecurities. Large-scale purchases of long-term securities are, are really meant to alter the stance\nof policy by pushing down—pushing up the price and down the rates, longer-term rates, which\nsupports demand through channels we understand fairly well. The balance sheet expansion is\nreally temporary lending to banks to meet those special liquidity demands created by the recent\ntensions; it’s not intended to directly alter the stance of monetary policy. We do believe that it’s\nworking. It’s having its intended effect of bolstering confidence in the banking system and\nthereby forestalling what might otherwise have been an abrupt and outsized tightening in\nfinancial conditions. So that’s working.\nIn terms of the distribution of reserves, we, we don’t see ourselves as, as running into\nreserve shortages. We, we think that our program of allowing our balance sheet to, to run off\npredictably, predicatbly and passively is working. And of course we’re, we’re always prepared\nto, to change that if that changes. But we don’t see any evidence that that’s changed.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Catarina.\nCATARINA SARAIVA. Hi, Chair. Catarina Saraiva with Bloomberg News. The\nminutes of the January–February meeting, the last meeting, indicate that you discussed the\npossibility of runs on nonbank financial institutions and the impact of large unrealized losses on\nbank portfolios. Can you talk a little bit more about that discussion—kind of what was talked\nPage 17 of 23\nMarch 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nabout in light of that, and then why didn’t the Fed, you know, do anything about that at that point\nto ultimately prevent, you know, what happened this month?\nCHAIR POWELL. I mean, to be honest, I don’t—I don’t recall the specifics of that. It’s\nbeen quite an interesting seven weeks. But, but I will tell you, though, that we have—there have\nbeen presentations about, about interest rate risk. I mean, it’s been in all the newspapers. It’s not\na surprise that there are institutions that have—that have had unhedged long positions in long-\nduration securities that have lost value as, as longer-term rates have gone up due to our rate\nincreases. So that’s, that’s not a surprise. I, I think, as you know, as is now in the public record,\nthe supervisory team was apparently engaged, very much engaged with the bank repeatedly, and\nwas escalating but, you know, nonetheless, what happened happened. And so that’s really the\npurpose of—one way to think about the review that Vice Chair Barr is conducting is to try to\nunderstand how that happened and try to understand how we can do better and what policies we\nneed to change. I mean, one thing is the speed of the—I’ll come back to that, the speed of the\nrun, it’s very different from what we’ve seen in the past, and it does kind of suggest that there’s a\nneed for possible, you know, regulatory and supervisory changes just because supervision and\nregulation need to keep up with what’s, what’s happening in the world.\nCATARINA SARAIVA. Can you confirm whether or not the Board knew about these\nescalations by the examiners in San Francisco?\nCHAIR POWELL. I will have to come back to you on that. Yeah, I don’t know.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Simon.\nSIMON RABINOVITCH. Hi. Simon Rabinovitch with the Economist. Thank you very\nmuch. Chair Powell, you stated twice today that all depositors’ savings in the banking system\nare safe. Are you saying that de facto deposit insurance covers all savings? Shouldn’t Congress\nPage 18 of 23\nMarch 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nhave a say in that? and, just by way of example, if a bank with less than $1 billion in assets\nfailed, are you promising to bail out all of its depositors? Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, I’m not saying anything more than I’m saying. So—but what\nI’m saying is you’ve seen that we have the tools to protect depositors when there’s a threat of\nserious harm to the economy or to—or to the financial system, and we’re prepared to use those\ntools. And I think depositors should assume that their—that their deposits are safe.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Greg Robb.\nGREG ROBB. Thank you, Chair Powell. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. I was\nwondering if you could give us a little bit more color. You gave just a little bit of color. You\nsaid during the first week of the Silicon Valley weekend—you said the question you guys asked\nwas “How did this happen?” when you saw Silicon Valley Bank. So I was wondering if you\ncould go to the Credit Suisse merger. I mean, wasn’t that the big gorilla in the room? Aren’t—\ndidn’t you breathe a sigh of relief when that merger happened? Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So, you know, we—that was really the Swiss government that\nwe of course were, were following it over the course of the weekend, and we were engaged with\ntheir authorities in the way that you would expect, all the ways that you would expect. It seems\nto have been a positive outcome in the sense that the transaction was agreed to, and it has been—\nthe markets have accepted it, and it seems to have gone well, and I think there was a concern that\nit might not go well. So coming into the middle of this week, yes, I would say that that is going\nwell so far.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nicole.\nNICOLE GOODKIND. Hi. Thank you, Chair Powell. Nicole Goodkind with CNN\nBusiness. In the Summary of Economic Projections, the FOMC sees the unemployment rate\nPage 19 of 23\nMarch 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nincreasing to 4.5 percent this year. I’m wondering how you anticipate preventing this from\nsnowballing while using the admittedly blunt tools at your disposal.\nCHAIR POWELL. So that’s just—that’s an estimate of what will happen as demand\nslows and as conditions soften in the labor market and it’s just—it’s a highly uncertain estimate.\nAnd, I mean, I was really—we have to bring inflation down to 2 percent. The costs of bringing it\ndown—there are real costs to bringing it down to 2 percent, but the costs of failing are much\nhigher. And if you read your history, as I’m sure you have, you can see that if the central bank\ndoesn’t get inflation back in place, get inflation—make sure that inflation expectations remain\nanchored, you can have a long series of years where inflation is high and volatile, and it’s hard to\ninvest capital, it’s hard for an economy to perform well. And we’re looking to avoid that and,\nyou know, to get back to where we need to be—back to where we were for a quarter century, and\nget there as quickly as we can.\nNICOLE GOODKIND. But I guess the question is, historically, it’s hard to—\nhistorically, it’s been hard to contain unemployment and I, I—the question is, do you worry\nabout some sort of snowball effect, and how do you factor that into your projections and your\nthoughts?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, it depends on whether you—so recessions tend to be nonlinear,\nand so they’re very hard to model. You know, the models all work in a kind of linear way—if\nyou have more of this, you get more of that. But when a recession happens, the reactions tend to\nbe nonlinear and that’s what—so we don’t know whether that’ll happen this time. We don’t\nknow—if so, we don’t know how significant it will be, and so, you know, we’re very focused on\ngetting inflation down because we know in the longer run that that is the thing that will most\nbenefit the people we serve. That’s how we can have a long—you know, we’ve had very strong\nPage 20 of 23\nMarch 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nlabor markets through these long expansions that we’ve had. Four of the five longest, or three of\nthe four longest expansions in U.S. history have been really since the high-inflation period. And\nthe reason was inflation wasn’t forcing the central bank to come in and stop an incipient or, or,\nyou know, an expansion. You can have very, very long expansions without high inflation, and\nwe had several of those, and they’re very good for people. You see late in an expansion—you\nsee low unemployment, you see the benefits of wages going to people at the lower end of the\nwage spectrum. It’s just a place that we should try to get back to.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jean.\nJEAN YUNG. Hi, Chair Powell. Jean Young with Market News. I just wanted to ask,\nwith all the events of the past two weeks, do you still see a possibility of a soft landing for the\nU.S. economy?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know it’s, it’s too early to say, really, whether these events have\nhad much of an effect. It’s hard for me to see how they would have helped the possibility—but I\nguess I would just say, it’s too early to say whether there really have been changes in that. You\nknow, the question will be how long this period is sustained. The longer it’s sustained, then the\ngreater will be the likely declines in—or tightening in credit standards, credit availability, so\nwe’ll just have to see. I do still think, though, that there’s a—there’s a pathway to that. I think\nthat pathway still exists and, you know, we’re certainly trying to find it.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nancy.\nNANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Hi, Chair Powell. Nancy Marshall-Genzer with\nMarketplace. Just wondering: How many financial institutions have been issued matters\nrequiring attention or matters requiring immediate attention citations at this point?\nPage 21 of 23\nMarch 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. How many? I don’t know. But those are serious—those are serious\nregulatory, in particular immediate attention, and that’s—and I guess there were six of them. So.\nNANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. And, and getting to the seriousness of it, how are you\ngoing to ensure that banks comply with these citations, take them seriously—how will you\nenforce them?\nCHAIR POWELL. That is a great question and is right in the heart of what the review\nwill be doing under Vice Chair Barr’s leadership. So that’s, I think that’s where—that’s what\nyou think about. What can we do to make sure that—but, again, that’s not for me to answer\ntoday.\nNANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Do you have specific thoughts on that?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well I, I—see, if I did, I wouldn’t share them because I, I really, you\nknow, this review is going on, and, you know, I want nothing other than us to find out what\nhappened and why, figure out what we can do to do better, and then implement those changes.\nThat’s all I want. It’s—For me to be giving you my half-formed, or partially informed, thoughts,\nit, you know, just isn’t appropriate. There’s a real serious review going on with, with people\nfrom all over the Federal Reserve System who are not connected to this, you know, to this work,\nnot connected to this bank, and under, again, Vice Chair Barr’s leadership, and I’m confident\nthat it will produce a satisfactory result.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Okay, we’ll go to Jennifer for the last question.\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. Thank you, Chair Powell. Jennifer Schonberger with\nYahoo Finance. Curious—how do you view financial conditions right now? If credit becomes\nexpensive enough, choking off growth, as you said you’re watching for, would that situation\nwarrant a rate cut? What situation would warrant a rate cut? And have the bank failures\nPage 22 of 23\nMarch 22, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nprompted any discussion around changing the implementation of the balance sheet runoff?\nThank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So we haven’t really talked about changing the balance sheet\nimplementation—that’s not something we’ve discussed yet. As I mentioned, we’re always\nwilling to change that if we conclude that it’s appropriate, but we’re really not seeing any signs\nthere. Sorry, then the question before that was, just give me a—\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. Curious how you view financial conditions now and, if\ncredit were to tighten enough, if that would prompt a rate cut.\nCHAIR POWELL. So financial conditions seem to have tightened—and probably by\nmore than the traditional indexes say, because traditional indexes are focused a lot on [interest]\nrates and [prices of] equities, and they don’t necessarily capture lending conditions. So we think\nthat, though. So there are other measures which, if they’re focused on, you know—bank lending\nconditions and things like that—they show some more tightening. The question for us, though,\nis, how significant will that be and how, you know—what will be the extent of it and what will\nbe the duration of it? And then—and then, you know, once you have—once you know that,\nthere’s a fair amount of research about how that, with broad uncertainty bands—how that works\nits way into the economy [and] over what period of time. And so, you know, we’ll be looking to\nsee the first part of that—like how serious is this, and does it look like it’s going to be sustained,\nand if it is, you know, it could easily have a significant macroeconomic effect, and we would\nfactor that into our policy decisions. I mentioned with rate cuts, rate cuts are not in our base\ncase, and, you know, so that’s all I have to say. Thank you very much.\nPage 23 of 23"

    "press_conf": "May 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nTranscript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference\nMay 3, 2023\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. Before discussing today’s meeting, let me comment\nbriefly on recent developments in the banking sector. Conditions in that sector have broadly\nimproved since early March, and the U.S banking system is sound and resilient. We will\ncontinue to monitor conditions in the sector. We are committed to learning the right lessons\nfrom this episode and will work to prevent events like these from happening again. As a first\nstep in that process, last week we released Vice Chair for Supervision Barr’s Review of the\nFederal Reserve’s Supervision and Regulation of Silicon Valley Bank. The review’s findings\nunderscore the need to address our rules and supervisory practices to make for a stronger and\nmore resilient banking system, and I am confident that we will do so.\nFrom the perspective of monetary policy, our focus remains squarely on our dual\nmandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My\ncolleagues and I understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly\ncommitted to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal. Price stability is the\nresponsibility of the Federal Reserve. Without price stability, the economy does not work for\nanyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong\nlabor market conditions that benefit all.\nToday, the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by ¼ percentage point. Since early last\nyear, we have raised interest rates by a total of 5 percentage points in order to attain a stance of\nmonetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time. We are\nalso continuing to reduce our securities holdings. Looking ahead, we will take a data-dependent\napproach in determining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate. I will\nPage 1 of 25\nMay 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nhave more to say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic\ndevelopments.\nThe U.S. economy slowed significantly last year, with real GDP rising at a below-trend\npace of 0.9 percent. The pace of economic growth in the first quarter of this year continued to be\nmodest, at 1.1 percent, despite a pickup in consumer spending. Activity in the housing sector\nremains weak, largely reflecting higher mortgage, mortgage rates. Higher interest rates and\nslower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.\nThe labor market remains very tight. Over the first three months of the year, job gains\naveraged 345,000 jobs per month. The unemployment rate remained very low in March, at\n3.5 percent. Even so, there are some signs that supply and demand in the labor market are\ncoming back into better balance. The labor force participation rate has moved up in recent\nmonths, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years. Nominal wage growth has sown—\nshown some signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year. But overall, labor\ndemand still substantially exceeds the supply of available workers.\nInflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. Over the 12 months\nending in March, total PCE prices rose 4.2 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy\ncategories, core PCE prices rose 4.6 percent. Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle\nof last year. Nonetheless, inflation pressures continue to run high, and the process of getting\ninflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go. Despite elevated inflation, longer-term\ninflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of\nhouseholds, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.\nThe Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by, by our mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware\nPage 2 of 25\nMay 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthat high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for\nthose least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We\nare highly attentive to the risks that high inflation pose—poses to both sides of our mandate, and\nwe are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.\nAt today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by\n¼ percentage point, bringing the target range to 5 to 5¼ percent. And we’re continuing to [carry\nout] the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings.\nWith today’s action, we have raised interest rates by 5 percentage points in a little more\nthan a year. We are seeing the effects of our policy tightening on demand in the most interest\nrate–sensitive sectors of the economy, particularly housing and investment. It will take time,\nhowever, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation.\nIn addition, the economy is likely to face further headwinds from tighter credit\nconditions. Credit conditions had already been tightening over the past year or so in response to\nour policy actions and a softer economic outlook. But the strains that emerged in the banking\nsector in early March appear to be resulting in even tighter credit conditions for households and\nbusinesses. In turn, these tighter credit conditions are likely to weigh on economic activity,\nhiring, and inflation. The extent of these effects remains uncertain.\nIn light of these uncertain headwinds, along with the monetary policy restraint we have\nput in place, our future policy actions will depend on how events unfold. In determining the\nextent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over\ntime, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags\nwith which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial\ndevelopments. We, we will make that determination meeting by meeting, based on the totality of\nPage 3 of 25\nMay 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nincoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation. And we\nare prepared to do more if greater monetary policy restraint is warranted.\nWe remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep\nlonger-term inflation expectations well anchored. Reducing inflation is likely to require a period\nof below-trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions. Restoring price stability\nis essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer\nrun.\nTo conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and\nbusinesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the\nFed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.\nThank you. I look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thanks. Jeanna.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Hi. Jeanna Smialek, New York Times. Thanks for taking our\nquestions. I wonder if you could tell us whether we should read the statement today as a\nsuggestion that the Committee is prepared to pause interest rate increases in June. And I also\nwonder if the Fed staff has in any way revised their forecast for a mild recession from the March\nminutes and, if so, what a recession like what they’re envisioning would look and feel like when\nit comes to, for example, the unemployment rate.\nCHAIR POWELL. So, taking your question—of course, today our decision was to raise\nthe federal funds rate by 25 basis points. A, a decision on a pause was not made today. You will\nhave noticed that in the—in the statement from March, we had a sentence that said the\nCommittee anticipates that some additional policy firming may be appropriate. That sentence is,\nis not in, in the statement anymore. We took that out, and instead we’re saying that, in\nPage 4 of 25\nMay 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ndetermining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate to return inflation\nto 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account certain factors. So we—that’s a—\nthat’s a meaningful change that we’re no longer saying that we anticipate. And so we’ll be\ndriven by incoming data meeting by meeting. And, you know, we’ll approach that question at\nthe June meeting. So the—the staff’s forecast is—so let me say—start by saying that that’s not\nmy own most likely case, which is really that, that the economy will continue to grow at, at a\nmodest rate this year. And I think that’s—so different people on the Committee have different\nforecasts. That’s, that’s my own assessment of the most likely path. [The] staff produces its\nown forecast, and it’s independent of the forecasts of, of the participants, which include the\nGovernors and the Reserve Bank presidents, of course. And we think this is a healthy thing—\nthat the, the staff is writing down what they really think. They’re not especially influenced by\nwhat the Governors think, and vice versa. The Governors are not taking what the staff says and\njust writing that down. So it’s actually good that the, the staff and individual participants can\nhave different perspectives. So, broadly, the forecast was for a mild recession, and by that I\nwould characterize as one in which the rise in unemployment is smaller than is—has been typical\nin modern-era recessions. I wouldn’t want to characterize the staff’s forecast for this meeting.\nWe’ll, we’ll leave that to the minutes—but broadly, broadly similar to that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Rachel.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Thank you, Chair Powell. Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.\nThanks for taking our questions. I’m wondering if you can talk about the account of possible\neffects of a debt-limit standoff. You’ve said repeatedly that the ceiling must be raised, but do\nyou see any economics effects of even getting close to a default? And what type of situation\nwould that look like?\nPage 5 of 25\nMay 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. So I wouldn’t want to speculate specifically, but I will say this:\nThese are fiscal policy matters, for starters, and they’re, they’re for Congress and the\nAdministration—for the elected parts of the government to deal with. And they’re really\nconsigned to them. From our standpoint, I would just say this: It’s essential that the debt ceiling\nbe raised in a timely way, so that the U.S. government can pay all of its bills when they’re due.\nA failure to do that would be unprecedented. We’d be in uncharted territory, and the—and the\nconsequences to the U.S. economy would be highly uncertain and could, could be quite\na[d]verse. So I’ll just leave it there. We, we don’t give advice to either side. We just would\npoint out that it—that it’s very important that this be done. And the, the other point I’ll make\nabout that, though, is that no one should assume that the Fed can protect the economy from the\npotential, you know, short- and long-term effects of a failure to pay our bills on time. We, we—\nit’s, it would be so uncertain that it’s just as important that, that this—we never get to a place\nwhere we’re actually talking about or even having a situation where the U.S. government’s not\npaying its bills.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. And just a follow-up. Was discussion around the uncertainty of a\npossible standoff—did that affect today’s monetary policy decision at all?\nCHAIR POWELL. I wouldn’t say that it did. It was—of course, it’s something that\ncame up. We talk a lot about risks to the—to the outlook, and that will—that come up. A\nnumber of people did raise that as a risk to the outlook. I wouldn’t say that it was important in\ntoday’s monetary policy decision.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Mr. Chairman, can you—oh, thank you. Steve Liesman, CNBC.\nCan you tell us what the Federal Reserve Board did in the wake of that February presentation\nPage 6 of 25\nMay 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nwhere you were informed that Silicon Valley Bank and other banks were experiencing interest\nrate risks? And can you tell me what supervisory actions you’ve done in the wake of the recent\nbank failures to make sure that banks are currently appropriately managing interest rate risk?\nAnd kind of part 3, but it’s all the same question here—do, do you still think this separation\nprinciple that monetary policy and supervision can be handled with different tools? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So the February 14 presentation—I didn’t remember it very\nwell. But now, of course, I’ve gone back and looked at it very carefully. I did remember it. And\nwhat it was was a general presentation. It was an informational briefing of the whole Board—\nthe entire Board. I think all members were there. And it was about interest rate risk in the banks\nand, and lots of data. And there was one page on Silicon Valley Bank, which talked about, you\nknow, the amount of losses they—or mark-to-market losses they had in their portfolio. There\nwas nothing in it about—that I recall, anyway, about, about the risk of a bank run. So it was—I\nthink the takeaway was, they were going away to do a—an assessment, a vertical—sorry,\nhorizontal assessment of, of banks. It wasn’t—it, it wasn’t presented as an urgent or alarming\nsituation. It was presented as a—as an informational, nondecisional kind of a thing. And I\nthought it was a good presentation and, and, as I said, did remember it.\nIn terms of what we’re doing—of course, I think banks themselves are, are—many, many\nbanks are now, are attending to liquidity and taking opportunity now, really, since, since the\nevents of, of early March, to build liquidity. And you asked about the separation principle. I—\nyou know, like so many things, it, it’s very useful. But, you know, ultimately, it has its limits. I\nmean, I, I think in this particular case, we have found that the monetary policy tools and the\nfinancial stability tools are not in conflict. They’re both—they’re working well together. We’ve\nused our, our financial stability tools to support banks through our lending facilities. And, at the\nPage 7 of 25\nMay 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nsame time, we’ve been able to use our monetary policy tools to foster maximum employment\nand price stability.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Mr. Chairman, I’m sorry. I don’t mean to be argumentative, but\nthe, the staff report said, “SVB . . . has significant interest rate risk.” It said, “Interest rate risk\nmeasurement[s] . . . failed” at SVB. And it said, “Banks with large unrealized losses face\nsignificant safety and soundness risks.” Why was that not alarming?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, I mean, I didn’t say it wasn’t alarming. It was—they’re\npointing out something that they’re working on and that they’re on the case—that, that, you\nknow, that—I’m not sure whether they mentioned—I think they did, actually. They mentioned\nthat they had taken regulatory action matter—or supervisory action in the form of matters\nrequiring attention. So I think that was also in the presentation. I think it was to say: Yes, this is\na bank, and there are many other banks that are experiencing this—these things, and we’re on the\ncase.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Chair Powell. I wanted to ask—obviously, with the recent\nbank turmoil, we’ve seen multiple banks buy other banks. And I was just curious whether you\nthink that further consolidation in the banking sector would increase or decrease financial\nstability and whether you have any concerns about the biggest bank in the U.S. getting even\nlarger.\nCHAIR POWELL. So I, you know, we certainly don’t—and I don’t have an agenda to\nfurther consolidate banks. There’s been—consolidation has been a factor in the U.S. banking\nindustry really since interstate banking and before that even—it goes back more than 30 years.\nYou—when I was in the government a while back, I think there were 14,000 banks. Now there\nPage 8 of 25\nMay 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nare 4,000 and change. So that’s, that’s going on. I personally have long felt that having small-,\nmedium-, and large-size banks is a, a great part of our banking system. You know, the\ncommunity banks serve particular customers very well; regional banks serve very important\npurposes, and the various kinds of G-SIBs do as well. So I think it’s healthy to have a, you\nknow, an arrange—a range of different kinds of banks doing different things. I think that’s a\npositive thing. Is it a financial—so I would just say, in terms of J.P. Morgan buying First\nRepublic, the FDIC really runs the process of closing and selling a closed bank completely.\nThat, that is their role, so I really don’t have a comment on, on that process. As you know,\nthere’s an exception to the deposit cap for a failing bank. So it was legitimate. And I think the\nFDIC, I believe, is bound by law to take the bid that is the least-cost bid. So I would assume\nthat’s what they did.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. So do you have any concerns about the fact that they’re, they’re\ngetting larger in general?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I, I think it’s probably good policy that we, we don’t want the\nlargest banks doing big acquisitions. That is the policy. And—but this is—this is an exception\nfor a failing bank. And I, I think it’s actually a good outcome for the banking system. It also\nwould have—would have been a good—a good outcome for the banking system had one of the\nregional banks bought, bought this company. And that could have been the outcome. But,\nultimately, we have to follow the law in our agencies, and the law is, it goes to the, the least-cost\nbid.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Now to Colby.\nCOLBY SMITH. Thank you. Colby Smith with the Financial Times. At the March\nmeeting, you mentioned that tightening of credit conditions from the recent bank stress could be\nPage 9 of 25\nMay 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nequal to one or more rate increases. So, given developments since then, how has your estimate\nchanged?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah. I think—I think I follow that up by saying, it’s, it’s quite\nimpossible to have a precise estimate of the words to that effect. But, in principle, that’s the\nidea. You know, when we—we’ve been raising interest rates, and that raises the price of credit,\nand that, in a sense, restricts credit in the economy, working through the price mechanism. And,\nyou know, when banks raise their credit standards, that can also make credit tighter in a kind of\nbroadly similar way. It isn’t—it isn’t possible to make a kind of clean translation between one\nand the other, although firms are trying that and, you know, we’re trying it. But, ultimately, we\nhave to be—we have to be honest and humble about our ability to make a precise assessment.\nSo it does complicate the task of achieving, you know, a sufficiently restrictive stance. But I\nthink, conceptually, though, we think that, you know, interest rates—in principle, we won’t have\nto raise the rates quite as high as we would have had this not happened. The extent of that is so\nhard to predict because we don’t know how persistent these, these effects will be. We don’t\nknow how large they’ll be and how long they’ll take to be transmitted. But that’s, that’s what\nwe’ll be watching carefully to find out.\nCOLBY SMITH. Just to quickly follow up—what does it suggest about the scope for the\nCommittee to pause rate increases perhaps as early as next month, even if the data remains\nstrong then, if, if it’s having some kind of substitute effect?\nCHAIR POWELL. It’s that—this is just something that we have to factor in as we—as\nwe want to find ourselves. So I guess I would say it this way: The assessment of, of the extent\nto which additional policy firming may be appropriate is going to be an ongoing one, meeting by\nmeeting, and we’re going to be looking at the factors that I mentioned that—they’re listed in, in\nPage 10 of 25\nMay 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthe statement, the obvious factors. That’s, that’s the way we’re going to be thinking about it.\nAnd that’s really all we can do. As I say, it does complicate—we, we have, you know, a broad\nunderstanding of monetary policy. Credit tightening is a different thing. There’s a lot of\nliterature on that. But translating it into, into rate hikes is uncertain, let’s say—it adds even\nfurther uncertainty. Nonetheless, we’ll be able to see what’s happening with credit conditions—\nwhat’s happening with lending. We get—there’s a lot of data on that. And, you know, we’ll,\nwe’ll factor that into our decisionmaking.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Howard.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Howard Schneider with Reuters. Thank you. So, noting that\nthe statement dropped the reference to “sufficiently” restricted—“restrictive,” I was wondering,\ngiven your baseline outlook, whether you feel this current rate of 5 to 5¼ percent is, in fact,\nsufficiently restrictive.\nCHAIR POWELL. That’s going to be an ongoing assessment. We’re going to need data\nto accumulate on that—not an assessment that we’ve made, as—that, that would mean we think\nwe’ve reached that point. And I just think it’s, it’s not possible to say that with confidence now.\nBut, nonetheless, you, you will know that the Summary of Economic Projections from the March\nmeeting showed that in—at that point in time, that the median participant thought that this was—\nthis was the appropriate level of the—of the ultimate high level of rates. We don’t know that.\nWe’ll revisit that at the June meeting. And that’s—you know, we’re just going to have to—\nbefore we really declare that, I think we’re going to have to see data accumulating and, and, you\nknow, make that—as I mentioned, it’s an ongoing assessment.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. I have a follow-up on credit. Could you give us a sense of\nwhat the SLOOS survey indicated? It was already, I think, 40, 45 percent of banks were\nPage 11 of 25\nMay 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ntightening credit as of the, the last survey. What did this one show, and how did that weigh into\nyour deliberations?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we’re going to release the results of this SLOOS on May 8, in line\nwith our usual time frame. And I would just say that the SLOOS is broadly consistent, when you\nsee it, with how we and others have been thinking about the situation and what we’re seeing\nfrom other sources. You will have seen the Beige Book and listened to the various earnings calls\nthat indicate that midsize banks have—some of them had been tightening their lending standards.\nBanking data will show that lending has continued to grow, but the pace has been slowing really\nsince the second half of last year.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Nick.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos, Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, the argument\naround the end of last year and the beginning of this year to slow down the pace of increases was\nto give yourself time to study the effects of those moves. After the bank failures in March, as\nyou’ve discussed, the Fed staff projected a recession starting later this year. So my question is\nwhy it was necessary to raise interest rates today. Or, put, put differently: If the whole point of\nslowing down the pace was to see the effects of your moves, and now you’ve, for the last two\nmeetings, been seeing the effects of those moves, why did the Committee feel it was necessary to\nkeep moving?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, we—the reason is that we—again, with our monetary policy\nwe’re try—trying to reach and then—and then stay at a, for an extended period, a level of\npolicy—a policy stance that’s sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2 percent over\ntime. And, you know, that’s what we’re trying to do with our—with our tool. I think slowing\ndown was the right move. I, I think it’s enabled us to see more data, and it will continue to do\nPage 12 of 25\nMay 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nso. So I, I—you know, we really—you know, we have to balance. We always have to balance\nthe risk of not doing enough and, and not getting inflation under control against the risk of\nmaybe slowing down economic activity too much. And we thought that this rate hike, along\nwith the meaningful change in, in our policy statement, was the right way to balance that.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. And just to follow up, you know, what you said in response to\nHoward’s question—you’ll need data to accumulate to determine if this is a sufficiently\nrestrictive stance. Does that data need to accumulate, or could it accumulate over a longer period\nthan a six-week intermeeting cycle?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah. I mean, as I mentioned, I would just say that this assessment\nwill be an ongoing one. You—you know, you can’t—with, with economic data, you, you\ncan’t—you’ve, you’ve seen—take inflation for a minute. Look, look back. We’ve seen inflation\ncome down—move back up two or three times since March of 2021. We’ve seen inflation have\na few months of coming down and then come right back up. So I think you’re going to want to\nsee that—you know, that a few months of data will, will persuade you that you’ve—that you’ve\ngot this right, kind of thing. And, you know, we, we have the luxury: We’ve raised 500 basis\npoints. I think that policy is tight. I think real rates are probably—that you can calculate them\nmany different ways. But one way is to look at the nominal rate and then subtract a, a reasonable\nestimate of, of, let’s say, one-year inflation, which might be 3 percent. So you’ve got 2 percent\nreal rates. That’s meaningfully above what most people would—many people, anyway, would,\nwould assess as, you know, the neutral rate. So policy is tight. And you see that in interest—\ninterest-sensitive activities. And you also begin to see it more and more in, in other activities.\nAnd if you—if you put the—you put the credit tightening on top of that and the QT that’s, that’s\nPage 13 of 25\nMay 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nongoing, I think, I think you feel like, you know, we’re, we may not be far off—we’re possibly\neven at—that level.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Edward.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you very much, Chair Powell. Edward Lawrence with\nFox Business. So if the Federal Reserve gets down to the 3 percent inflation, as the projections\nshow, at the end of this year or close to it, would it be okay for you for a prolonged period of\n3 percent inflation and hoping for some outside event to move down to 2 percent target?\nCHAIR POWELL. Look—I think we’re always going to have 2 percent as our, our\ntarget. We’re always going to be focusing on getting there.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. You would be okay with a prolonged 3 percent?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, it’s—let me just say, that’s not what we’re looking for.\nWe’re looking for inflation going down to 2 percent over time. I mean, we—that’s, that’s not a\nquestion that’s in front of us, and it would depend on so many other things. But, ultimately,\nwe’re not looking to get to 3 percent and then drop our tools. We have a, a goal of getting to\n2 percent. We think it’s going to take some time. We don’t think it’ll be a smooth process.\nAnd, you know, I think we’re going to—we’re going to need to stay at this for a while.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. How does the other side of the mandate—the jobs side—once\nyou get to 3 percent, going from 3 to 2, how does the other side of the mandate balance?\nCHAIR POWELL. I think they, they—you know, they, they will both matter equally at\nthat point. Right now, you have a labor market that’s still extraordinarily tight. You still got\n1.6 job openings, even with the lower job openings number, for every unemployed person. We\ndo see some evidence of softening in labor market conditions. But, overall, you’re near a\n50-year low in unemployment. Wages—you all will have seen that the wage number from late\nPage 14 of 25\nMay 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nlast week, and it’s—whenever it was. And, you know, it’s, it’s a couple of percentage points\nabove what would be—what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time. So we do\nsee some softening; we see new labor supply coming in. These are very positive developments.\nBut the labor market is very, very strong, whereas inflation is, you know, running high—well\nabove our—well above our goal. And right now, we need to be focusing on bringing inflation\ndown. Fortunately, we’ve been able to do that so far without unemployment going up.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Matt.\nMATTHEW BOESLER. Hi, Chair Powell. Matthew Boesler with Bloomberg News.\nSo, many analysts noted at the time of the March FOMC meeting that at least half of Fed\nofficials’ projections did imply or seemed to imply that a recession was in their baseline forecast\nas well, given the strong first-quarter GDP tracking estimates. And so I’m just wondering if you\ncould kind of elaborate on, you know, why you’re optimistic that a recession can be avoided,\ngiven that that’s the Fed staff’s forecast—possibly also the broader Committee’s forecast as\nwell—and, and also, of course, most private-sector forecasters’.\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah. I don’t think—you know, I know what’s printed in the\nSummary of Economic Projections and all that. I don’t think you can deduce exactly what you\nsaid about what participants think, because you don’t know what they were thinking for first-\nquarter GDP at that point. They could have been thinking about a fairly low number. Anyway,\nin any case, I’ll just say, I, I continue to think that it’s possible that this time is really different.\nAnd the reason is, there’s just so much excess demand, really, in the labor market. It’s, it’s\ninteresting, as, you know, we’ve raised rates by 5 percentage points in 14 months, and the\nunemployment rate is 3½ percent, pretty much where it was—even lower than where it was\nwhen we started. So job openings are still very, very high. We see—by surveys and much,\nPage 15 of 25\nMay 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nmuch [other] evidence—that, that conditions are cooling gradually. But it’s—it really is\ndifferent. You know, it wasn’t supposed to be possible for job openings to decline by as much of\nthe—as they’ve declined without unemployment going up. Well, that’s what we’ve seen. So\nwe—there are no promises in this. But it just seems that, to me, that it’s possible that we can\ncontinue to have a cooling in the labor market without having the big increases in unemployment\nthat have gone with many, you know, prior episodes. Now, that would be against history. I, I\nfully appreciate that. That would be against the, the pattern. But I do think that it—that this, that\nthe situation in the labor market, with so much excess demand, yet, you know, wages are\nactually—wages have been moving down. Wage increases have been moving down, and that’s a\ngood sign—down to a more sustainable level. So I think that—I think it’s still possible. I—you\nknow, I think, you know, the, the case of, of avoiding a recession is, in my view, more likely\nthan that of having, having a recession. But it’s not—it’s not that the case of having a recession\nis—I don’t rule that out, either. It’s, it’s possible that we will have what I hope would be a mild\nrecession.\nMATTHEW BOESLER. The Committee also noted in March that wage growth was still\nwell above levels that would be consistent with 2 percent inflation. Do you see that as well?\nAnd could you kind of explain, you know, how you come to that judgment?\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So we look at a range of wage, wage measures. And then\nthat’s in nominal. And then—so you assume wages should be equal to productivity increases\nplus inflation. And so you can—you can look at, you know, the employment compensation\nindex, average hourly earnings, the Atlanta wage tracker, compensation per hour—basically,\nthose four and many others. And you can—you can look at, at what the—what they would have\nto run at over a long period of time for that to be consistent with 2 percent inflation. They can\nPage 16 of 25\nMay 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ndeviate. You know, corporate margins can go up and down. And there is a feature of long\nexpansions where they do go down—where labor gets a bigger share toward later, later in a\nrecession—sorry, later in an expansion. So, yeah. The, the—you know, and we calculate those,\nand you have to take the precision with a degree of—a degree of salt. But I would say that what\nthey will show is that, you know, if, if the—if wages are running at 5 percent, 3 percent is closer\nto where they need to be. Wage increases and closer to 3 percent, roughly, is what it would take\nto get—to be consistent with inflation over a longer period of time. I—by the way, I don’t want\nto—I do not think that wages are the principal driver of inflation. You’re asking me a very\nspecific question. I think there are many things. I think wages and prices tend to move together.\nAnd it’s very hard to say what’s causing what. But, you know, I’ve never said that, you know,\nthat—that wages are really the principal driver, because I don’t think that’s really right.\nCHRIS RUGABER. Great. Chris Rugaber at Associated Press. Well, you mentioned\nprofit margins. Those have expanded—did expand sharply during this inflationary period. And\nwhile there are some signs that they are starting to decline, many economists note they haven’t\nfallen as much as might be expected, given that we’re seeing at least some pullback among\nconsumer spending. So, speaking of causes of inflation, do you see expanded profit margins as a\ndriver of higher prices? And if so, would you expect them to narrow soon and, and contribute to\nreduced inflation in the coming months?\nCHAIR POWELL. So higher profits and higher margins are what happens when you\nhave an imbalance between supply and demand: too much demand, not enough supply. And\nwe’ve been in a situation in many parts of the economy where, where supply has been fixed or,\nor not flexible enough. And so, you know, the way the market clears is through higher prices.\nSo to get, I, I think—as goods pipelines have, have gotten, you know, back to normal so that we\nPage 17 of 25\nMay 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ndon’t have the long waits and the shortages and that kind of thing—I think you will see inflation\ncome down. And you’ll see—you’ll see corporate margins coming down as a result of return of\nfull competition, where there’s enough supply to meet demand. And then it’s—then it’s, then\nyou’re really back to full competition. That’s—that would be the dynamic I would expect.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Michael.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee for Bloomberg Radio and Television. Can you\ntell us something about what your policy reaction function is—your policy framework is going\nforward? When you look at the economy at the next meeting, are you looking at incoming data,\nwhich is, by definition, backward looking? Are you going to be forecasting what you think is\ngoing to happen? Are you ruling out the rate cuts that the market has priced in?\nCHAIR POWELL. I didn’t catch the last part. Rolling?\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Markets have priced in rate cuts by the end of the year. Do you\nrule that out?\nCHAIR POWELL. Oh, yes. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Okay, I got it. So, what are we looking\nat? I mean, we look at a combination of data and, and forecasts. Of course, the whole idea is\nto—is to create a good forecast based on what you see in the data. So we’re always, always\nlooking at both. You know, and it will—of course, it’ll be the obvious things. It’ll be readings\non inflation. It’ll be readings on wages, on economic growth, on the labor market, and all of\nthose many things. I think a particular focus for us going—now, over the past six, seven weeks\nnow and going forward is going to be, what’s happening with credit tightening? Are small and\nmedium-sized banks tightening credit standards, and, and is that having an effect on, on loans, on\nlending? And, you know, so we can begin to assess how that fits in with monetary policy.\nThat’ll, that’ll be an important thing. I just—you know, we’ll be looking at everything. It’s—\nPage 18 of 25\nMay 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nagain, I would just point out, we’ve raised rates by 5 percentage points. We are shrinking the\nbalance sheet. And now we have credit conditions tightening—not just in the normal way, but\nperhaps a little bit more, due to what’s happened. And we have to factor all of that in and, and\nmake our assessment of—you know, of whether our policy stance is sufficiently restrictive. And\nwe have to do that in a world where policy works with long and variable lags. So this is\nchallenging. But, you know, we, we will make our best assessment, and that’s what we think.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. What about the idea of rate cuts?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah. So we on the Committee have a—have a view that inflation is\ngoing to come down—not so quickly, but it’ll take some time. And in that world, if that forecast\nis broadly right, it would not be appropriate and—to cut rates, and we won’t cut rates. If you\nhave a different forecast and, you know, markets—or have been, from time to time, pricing in,\nyou know, quite rapid reductions in inflation, you know, we’d, we’d factor that in. But that’s not\nour forecast. And, of course, the history of the last two years has been very much that inflation\nmoves down. Particularly now, if you look at nonhousing services, it really, really hasn’t moved\nmuch. And it’s quite stable. And, you know, so we think we’ll have to—demand will have to\nweaken a little bit, and labor market conditions, conditions may have to soften a bit more to\nbegin to see progress there. And, again, in that world, it wouldn’t be—it wouldn’t be appropriate\nfor us to cut rates.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Courtenay.\nCOURTENAY BROWN. Courtenay Brown from Axios. I’m curious how you view the\nrole of the overnight reverse repo facility in the context of the current banking stress. Do you\nthink it’s contributing to the stress by making it more attractive for money market funds to\nPage 19 of 25\nMay 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ncompete with banks for deposits? And did the Committee discuss any changes to the structure of\nthe facility? Or do you see that being put on the table in the future? Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So we looked at that very carefully, as you would imagine.\nAnd, you know, the—it’s, it’s really not contributing, we don’t think, now. It hasn’t actually\nbeen growing. You know, it moved up—moved down and then moved back up to where it was.\nWhat happened in the—when, when there were the big deposit flows, which, by the way, have\nreally stabilized now—what happened was, institutional investors took their uninsured deposits\nand put them in government money market funds, which bought paper from the Federal Home\nLoan Banks and things like that. Over the course of, of maybe the last year, retail investors had\nbeen gradual—as they do in every tightening cycle, they’ve been gradually moving their deposits\ninto higher-yielding places such as CDs and, and other things, including money market funds.\nSo that’s a gradual process that is quite natural and happens during a, a tightening cycle. What\nwas unusual, really, was the institutional investors moving their uninsured deposits and\nspreading them around and things like that. But it doesn’t seem to have had any—any effect\noverall on the overnight repo facility. That is really there to, to help us keep rates where they’re\nsupposed to be, and it’s, it’s serving that purpose very well.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Sarah.\nSARAH EWALL-WICE. Sarah Ewall-Wice, CBS News. I want to go back to the debt\nceiling for a moment. I know you talked about that in terms of fiscal policy, but can you just\nspeak towards what the impact of a default would mean for Americans across the country, the\nmarkets, and borrowing?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah. I would just say, it’s —I, I don’t really think we should be—\nwe shouldn’t even be talking about a world in which the U.S. doesn’t pay its bills. It just—it just\nPage 20 of 25\nMay 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nshouldn’t be a thing. And, and again, I would just say, we don’t—no one should assume that the\nFed can do—can really protect the economy and the financial system and our reputation globally\nfrom, from the damage that such, such an event might inflict.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Scott.\nSCOTT HORSLEY. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Scott Horsley for NPR. In his report last\nweek, Vice Chair Barr identified a couple of the factors that he thought contributed to the\nregulatory—or the supervisory lapses at Silicon Valley Bank: a policy change in 2019 to exempt\nall but the biggest banks from strict scrutiny and also what he called a sort of cultural shift\ntowards less aggressive oversight. You were here in 2019. Do you share that view, and what\nwould it take to get the, the stronger oversight that you and he said in your release would be\nnecessary?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I, I didn’t—I didn’t take part in creating the report or doing the\nwork, but I do—I have read it, of course. And I find it persuasive. I mean, I would say it this\nway: A, a very large—a large bank, not a very large bank—a large bank failed quite suddenly\nand unexpectedly in a way that threatened to spread contagion into the financial system. I think\nthe only thing that, that I’m really focused on is to understand what went wrong, what happened,\nand, and identify what we need to do to address that. Some of that is—may, it may just have\nbeen technology evolving. You know, we have to keep up with all that. But some of it may be\nour policies, and—supervisory and regulatory, whatever. What our job is now is, identify those\nthings and implement them. And that’s kind of the only thing I care about is—and I think—I\nfeel like I am accountable for doing everything I can to make sure that that happens.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Evan.\nPage 21 of 25\nMay 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nEVAN RYSER. Thank you. Evan Ryser with MNI Market News. Chair Powell, are we\nin the early stage or nearing the end stage of the banking turmoil among regional banks? And,\nsecondly, do you still have a bias to tighten rates? Is that what the statement is saying?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I guess I would—I guess I would say it this way. There were\nthree large banks, really, from the very beginning that were at the heart of the stress that we—\nthat we saw in early March, the severe period of stress. Those have now all been resolved, and\nall the depositors have been protected. I think that the resolution and sale of, of First Republic\nkind of draws a line under that period of—is an important step toward drawing a line under that\nperiod of, of severe stress. Okay. I also think we are very focused on what’s happening with\ncredit availability, particularly, you know, with what you saw in the—in the Beige Book, and\nyou will see in the SLOOS, is, is small and medium—medium-sized, small and medium-sized\nbanks who are feeling that they need to tighten credit standards—build liquidity. What’s going\nto be the macroeconomic effect of that? More broadly, we, we will continue to very carefully\nmonitor what’s going on in the banking system, and we’ll factor that assessment into our\ndecisions in an important way, going forward.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Okay. Greg.\nGREG ROBB. Thank you, Fed Chairman. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. I just\nwondered if you’ve done any reflection on, on your own actions during this crisis and leading up\nto it over the last—since you’ve been Fed Chairman, I think I’ve heard you say a couple of times\nthat you deferred to the Vice Chair for Supervision. Do you think that was the right way to go\nabout this? And, yeah, comments on that. Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So let me say, first of all, I’ve been Chair of the Board for\nfive-plus years now, and I fully recognize that we made mistakes. I think we’ve learned some\nPage 22 of 25\nMay 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nnew things as well, and we need to do better. And, as I mentioned, I thought the report was\nunflinching and appropriately so. I welcome it. And I agree with and will support those\nrecommendations. And I do feel that I’m personally accountable to do what I can to foster\nmeasures that will address the problems. So, on, on the Vice Chair for Supervision, you know,\nthe place to start is, is the statutory role, which is quite unusual. The Vice Chair, it says, shall\ndeploy policy recommendations—“develop policy recommendations for the Board regarding\nsupervision and regulation of depository institution . . . companies . . . , and shall oversee the\nsupervision and regulation of such firms.” So this is Congress establishing a four-year term for\nsomeone else on the Board—not, not the Chair—as Vice Chair for Supervision who really gets\nto set the agenda for supervision and regulation for the Board of Governors. Congress wanted\nthat person to be—to have political accountability for developing that agenda. So the way it\nworks—the way it has worked in practice for me is, I’ve had a good working relationship. I give\nmy, my counsel, my input privately, and that’s—I offer that. And I have good conversations,\nand I try to contribute constructively. I respect the authority that Congress has deferred on that\nperson, including working with, with Vice Chair Barr and, and his predecessor. And I think\nthat’s the way it’s supposed to work, and that’s appropriate. I, I believe that’s what the law\nrequires. And, you know—but, but it isn’t—I wouldn’t say it’s a matter of complete deference.\nIt’s more, I have a—I have a role in, in presenting my views and discussing—having an\nintelligent discussion about what’s going on and why. And, you know, that’s, that’s my input.\nBut, ultimately, that person does get to set the agenda and gets to take things to the Board of\nGovernors and really, in supervision, has sole authority over supervision.\nGREG ROBB. Just wondered if you have any regrets? Or was there anything that, you\nknow—decisions that maybe you regret now in light of what’s happened?\nPage 23 of 25\nMay 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. I’ve had a few, sure. I mean, you know, who doesn’t look back and\nthink that you could have done things differently? But, honestly, you don’t—you don’t get to do\nthat. Again, my focus is on what—control the controllable. As one of my great mentors used to\nalways say, “Control the controllable.” What we control now is, make a fair assessment, learn\nthe right lessons, figure out what the fixes are, and implement them. And, and I think that, that\nVice Chair Barr’s report is an excellent first step in that, but we’ve got to follow through.\nMEGAN CASSELLA. Hi, there. Megan Cassella with Barron’s. Did the possibility of\npausing at this meeting come up at all, and how seriously was that considered? I’m curious if\nyou can give us any color as to whether there were any initial concerns about raising rates again\nor what those discussions entailed.\nCHAIR POWELL. So support for the 25 basis point rate increase was very strong across\nthe board. I would say there are a number of people—and, you know, you’ll see this in the\nminutes. I don’t want to try to do the head count in real time. But people did talk about pausing,\nbut not so much at this meeting, you know, that we’re—I mean, there’s a sense that we’re,\nwe’re—that, you know, we’re much closer to the end of this than to the beginning, that—you\nknow, as I mentioned, if you—if you add up all the tightening that’s going on through various\nchannels, it’s—we, we feel like we—you know, we’re getting close or, or maybe even there.\nBut that, again, that’s going to be an ongoing assessment. And, and we’re going to be looking at\nthose factors that we listed and—to determine whether there’s, there’s more to do.\nMEGAN CASSELLA. I’m curious, too, how to interpret that and, and the changes to the\nstatement. Is the bar higher now to raise rates at the next meeting, or would a strong jobs report\nor inflation print be enough to push the Fed to tighten again?\nPage 24 of 25\nMay 3, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. I don’t want to—I couldn’t—I couldn’t really say. I just think\nwe’re—I think we—look, I think we’ve moved a long way fairly quickly. And I think we can\nafford to look at the data and, and make a careful assessment.\nMICHELLE SMITH. And we’ll go to Nancy for the last question.\nNANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Hi, Chair Powell. Nancy Marshall-Genzer with\nMarketplace. You mentioned a few times about the lessons you’ve learned from the banking\ncrisis—that you would learn the right lessons. What are those lessons?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, I just would start with something that’s changed, really, which\nis this—the run on Silicon Valley Bank was out of keeping with the speed of runs through\nhistory. And that now needs to be reflected in some—in some way in regulation and in\nsupervision. It—we know—now that we know it’s possible, I think we didn’t—no one thought\nthat was possible. No one—I’m not aware of anybody thinking that this could happen so—quite\nso quickly. So I think that, you know, that will play through. I, I, you know—it will be up to\nVice Chair Barr to really take the lead in designing the ways to address that. But I think—I think\nthat’s one thing. I, I guess I would just say that. Then, you know—that we’re going to—\nobviously, we’re going to revisit [this]. It’s pretty clear we need—to me, anyways—clear that\nwe need to strengthen both supervision and regulations for banks of this size. And I’m, I’m\nthinking that we’re on the—on track to do that as well.\nNANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Can you be any more specific on stress testing or\nlooking at banks that have specific concentrations in certain parts of the economy?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah. That’s—see, that’s, that’s what Vice Chair Barr’s role really\nis, and he’ll take the lead on that.\nThank you.\nPage 25 of 25"

    "press_conf": "June 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nTranscript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference\nJune 14, 2023\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on\nour dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.\nWe understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to\nbringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal. Price stability is the responsibility of the\nFederal Reserve. Without price stability, the economy doesn’t work for anyone. In particular,\nwithout price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions\nthat benefit all.\nSince early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary\npolicy. We have raised our policy interest rate by 5 percentage points, and we’ve continued to\nreduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace. We’ve covered a lot of ground, and the full effects\nof our tightening have yet to be felt. In light of how far we’ve come in tightening policy, the\nuncertain lags with which monetary policy affects the economy, and potential headwinds from\ncredit tightening, today we decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to\nreduce our securities holdings. Looking ahead, nearly all Committee participants view it as\nlikely that some further rate increases will be appropriate this year to bring inflation down to\n2 percent over time. And I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing\neconomic developments.\nThe U.S. economy slowed significantly last year, and recent indicators suggest that\neconomic activity has continued to expand at a modest pace. Although growth in consumer\nspending has picked up this year, activity in the housing sector remains weak, largely reflecting\nhigher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be\nweighing on business fixed investment. Committee participants generally expect subdued\nPage 1 of 26\nJune 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ngrowth to continue. In our Summary of Economic Projections, the median projection has real\nGDP growth at 1.0 percent this year and 1.1 percent next year, well below the median estimate of\nthe longer-run normal growth rate.\nThe labor market remains very tight. Over the past three months, payroll job gains\naveraged a robust 283,000 jobs per month. The unemployment rate moved up but remained low\nin May at 3.7 percent. There are some signs that supply and demand in the labor market are\ncoming into better balance. The labor force participation rate has moved up in recent months,\nparticularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years. Nominal wage growth has shown signs of\neasing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year. While the jobs-to-workers gap has\ndeclined, labor demand still substantially exceeds the supply of available workers. FOMC\nparticipants expect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come into better balance\nover time, easing upward pressures on inflation. The median unemployment rate projection in\nthe SEP rises to 4.1 percent at the end of this year and 4.5 percent at the end of next year.\nInflation remains well above our longer-run 2 percent goal. Over the 12 months ending\nin April, total PCE proces—prices rose 4.4 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy\ncategories, core PCE prices rose 4.7 percent. In May, the 12-month change in the consumer\nprice index came in at 4 percent, and the change in the core, core CPI was 5.3 percent. Inflation\nhas moderated somewhat since the middle of last year. Nonetheless, inflation pressures continue\nto run high, and the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go.\nThe median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 3.2 percent this year, 2.5 percent next\nyear, and 2.1 percent in 2025. Core PCE inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy\nprices, is projected to run higher than total inflation, and the median projection has been revised\nin the SEP up to 3.9 percent this year. Despite elevated inflation, longer-term inflation\nPage 2 of 26\nJune 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nexpectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of\nhouseholds, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.\nThe Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and price—and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are\nacutely aware that high inflation imposes hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for\nthose least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We\nare highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we’re\nstrongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.\nAs I noted earlier, since early last year, we’ve raised our policy rate by 5 percentage\npoints. We have been seeing the effects of our policy tightening on demand in the most interest\nrate–sensitive sectors of the economy, especially housing and investment. It will take time,\nhowever, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation.\nThe economy is facing headwinds from tighter credit conditions for households and\nbusinesses, which are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. The extent of\nthese effects remains uncertain.\nIn light of how far we’ve come in tightening policy, the uncertain lags with which\nmonetary policy affects the economy, and potential headwinds from credit tightening, the\nCommittee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at\n5 to 5¼ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings.\nAs I noted earlier, nearly, nearly all Committee participants expect that it will be\nappropriate to raise interest rates somewhat further by the end of the year. But at this meeting,\nconsidering how far and how fast we’ve moved, we judged it prudent to hold the target range\nsteady to allow the Committee to assess additional information and its implications for monetary\nPage 3 of 26\nJune 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\npolicy. In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return\ninflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening\nof monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation,\nand economic and financial developments.\nIn our SEP, participants wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path\nfor the federal funds rate based on what each participant judges to be the most likely scenario\ngoing forward. If the economy evolves as projected, the median participant projects that the\nappropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 5.6 percent at the end of this year, 4.6 percent\nat the end of 2024, and 3.4 percent at the end of 2025. For the end of this year, the median\nprojection is ½ percentage point higher than in our March projections. I hasten to add, as\nalways, that these projections are not a Committee decision or plan. If the economy does not\nevolve as projected, the path for policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our maximum-\nemployment and price-stability goals. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by\nmeeting, based on the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for\neconomic activity and inflation, as well as the balance of risks.\nWe remain committed to bringing inflation—bringing inflation back down to our\n2 percent goal and to keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Reducing\ninflation is likely to require a period of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market\nconditions. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum\nemployment and stable prices over the longer run.\nTo conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and\nbusinesses across the country. Everything we do at the Fed is in service to our public mission.\nPage 4 of 26\nJune 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nWe will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.\nThank you. And I look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Colby.\nCOLBY SMITH. Thank you. Colby Smith with the Financial Times. I’m curious what\ngives you and the Committee the confidence that waiting will not be counterproductive at a time\nwhen the monthly pace of core inflation is still so elevated. Interest rate–sensitive sectors like\nhousing, while they’ve felt the drag of the past Fed actions, have started to recover in some\nregions, and financial conditions, you know, most recently were easing.\nCHAIR POWELL. So, I guess I would—I guess I would go back to the beginning of this\ntightening cycle to address that. So as we started our rate hikes early last year, we said there\nwere three issues that would need to be addressed kind of in sequence—that of the speed of\ntightening, the level to which rates would need to go, and then a period of time over which we’d\nneed to keep policy restrictive. So at the outset, going back 15 months, the key issue was how\nfast to move rates up, and we moved very quickly by historical standards. Then last December,\nafter four consecutive 75 basis point hikes, we moderated to a pace of 50—of a 50 basis point\nhike and then this year to three 25 basis point hikes at sequential meetings.\nSo it seemed to us to make obvious sense to moderate our rate hikes as we got closer to\nour destination. So the decision to consider not hiking at every meeting and ultimately to hold\nrates steady at this meeting, I would just say it’s a continuation of, of that process. The main\nissue that we’re focused on now is determining the extent of additional policy firming that may\nbe appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time—so that the pace of the increases and the\nultimate level of increases are separate variables, given how far it—we have come. It may make\nsense for rates to move higher but at a more moderate pace.\nPage 5 of 26\nJune 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nI want to stress one more thing—and that is that the Committee decision made today was\nonly about this meeting. We didn’t make any decision about going forward, including what\nwould happen at the next meeting, including—we did not decide or really discuss anything about\ngoing to an every-other-meeting kind of an approach or, or really any other approach. We really\nwere focused on what to do at this meeting.\nCOLBY SMITH. So there was no kind of initial debate about the possibility of July—\nany sense of the initial support at this stage for that move?\nCHAIR POWELL. So again, we didn’t—we didn’t make a decision about July. I mean,\nof course, it, it came up in the—in the meeting from time to time. But really, the focus was, was\non what to do today. I would say about, about July two things: (1) [the] decision hasn’t been\nmade, (2) I do expect that it will be a “live” meeting.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Howard.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thanks. Howard Schneider with Reuters. I was just\nwondering if you could help us understand the, the narrative here because it feels like there’s\nbeen a level shift in the—in the dots, stronger GDP, less of a hit to unemployment, slower\nprogress on inflation. And I’m wondering in, in this sort of—where’s the disinflation coming\nfrom?\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. The labor market’s going to be stronger it looks like—it’s not\ncoming from there. Demand’s not coming down all that fast. According to GDP—you’ve\ndoubled your, your estimate of GDP. So what’s the—what’s the narrative here? It seems like\nit’s getting more “immaculate,” rather than more messy.\nPage 6 of 26\nJune 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. So you’re, you’re right that the data came in, I would say, consistent\nwith, but on the high side of, expectations. And if you go back to the old—the former SEP—the\nlast SEP in March, you will see that [compared with March, projected real GDP] growth moved\nup. These are not huge moves, but growth estimates moved up a bit. Unemployment estimates\nmoved down a bit. Inflation estimates moved up a bit. And, you know, all three of those kind of\npoint in the same direction—which is, you know, that perhaps more [monetary policy] restraint\nwill be necessary than we had thought at the last meeting. So although the level, frankly, is, is\npretty—the level of 5.6 [percent] is pretty consistent, if you think about it, where the [expected]\nfederal funds rate was trading before the bank incidents of early March. So—but so we’ve kind\nof gone back to that. So your question is, where’s the—where’s the disinflation going to come\nfrom? And I, you know, I don’t think the story has really changed.\nWe—the Committee has consistently said and believed that the process of getting\ninflation down is going to be a gradual one. It’s going to take some time. And I think you go\nback to the—to the three-part framework for [analyzing] core PCE inflation—which is, we think,\nas good an indicator as you can have for where inflation is going forward. You start with goods.\nWith goods, we need to see continued healing in supply conditions—supply-side conditions.\nThey’ve definitely improved a substantial amount, but if you talk to people in business, they will\nsay it’s not back to where it was. So that’s, that’s one thing. And that should enable goods\nprices to continue—goods, goods inflation to continue to come down over time.\nIn terms of housing services inflation—that’s another big piece. And, and you are seeing\nthere that new rents in new, new leases are, are coming in at low levels. And it’s really a matter\nof time as that goes through the pipeline. In fact, I think any forecast that people are making\nright now about inflation coming down this year will, will contain a big dose of—this year and\nPage 7 of 26\nJune 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nnext year—will contain a, a good amount of, of disinflation [coming] from that source. And, and\nthat’s, again, probably going to come slower than we would [previously have expected it to come\ninto] effect.\nThat leaves, you know, the big sector, which is a little more than half, pardon me, of\nthe—of core PCE inflation that’s not housing services. And, you know, we see only the earliest\nsigns of disinflation there. It’s a sector—it’s a very broad and diverse sector. I would say [that,]\nin a number of the parts of that sector, the largest cost would be wage cost. It’s the service\nsector, so it’s, it’s heavily labor intensive. And I think many analysts would say that the key to\ngetting inflation down there is to have a continuing loosening in labor market conditions—which\nwe have seen. We have actually seen, you know—I go through a number of indicators\nsuggesting there has been some loosening in labor market conditions. We need to see that\ncontinue.\nI would almost say that the, the conditions that we need to see in place to get inflation\ndown are, are coming into place. And that would be [real GDP] growth meaningfully below\ntrend. It would be a labor market that’s loosening. It would be goods pipelines getting healthier\nand healthier and that kind of thing. There, there—the things are in place that we need to see,\nbut the process of that actually working on inflation is going to take some time.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nick.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, what’s the\nvalue in, in pausing and signaling future hikes versus just hiking now? I mean, not to be\nflippant, but I don’t lose weight just by buying a gym membership—I have to actually go to the\ngym. Sixteen of your colleagues put down a higher year-end ’23 rate today. A majority of you\nPage 8 of 26\nJune 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthink you’re going to have to go up by 50 basis points this year. So why not just rip off the\nBand-Aid and raise rates today?\nCHAIR POWELL. So the—first, I would say that the, the question of speed is a separate\nquestion from the question—from the—from, from that of level. Okay. So—and I think if you\nlook at the SEP, that is our estimate—our individual—it’s, it’s really a cumulation of our\nindividual estimates of how far to go. I, I mentioned how, how we got to those numbers. In\nterms of speed, it’s, it’s what I said at the beginning, which is, speed was very important last\nyear. As we get closer and closer to the destination—and, according to the SEP, we’re not so far\naway from the destination, in most people’s accounting—it’s, it’s reasonable—it’s common\nsense to go a little slower, just as it was reasonable to go from 75 basis points to 50 to 25 at every\nmeeting. And so the Committee thought overall that it was appropriate to moderate the pace, if\nonly slightly.\nThen there are benefits to that. So that gives us more information to make decisions. We\nmay try to make better decisions. I think it allows the economy a little more time to adapt as\nwe—as we make our decisions going forward, and we’ll get to see, you know—we haven’t\nreally—we don’t know the full extent of, of the consequences of the banking turmoil that we’ve\nseen. We, we—it would be early to see those, but we don’t know what the extent is. We’ll have\nsome more time to see that unfold. I mean, it’s, it’s just the idea that we’re trying to get this\nright. And this is—if you think of the two things as separate variables, then I think—I think that\nthe skip—I shouldn’t call it a skip—the, the decision makes sense.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. I know you said July is live. With only one June employment—with\nonly the June employment and the CPI report for June due to be released before the July\nmeeting—you get the ECI after, you get the Senior Loan Officer Survey after, you get some\nPage 9 of 26\nJune 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nbank earnings at the end of next month—what incremental information will the Committee be\nusing to inform their judgment on whether this is, in fact, a skip or a, a longer pause?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, I think you’re adding that to the, the data that we’ve seen since\nthe last meeting, too. You know, we—since we chose to maintain rates at this meeting, it’ll\nreally be a three-month period of data that we can look at. And I think that’s a full quarter, and I\nthink you can—you can draw more conclusions from that than you can from any six—any six-\nweek period.\nWe’ll look at those things. We’ll also look at the evolving risk picture. We’ll look at\nwhat’s happening in the financial sector. We’ll look at all the data, the evolving outlook, and\nwe’ll make a decision.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jeanna.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Thanks for taking our questions. Jeanna Smialek, New York\nTimes. You obviously, in your forecasts, marked up the sort of path for growth, marked down\nthe path for unemployment, and marked up the path for inflation pretty notably. I wonder, you\nknow, since March, what has changed to make you think that the economy’s a lot more resilient\nand inflation is going to be a lot more stubborn? And given that, you know, why do you feel\nconfident that this is as high as you’re going to have to revise the federal funds rate? Or do you\nthink it’s possible we could have even a higher than 5.6 percent terminal by the end of this, this\ncycle?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, I—I mean, on the first part, I just think we’re following\nthe data and also the outlook. The economy is—the labor market, I think, has surprised many, if\nnot all, analysts over the last couple of years with its extraordinary resilience, really. And it’s,\nit’s just remarkable. And that’s really, if you think about it—that’s what’s driving it. It’s job\nPage 10 of 26\nJune 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ncreation. It’s, it’s wages moving up. It’s, it’s supporting spending, which in turn is supporting\nhiring. And it’s, it’s really the engine, it seems, that is—that is driving the economy. And so\nit’s, it’s really the, the data. In terms of, you know—we, we always write down at these\nmeetings what we think the appropriate terminal rate will be at the end of this year. That’s,\nthat’s how we do it. It’s based on our, our own individual assessments of what the most likely\npath of the economy is. It can be—it can actually, in reality, wind up being lower or higher.\nAnd, you know, there’s really no way to know. But it’s—it is—it’s, it’s what people think as of\ntoday, and as the—as the data come in, it, it can move around during the intermeeting period. It\ncould wind up back in the same place. But it really will be data driven. I can’t—I can’t tell you\nthat that I ever have a lot of confidence that we can see where the—where the federal funds rate\nwill be that far in advance.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Mr. Chairman, thanks for taking my question. You had said back at\nthe end of May that you thought risks were getting closer to being into balance. Is that still the\ncase, or has your mind changed about the balance of risks out there? And also, could you give us\nan idea of what would be a sufficiently restrictive funds rate? Is the—obviously, the current rate,\naccording to the Committee, is not sufficiently restrictive. Is it 5.6? Is it 6? Where is\nsufficiently restrictive? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, I, I would say again that I think that, over time, the\nbalance of risks, as we move from very, you know—from interest rates that are effectively zero\nnow to 5 percentage points with, with an SEP calling for additional hikes—I think we’ve moved\nmuch closer to our destination, which is that sufficiently restrictive rate, and I think that means\nby—almost by definition that the—that the risks of, of sort of overdoing it and under,\nPage 11 of 26\nJune 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nunderdoing it are, are getting closer to being in balance. I still think, and my, my colleagues\nagree, that, that the risks to inflation are to the upside still. So we don’t—we don’t think we’re\nthere with inflation yet because we’re just looking at the data. And if you look at the—at the full\nrange of, of inflation data, particularly the core data, you just—you just aren’t seeing a lot of\nprogress over the last year. Headline, of course, inflation has come down materially, but, as you\nknow, we look at core [inflation] as a better indicator of where inflation overall is going.\nSufficiently—so I think, you know, what, what we’d like to see is credible evidence that\ninflation is topping out and then beginning to come down. That’s, that’s what we want to see—\nof course that’s what we want to see. And I, I think it’s—it’s also—we understand that there are\nlags, but remember that it’s, it’s more than a year since financial conditions began tightening. I\nthink it’s—I think the reason we’re, we’re comfortable pausing is that we are still—much of the\ntightening took place over last summer and later into the year. And I think it’s, it’s reasonable to\nthink that some of that may come into effect. So we’re, you know—I think stretching out into a\nmore moderate pace is appropriate to, to allow you to make that judgment of sufficiency, you\nknow, more—with more data over time.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Rachel.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Hi, Chair Powell. Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. Thanks\nfor taking our questions. I wanted to ask further on the lag effects—when you’re considering\nwhen you would hike again throughout the course of the year, are there things that you would\nexpect to kick in as those lag effects come, come into effect that would inform your decisions?\nHave you learned things over the past year that give you some sense of timeline for when to\nexpect those lags to come into effect?\nPage 12 of 26\nJune 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah. So it’s a—it’s a challenging thing in, in economics. It’s, it’s\nsort of standard thinking that monetary policy affects economic activity with long and variable\nlags. Of course, these days, financial conditions begin to tighten well in advance of actual rate\nhikes. So if you—if you look back when we were lifting off, we started talking about lifting\noff—by the time we had lifted off, the two-year [interest rate], which is a pretty good estimate of\nwhere [monetary] policy is going, had gone from 20 basis points to 200 basis points.\nSo in that sense, tightening happens much sooner than it used to in a world where—\nwhere news was in newspapers and not, you know, not on, on the wire. So that’s, that’s\ndifferent. But it’s still the case that what you see is interest-sensitive spending is affected very,\nvery quickly—so housing, and durable goods, and things like that. But broader demand, and\nspending, and, and asset values, and things like that—they just take longer.\nAnd you can pretty much find research to support whatever answer you would like on\nthat. So there’s not any certainty or agreement in the profession on how long it takes. So, you\nknow, then that makes it challenging, of course. So we’re, we’re looking at the calendar. We’re,\nwe’re looking at what’s happening in the economy. We’re having to make these judgments.\nAgain, it’s one of the main reasons why it makes sense to go at a slightly more moderate\npace now as we seek that, that ultimate—I can’t point to—that ultimate endpoint. I can’t point to\na specific data point. I think we’ll see it when we see inflation, you know, really, really\nflattening out reliably and then starting to soften. I think we’ll know that we’re—that it’s\nworking. And, ideally, by, by taking a little more time, we won’t go well past the level where we\nneed to go.\nPage 13 of 26\nJune 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nRACHEL SIEGEL. I was curious if you could give us an update on what you’re seeing\non credit tightening since the bank incidents for March and how you’re teasing that out apart\nfrom these lag effects.\nCHAIR POWELL. So it’s, it’s too early still to, to try to assess the full extent of what\nthat might mean. And, you know, that’s something we’re going to be watching, of course. And,\nyou know, if we were to see what, what we would view as significant tightening beyond what\nwould normally be expected because of, of this channel, then, you know, we would factor that\ninto account on, on—in, in making rate decisions. So that’s, that’s how we think about it.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Chris.\nCHRIS RUGABER. Thanks. Chris Rugaber at Associated Press. You mentioned that\nmany of the trends are in place that you want to see—core services ex. housing has come in\npretty low in the past couple of months. And, as you noted, a significant portion of core inflation\nis now housing prices. And then we’ve had some quirks in used-car prices.\nSo given that these trends are in place, I guess I’m sort of asking the flip side of Nick’s\nquestion: Why signal additional rate hikes? Aren’t things headed in the direction you need?\nWhy not simply give it even more time? Or—it’s surprising to see so much hawkishness in the\ndots, given what we’re seeing recently.\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah. So, you know, we’ve—remember, we’ve—we’re two and a\nhalf years into this—or two and a quarter years into this. And forecasters, including Fed\nforecasters, have consistently thought that inflation was about to turn down and, you know,\ntraditional—you know, typically forecasted that it would and been wrong.\nSo I think if you—I think if you look at the—at core PCE inflation overall—look at it\nover the last six months—you’re just not seeing a lot of progress. It’s running, and it’s running\nPage 14 of 26\nJune 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nat a level, you know, over 4½ percent—far above our, our target and not really, you know,\nmoving down. We want to see it moving down decisively. That’s all. We’re, you know, of\ncourse, we’re going to get inflation down to 2 percent over time. We, we don’t want to do—we,\nwe want to do that with the minimum damage we can to the economy, of course.\nBut we have to get inflation down to 2 percent, and we will. And we just don’t see that\nyet. So, hence, you see today’s policy decision: both, both to write down further rate hikes by\nthe end of this year but also to, you know, to take—to, to moderate somewhat the pace with\nwhich we’re moving.\nCHRIS RUGABER. Quick follow-up. I mean, the last press conference you mentioned\nyou didn’t see wages driving inflation. And, you know, there was some research from the San\nFrancisco Fed suggesting wages aren’t necessarily a key driver. But you’ve talked about the\nlabor market today and the need for softening. Can you give us a little more, specifically, of how\nyou see the tight labor market driving inflation at this point? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Right. So I’m, I’m not going to comment on any particular paper,\nbut I, I would say that the—I think the overall picture is that at the beginning in, you know, early\n2021, inflation was really becoming from very strong demand for—largely for goods. People\nwere still at home. They had money in the bank, and they wanted to spend—they spent a lot on\ngoods.\nAnd, of course, at the same time—and because of that high demand, to some extent,\nsupply chains got all snarled up. So prices went way up. Inflation went way up. So that was\nthe, the origin, and it wasn’t really particularly about the labor market or wages. But as you—as\nyou moved into—through ’21, into ’22, and now in ’23, I think many, many analysts believe that\nit will be important—an important part of getting inflation down, especially in the nonhousing\nPage 15 of 26\nJune 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nservices sector, to getting wage inflation back to a level that is sustainable, that is consistent with\n2 percent inflation.\nWe actually have seen wages broadly move down but just at a quite gradual pace. So—\nand that’s, you know, that’s a little bit of the finding of the Bernanke paper with Blanchard of a\nfew weeks ago, which is very consistent with, with what I, I would think.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Michael McKee.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television. You said\nin the past that you don’t like to surprise markets. It’s kind of been the Fed’s view markets\nshould have an idea of what you’re going to do before you go in. You also said a number of\ntimes that it would take a while to bring inflation down. You reiterated that again today and that\nwe, we’d get to a point where inflation could be sticky.\nSo I’m wondering, as we go into the next meetings, how Wall Street or others should\nlook at your reaction function. What will you be reacting to—time or data? In other words, if\nnothing much changes—if we’re looking at the same sort of labor market, the same sort of\ninflation levels in July or in September or November—will you move because you’ve said you\nfeel you need to? Is it time that’s going to require additional movement, or would it be reversal\nin inflation?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I, I don’t want to deal with, with hypotheticals about different\nways data might move. And so, we, you know—we of course—we’re not—we don’t go out of\nour way to surprise markets or the public. At the same time, our main focus has to be on getting\nthe policy right. And that’s, that’s what we’re doing here, and that’s what we’ll do for the\nupcoming meetings.\nPage 16 of 26\nJune 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nI will say the July meeting will be “live,” and we’ll just have to see. I think you’ll, you’ll\nsee the data, you’ll hear Fed people talking about it, and, and markets will have to make a—\nmake a judgment.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Well, do you think inflation is likely to continue coming down\nbased on the lags and based on your threat of additional movement? Or are we going to be in a\nperiod where we’re not going to know what’s happening?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, I, I think if you look at—if, if you just look at—I’ll just\npoint you to the forecast. So inflation is running—core PCE inflation is running at about 4½, a\nlittle higher than 4½ percent. And the, the median FOMC participant thinks it will go down to\n3.9 on a 12-month basis. This is by the end of this year.\nSo that’s expecting pretty substantial progress. That’s, that’s a pretty significant decline\nfor half a year. So that’s, that’s the forecast. You know, we’ll—we do try to be transparent in\nour reaction function. We’re, we’re committed to getting inflation down. And that’s the\nnumber-one thing. So that’s how I think about it.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Victoria Guida with Politico. Could you talk about the balance\nsheet and how you’re thinking about it? What, what are you looking for to judge whether we’re\napproaching reserve scarcity? And is Treasury issuance going to affect that? Also, are you\nconsidering lowering the RRP rate in order to take some pressure off banks?\nCHAIR POWELL. So let me say, first of all, on the Treasury part of it—if I can talk\nabout that and then go back to the balance sheet. So on that—of course, we’ve been very\nfocused on that for a couple of months, as everyone has. [The] Treasury has laid out its\nborrowing plans publicly. I think we all saw—I saw the Secretary’s comments yesterday to the\nPage 17 of 26\nJune 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\neffect that [the] Treasury has consulted widely with market participants about how to avoid\nmarket disruption and that they’re going to watch carefully for that.\nSo that’s, that’s from the Treasury, which actually sets the, you know, the, the\nborrowings. At the Fed, we’ll be monitoring market conditions carefully as the Treasury refills\nthe, the TGA. The adjustment process is very likely to involve both a reduction in the RRP\nfacility and also in reserves. It’s really hard to say at the—at the beginning of this which will\nbe—which will be greater.\nWe are starting at a very high level of reserves—and still elevated over RRP take-up, for\nthat matter—so we don’t think reserves are likely to become scarce in the near term or even over\nthe course of the year. So that’s, that’s—that’s the—that’s the Treasury part of the answer. We\nwill, of course, continue to monitor conditions in money markets, and we’re prepared to make\nadjustments to make sure that, that monetary policy transmission works.\nWas there another part of your question?\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Yeah—are you considering lowering the RRP rate to help take\nsome pressure off banks?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we, we have a number of—I would say the [ON] RRP [facility]\ndoesn’t look like it’s, it’s pulling money out of—out of the banking system. It’s actually been\nshrinking here lately. So I don’t think—that’s not something, something we’ve thought about a\nlot over time. It doesn’t really look like that’s, that’s something that we would do. I think it’s—I\nthink it’s a tool that we have.\nIf we want to use it, we can. There are other tools we can—we can use to address money\nmarket issues. But I wouldn’t say that that’s something that’s likely that we would do in the near\nterm.\nPage 18 of 26\nJune 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jonnelle.\nJONNELLE MARTE. Jonnelle Marte with Bloomberg. Have you seen sufficient\ncooling in the housing market to bring inflation down? For example, how does the recent\nrebound affect your forecasts, and how does it factor into monetary policy?\nCHAIR POWELL. So certainly housing—very interest sensitive, and it’s the first place,\nreally, or one of the first places, that’s either helped by low rates or, or that is held back by, by\nhigher rates. And we certainly saw that over the course of the last year. We now see housing\nputting in a bottom and maybe even moving up a little bit.\nYou know, we’re watching that situation carefully. I do think we—we will see rents,\nrents and, and house prices filtering into, into housing services inflation. And I, I don’t see them\ncoming up quickly. I, I do see them kind of—kind of wandering around at a relatively low level\nnow, and that’s appropriate.\nJONNELLE MARTE. Do you think you’ll have to target that with further rate increases?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, I think we, we look at everything. We don’t just look at\nhousing. So I think, you know, the way it works is the individual participants sit in their offices\nall over the country, and they write down their forecast and—including their most likely\nforecasts—including their rate forecast. And then they send it in on Friday afternoon, and we\ncumulate it, and then we publish it for you.\nSo that’s how—that’s how they do that. Well, I don’t know that housing is, is itself\ngoing to be driving the rates picture, but it’s part of it.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Edward.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you for taking the question, Mr. Chairman. Edward\nLawrence with Fox Business. So I want to go back to comments you made about, in the past,\nPage 19 of 26\nJune 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nabout unsustainable fiscal path. The CBO projects the federal deficit to be $2.8 trillion in\n10 years. The CBO also says that federal debt will be $52 trillion by 2033. At what point do\nyou talk more firmly with lawmakers about fiscal responsibility? Because—assuming monetary\npolicy cannot handle alone the inflation or keep that inflation in check with the higher-level\nspending.\nCHAIR POWELL. I don’t do that. That’s really not my job. We—we hope and expect\nthat other policymakers will respect our independence on, on monetary policy. And we don’t see\nourselves as, as, you know, the judges of appropriate fiscal policy. I will say, and many of my\npredecessors have said, that we’re on an unsustainable fiscal path and, and that needs to be\naddressed over time. But I think trying to get into, into that with lawmakers would be—would\nbe kind of inappropriate, given our independence and our need to stick to our knitting.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Is there any conversation then about the Federal Reserve\nfinancing some of that debt that we’re seeing coming down the pike?\nCHAIR POWELL. No. Under no circumstances.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Courtenay.\nCOURTENAY BROWN. Thanks for taking our questions, Chair Powell. So looking at\nthe SEP, it looks like GDP for this year was raised significantly—your forecast for GDP this\nyear. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, was pulled downward. And so should we take that as\na sign that the Committee is more confident about the prospects of a soft landing—at least\nmore—at least as it relates to what you were expecting in, in March?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, I—I would just say it this way. I continue to think—and\nthis really hasn’t changed—that there is a path to getting inflation back down to 2 percent\nwithout having to see the kind of sharp downturn and, and large losses of employment that we’ve\nPage 20 of 26\nJune 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nseen in so many past instances. It’s, it’s possible. A—in a way, a strong labor market is—that,\nthat gradually cools could, could aid that along—it could aid that along. But I, I guess I want to\ncome back to the, the main thing, which is, though, simply this. We, we see—the Committee—\nas you can see from the SEP, the Committee is completely unified in the need to get inflation\ndown to 2 percent and will do whatever it takes to get it down to 2 percent over time. That is our\nplan. And, you know, we, we understand that allowing inflation to get entrenched into the—in\nthe U.S. economy is the thing that we cannot, cannot allow to happen for the benefit of today’s\nworkers and families and businesses but also for the future. Getting price stability back and, and\nrestored will benefit generations of people as long as it’s sustained. And it really is the bedrock\nof the economy. And, and you should understand that that is our top priority.\nCOURTENAY BROWN. Just a quick follow-up on that. I’m just a little confused\nbecause you said the Committee will do whatever it takes to get inflation down over time, but\nwhen I look at the SEP, inflation is still projected to be elevated next year, but the fed funds rate\nis lower than where it is now. Can you help me understand that?\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So, you know, if you look two and three years out with, with\nthe forecast—first of all, I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t put too much weight on forecasts even one year\nout because they’re, they’re so highly uncertain. But what they’re showing is that as inflation\ncomes down in the—in the forecast, if you don’t lower interest rates, then real rates are actually\ngoing up, right? So just to maintain a real rate, the nominal rate at that point—two years out,\nlet’s say—should come down just to maintain real rates. And if—and actually, you know, since\nwe’re, we’re probably going to—we’re, we’re having real rates that are going to have to be\nmeaningfully positive and significantly. So for us to get inflation down, that probably means—\nthat, that certainly means that, that it will be appropriate to cut rates at such time as inflation is\nPage 21 of 26\nJune 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ncoming down really significantly. And again, we’re talking about a couple of years out. I think,\nas, as anyone can see, not a single person on the Committee wrote down a rate cut this year, nor\ndo I think it is at all likely to be appropriate, if you think about it. Inflation has not really moved\ndown. It has—it has not so far reacted much to our—to our existing rate hikes. And so we’re\ngoing have to keep at it.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Julie.\nJULIE CHABANAS. I’m sorry. Thank you. Hi, Chair Powell. Julie Chabanas, AFP\nNews Agency. The May job report showed a rebound in May in the Black workers’\nunemployment. Is it consistent with the Fed’s maximum-employment mandate? Are you\nworried about that—about this rebound?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we are, of course, worried about—there are—there are long-\nstanding differences in racial and ethnic groups across, across our labor market. That’s a factor\nthat we don’t—we can’t really address with our tools. But we do consider that when we’re\nthinking about what constitutes maximum employment—it is, for us, a broad and inclusive goal.\nAnd so we do watch that. But remember, all unemployment, including Black unemployment,\nhas been bouncing around right near historic lows—historic modern lows here. So we’re still\ntalking about, I mean, what is as strong a labor market as we’ve seen in, you know, a half-\ncentury here in the United States. So overall unemployment of 3.7 percent is, is higher—three-\ntenths higher than it was measured to be at the last—a month ago. But, still, it’s extraordinarily\nlow. And so it’s a very, very tight labor market.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Megan.\nMEGAN CASSELLA. Thank you. I want to follow up first a little bit just on the rent\nquestion on housing. We heard Governor Waller talk about how—I’ll back up. We haven’t\nPage 22 of 26\nJune 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nquite seen the slowdown in rents show up in CPI yet. And we did hear Governor Waller talk\nabout how an uptick in housing might mean that there’s not going to be as much relief coming or\na shorter bit of relief than we thought. Can you talk about how you’re thinking about that and\nhow that played into today’s outcome?\nCHAIR POWELL. I wouldn’t say—that’s, you know—as a factual matter, that’s correct.\nWe do need to see, you know, rents bottom out here or at least stay quite low in terms of their\nincreases because we want—we want the, you know, we want inflation to come down. And\nrental is, is a very large part of the CPI—about a third—and it’s about half of that for the PCE.\nSo it’s important. And so we’re—it’s something that we’re watching very carefully. It’s part of\nthe overall picture. I wouldn’t say it’s the decisive part, but take a step back. What you see is—\nlook at—look at core inflation over the past six months, a year. You’re just not seeing a lot of\nprogress—not the kind of progress we want to see. And that, that’s—it’s hard to avoid that.\nAnd, you know, the Committee—people on the Committee—the median went up significantly,\nso that the median participant now thinks that core PCE inflation on a 12-month basis will be\n3.9 percent this year. So, once again, every year for the past three years, it’s gone up over the\ncourse of the year, and that’s doing that again. So we see that, and we see that inflation forecasts\nare coming in low again, and we see that—that that tells us that we need to do more. And so\nwe’re—that’s why you see the SEP with—where it is.\nMEGAN CASSELLA. Could you also talk briefly about your outlook for wages and,\ngiven the recent slowdown in core services excluding housing, how far you think wages might\nneed to fall in order to get inflation back in line?\nCHAIR POWELL. So wages will continue to increase. So we, we, you know—what\nwe’re talking about is having wage increases still at a very strong level but at a level that’s\nPage 23 of 26\nJune 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nconsistent with 2 percent inflation over time. And so I, I think we’ve seen some progress—all,\nall of the major measures of wages have, have moved down from extremely elevated—not\nextremely elevated—highly elevated levels a year or so ago, and they’re, they’re moving back\ndown but, but quite gradually. And, and, you know, we want to see that, that process continue\ngradually. Of course, it’s great to see wage increases, particularly for people at the lower end of\nthe income spectrum. But we want that as part of the process of getting inflation back down to\n2 percent, which benefits everyone. I mean, inflation hurts those same people more than anyone\nelse. People on a fixed income are hurt the worst, and the fastest, by high inflation.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Greg.\nGREG ROBB. Thank you so much, Chair Powell. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. I just\nwondered if the Committee has talked at all about the labor market and, and—there, there’s\nstrikes now in Hollywood and now the United Autoworkers are talking about a possible strike. I\nmean, aren’t workers—they have—we have some—workers have power now and are going to be\nseeking higher wages. Does that come up in your discussions? Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. So the topic of wages in the labor market and dynamics in the labor\nmarket could—is about as central a topic to our discussions as, as anything. I mean, it’s, it’s\nvery—labor economics, you know, and the labor market are utterly central. You know, it’s half\nof our mandate. So we spend a lot of time talking about that. I think, you know, we—there,\nthere are structural issues that are really not for the Fed. And so we don’t spend a lot of time—\nalthough we take notice of, of what’s going on, but we’re not, you know—we’re not involved in\ndiscussions or debates over, over strikes and things like that. But we—you know, we, we look,\nand we see what’s going on. And, you know, we’re making judgments about what it will take to\nget inflation down to 2 percent in the aggregate. And as I said, don’t think that was about—I\nPage 24 of 26\nJune 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ndidn’t—most folks would say now it wasn’t really about that—about wages at the beginning.\nAnd it’s becoming more about that as we—as we get into really service-sector inflation, which is\nthe part of the economy where we have seen the least progress.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Mark for the last question.\nMARK HAMRICK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mark Hamrick with Bankrate.\nWondering what your thoughts are now about systemic risk now that we’re about three months\npast the failure of Silicon Valley Bank. And also, specifically, what are the risks associated with\ncommercial real estate as well as nonbank financials? And could you further elevate those risks\nwith higher still rates, possibly for longer?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I’m trying to think where to start. I’ll start with commercial real\nestate. We—of course, we’re watching that situation very carefully. There’s a substantial\namount of commercial real estate in the banking system. A, a large part of it is in smaller banks.\nIt’s well distributed—to the extent it’s well distributedthen, then the system could, could take\nlosses. We do expect that there will be losses, but they’ll be—they’ll be banks that have\nconcentrations, and those banks will experience larger losses. So we’re well aware of that.\nWe’re monitoring it carefully. You know, it feels like—it feels like something that will be\naround for some time, as opposed to, you know, something that will suddenly hit and, and, you\nknow, work its way into systemic risk.\nIn terms of nonbank financials—financial sector—there’s been a ton of work. And, you\nknow, clearly in the—in the pandemic, it really was—it was the nonbank financial sector where,\nwhere issues really arose. And, you know, there’s a lot of work going on in—with the\nAdministration, in particular, leading that to try to address issues in the Treasury market and, and\nin all kinds of areas in the nonbank financial market. And—but, you know, our jurisdiction at\nPage 25 of 26\nJune 14, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthe Fed is over banks—actually bank holding companies and some banks. So that’s, that’s really\nour main focus.\nYou know, in terms of the events of March—as I mentioned earlier, we will be carefully\nmonitoring that situation. You know, our, our job generally involves worrying about a lot of\nthings that may go wrong, and that would include the banks. It might be hard for me to identify\nsomething that we don’t worry about rather than that we do worry about. So we’re watching\nthose things very carefully. And as we see things unfold—as we see what’s happening with\ncredit conditions and, and also all the individual banks that are out there, you know, we’ll be able\nto take, to the extent it’s appropriate, we can take, if they’re macroeconomic implications, we\ncan take that into account in our rate setting. And so I guess that’s what I would say.\nMARK HAMRICK. Can I just follow up on the last part of that? Do you—do you risk\nfurther exacerbating those issues if you get up to another 50 basis points?\nCHAIR POWELL. So that’s—and, and I was—I guess I meant to address that by saying\nas we—as we watch, we’ll see what’s happening. And if we—if we’re seeing the kind of\ntightening of conditions that, that you could be referring to, then we can factor that—because\nreally, we’re—we use our—our rate tool is, is, you know, is—it really has macroeconomic\npurposes. So we’ll, we’ll take that into account. Of course, we have responsibility for financial\nstability as well. And that also is a factor that we’re always going to be considering.\nThank you very much.\nPage 26 of 26"

    "press_conf": "July 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nTranscript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference\nJuly 26, 2023\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on\nour dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.\nWe understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to\nbringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal. Price stability is the responsibility of the\nFederal Reserve. Without price stability, the economy doesn’t work for anyone. In particular,\nwithout price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions\nthat benefit all.\nSince early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary\npolicy. Today we took another step by raising our policy interest rate ¼ percentage point, and\nwe are continuing to reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace. We’ve covered a lot of\nground, and the full effects of our tightening have yet to be felt. Looking ahead, we will\ncontinue to take a data-dependent approach in determining the extent of additional policy firming\nthat may be appropriate. I’ll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing\neconomic developments.\nRecent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace.\nGrowth in consumer spending appears to have slowed from earlier in the year. Although activity\nin the housing sector has picked up somewhat, it remains well below levels of a year ago, largely\nreflecting higher mortgage rates. And higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear\nto be weighing on business fixed investment.\nThe labor market remains very tight. Over the past three months, job gains averaged\n244,000 jobs per month, a pace below that seen earlier in the year but still a strong pace. The\nunemployment rate remains low at 3.6 percent. There are some continuing signs that supply and\nPage 1 of 28\nJuly 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ndemand in the labor market are coming into better balance. The labor force participation rate has\nmoved up since last year, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years. Nominal wage growth\nhas shown some signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year. While the\njobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still substantially exceeds the supply of\navailable workers.\nInflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. Over the 12 months\nending in May, total PCE prices rose 3.8 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy\ncategories, core PCE prices rose 4.6 percent. In June, the 12-month change in the consumer\nprice index, or CPI, came in at 3.0 percent, and the change in the core, core CPI, was 4.8 percent.\nInflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year. Nonetheless, the process\nof getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go. Despite elevated inflation,\nlonger-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range\nof surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial\nmarkets.\nThe Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware\nthat high inflation imposes significant—significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power,\nespecially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and\ntransportation. We’re highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our\nmandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.\nAt today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by\n¼ percentage point, bringing the target range to 5¼ to 5½ percent. We are also continuing the\nprocess of significantly reducing our securities holdings. With today’s action, we’ve raised our\nPage 2 of 28\nJuly 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\npolicy rate by 5¼ percentage points since early last year. We have been seeing the effects of our\npolicy tightening on demand in the most interest rate–sensitive sectors of the economy,\nparticularly housing and investment. It will take time, however, for the full effects of our\nongoing monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation. In addition, the economy is\nfacing headwinds from tighter credit conditions for households and businesses, which are likely\nto weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation.\nIn determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return\ninflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening\nof monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation,\nand economic and financial developments. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by\nmeeting, based on the totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for\neconomic activity and inflation, as well as the balance of risks.\nWe remain committed to bringing inflation back to our 2 percent goal and to keeping\nlonger-term inflation expectations well anchored. Reducing inflation is likely to require a period\nof below-trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions. Restoring price stability\nis essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the\nlonger run.\nTo conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and\nbusinesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the\nFed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.\nThank you, and I look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve.\nPage 3 of 28\nJuly 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Mr. Chairman, thank you. You have, I think a couple of times in\nyour opening remarks, talked about this language “in determining the extent of additional policy\nfirming that may be appropriate.” Should we take that to mean that additional hikes are likely on\nthe way? And should we also believe that all future meetings—say, September and November—\nare live, or are you in an every-other-meeting mode? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So we haven’t made a decision to go to every other meeting. It’s not\nsomething we’ve looked at. We’re going to be going meeting by meeting, and as we go into\neach meeting, we’re going to be asking ourselves the same questions. So we haven’t made any\ndecisions about, about any future meetings, including the pace at which we’d consider hiking.\nBut we’re going to be assessing the need for further tightening that may be appropriate—you\nread the language—“to return inflation to 2 percent over time.”\nI would say that the intermeeting data came in broadly in line with expectations:\nEconomic activity remained resilient, job creation remains strong while cooling a bit, and the\nJune CPI report actually came in a bit better than expectations for a change. And the June CPI\nreport, of course, was welcomed, but it’s only one report, one month’s data. We hope that\ninflation will follow a lower path, as was—that will be consistent with the CPI reading, but we\ndon’t know that, and we’re just going to need to see more data.\nSo, what are we going to be looking at? Really, it will be the broader, the whole broader\npicture, and starting with—we’re looking for moderate growth, right? We’re looking for supply\nand demand through the economy coming into better balance, including, in particular, in the\nlabor market. We’ll be looking at inflation. We’ll be asking ourselves, does this whole\ncollection of data, do we assess it as suggesting that we need to raise rates further? And if we\nmake that conclusion, then we will go ahead and raise rates. So that’s how we’re thinking about\nPage 4 of 28\nJuly 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthe next meeting and, you know, how we’re thinking about meetings going forward potentially,\nbut, you know, we’re now mainly thinking about the next meeting.\nI will also say, since we’re talking about it, between now and the September meeting, we\nget two more job reports, two more CPI reports. I think we have an ECI report coming later this\nweek—which is [an] employment compensation index—and lots of data on economic activity.\nAll of that information is going to inform our decision as we go into that meeting. I would say it\nis certainly possible that we would raise funds again at the September meeting if the data warrant\nit, and I would also say it’s possible that we would choose to hold steady at that meeting. We’re\ngoing to be making careful assessments, as I said, meeting by meeting, and I’ll close by saying\nwe’ve raised the federal funds rate now by 525 basis points since March 2022. Monetary policy,\nwe believe, is restrictive and is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. If I could just briefly follow up on something you said there: You\nsaid the data in the intermeeting period, it probably came in in line with expectations. Does that\nmean there’s unlikely to have been a change in the overwhelming outlook of the Committee that\ntwo more hikes are necessary?\nCHAIR POWELL. I’m just going to go back to what I said. We, we—you know, that’s\nthe question. We have eight weeks now until the September meeting, and all that data that I\nrecited, we’re going to be looking at all that and making that assessment then. And it really—we\ndid have the one good reading, and, of course, we welcome that. But it’s just one reading, as\neverybody knows. And, and, you know, we’ve seen—we’ve seen this before in the data. Many\nforecasts call for, for rates—for, for inflation to remain low, but we just don’t know that until we\nsee the data. So we’ll be focusing on that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jeanna.\nPage 5 of 28\nJuly 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Thank you. Thanks for taking our questions, Chair Powell.\nObviously, you updated the language around growth in the statement today. You know, we’ve\nseen the Barbie movie numbers. We’ve seen everyone going to Taylor Swift concerts this\nsummer. It seems like the American consumers are in pretty good shape, and it does seem like\ngrowth is sort of picking back up a little bit or at least doing well. And I wonder, from your\nperspective, if that continues, if we see growth not just stabilizing but doing, you know,\nperforming well this summer, is that a problem because it’s inflationary, or is it good news\nbecause it suggests that a soft landing is more likely? Just how are you thinking about that sort\nof trajectory?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah. So I would say it this way: The overall resilience of the\neconomy, the fact that, that we’ve been able to achieve disinflation so far without any\nmeaningful negative impact on the labor market, the strength of the economy—overall, that’s a\ngood thing. It’s good to see that, of course. It’s also—you see consumer, consumer confidence\ncoming up and things like that. That will support activity going forward. But you’re, you’re\nright, though. At the margin, stronger growth could lead, over time, to higher inflation, and that\nwould require an appropriate response for monetary policy. So we’ll be watching that carefully\nand seeing how it evolves over time.\nMICHELE SMITH. Neil.\nNEIL IRWIN. Thanks, Chair Powell. Neil Irwin from Axios. So, as you referenced\nearlier, in the intermeeting period, soft CPI, jobs reports still strong but moderating, JOLTS look\ngood. So if you’re data dependent, why not pause again? Why not stay on hold? Why not take\nanother meeting off when the data was at least cutting in the direction you want to see?\nPage 6 of 28\nJuly 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. So if you go back to what we’re trying to do here, we’re trying to\nachieve a stance of policy that’s sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2 percent. At\nthe last meeting, we wrote down our individual estimates of that would take—of what that would\ntake, and the median of that was, was an additional two rate hikes. So I would say, we looked at\nthe interim intermeeting data and, as I mentioned, broadly consistent, not perfectly consistent,\nbut broadly consistent with expectations. And, as a result, we went ahead and, and took another\nstep. And that’s, you know, a labor market that continues to be strong but, but gradually\nslowing. I mentioned that the inflation report was actually a little better than expected, but, you\nknow, we’re, we’re going to be careful about taking too much signal from, from a single reading.\nAnd, you know, growth came in stronger than expected. So that’s how we look at it, and, and so\nwe did take that step today.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nick.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, markets\nwidely believe the median FOMC participant’s inflation forecast from June for the fourth quarter\nof this year will be too high, given autos and shelter, and that by September, that may warrant a\ndownward revision in the inflation forecast of 20 to 30 basis points. Would that type of inflation\nprogress be enough to hold rates steady from here, or do you need to see below-trend growth and\ndecelerating labor income growth to be convinced that you’ve done enough?\nCHAIR POWELL. So it’s hard to pick the pieces apart and say, you know, how much of\nthis and how much of that. You know, we’ll be looking at everything. And, you know, we’ll, of\ncourse, we’ll be looking to see whether the signal from June’s CPI is replicated or, or the\nopposite of replicated or whether it’s somewhere in the middle. We’ll be looking at the growth\ndata. We’ll be looking at the labor market data very closely, of course, and making an overall\nPage 7 of 28\nJuly 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\njudgment about that. It’s the totality of the data, I think, but with a particular focus on, on\nmaking progress on inflation.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. If I could follow up: Last month you said there were benefits to\nmoderating the pace of increases because it would give you more information to make decisions.\nWould another CPI report like the one we just had in June allow you to at least maintain that\nslower pace and defer until the fall any decision on whether you need that second rate hike?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I’m just going to tell you again what we’re going to do. In\nSeptember, we’re going to look at, at two additional job reports, two additional CPI reports, lots\nof activity data, and that’s what we’re going to look at, and we’re going to make that decision\nthen. And that decision could, could mean another hike in, in September, or it could mean that\nwe decide to maintain at that level. And, again, the question we’re going to be asking ourselves\nis, is the overall signal one that we need to do more, that we need to tighten further? And if we\nget that signal, whenever we get it, then—and that’s the collective judgment of the Committee—\nthen we will move ahead. If we don’t, you know, then, then we’ll have the option of maintaining\npolicy at that level, but it’s, it’s, you know, it’s really dependent so much on the data, and we just\ndon’t have it yet.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Chris.\nCHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Hi. Chris Rugaber at Associated Press. So consumer\nconfidence in the economy is rising, likely in large part because of, of the declines in headline\ninflation. You also see wages are also rising faster than prices now after trailing them for a long\ntime. How much are Americans truly harmed by inflation at its current level, headline level of\n3 percent? And with that in mind, when do you put some weight back on the employment side\nof the dual mandate?\nPage 8 of 28\nJuly 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. So I guess I’d say it this way: First, it is—it is a good thing that\nheadline inflation has come down so much, because that’s really what the public experiences.\nAnd, and I would say that having headline inflation move down that much almost creates a—it\nwill strengthen the broad sense that, that the public has that inflation is coming down, which will\nin turn, we hope, help inflation continue to move down. So you are really—sorry, your question\nwas?\nCHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Well, I mean, you’ve talked for many press conferences\nnow about the harm created by inflation, how hard it is for people. So how much of that are we\nstill seeing with inflation now down at 3 [percent]?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I guess I would put it this way. We, we—I’d say it this way: It’s\nreally a question of, how do you balance the two risks, the risk of doing too much or doing too\nlittle? And, you know, I would say that, you know, we’re coming to a place where, where there\nreally are risks on both sides. It’s hard to say exactly whether, whether they’re in balance or not,\nbut as our—as our stance has become more restrictive and inflation moderates, we do\nincreasingly face that risk. But, you know, we, we need to see that inflation is durably down\nthat far, you know.\nAs you know, we think, and most economists think, that core inflation is actually a better\nsignal of, of where headline inflation is going, because headline inflation is affected greatly by\nvolatile energy and food prices. So we would want core inflation to be coming down, because\nthat’s what we think—that’s—core is signaling where headline is going to go in the future. And\ncore inflation is still pretty elevated, you know? There’s reason to think it can come down now,\nbut it’s, it’s still quite elevated, and so we think we need to stay on task, and we think we’re\nPage 9 of 28\nJuly 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ngoing to need to hold, certainly, hold policy at a restrictive level for some time. And we need to\nbe prepared to raise further if that—if we think that’s appropriate.\nCHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Well, and then if inflation were to—just a quick\nfollow[up]: If it stays at 3 or drops even a little bit more, I mean, how much of an increase in\nunemployment do you think is acceptable to get that last bit of inflation? People are talking\nabout the potential difficulty of the last, so-called last mile of inflation. So—but how much?\nAgain, how much unemployment do you think is justified to get down that last one—\nCHAIR POWELL. So it is—it is a very positive thing that, actually, the unemployment\nrate is the same as it was when we lifted off in March of ’22, at 3.6 percent. So that’s a real\nblessing in that we’ve been able to achieve some disinflation, and we don’t seek to it. It’s not\nthat we’re aiming to, to raise unemployment, but I would just say, the historical record—we have\nto be honest about the historical record, which does suggest that when central banks go in and\nslow the economy to bring down inflation, the result tends to be some softening in labor market\nconditions. And so that is still the, the likely outcome here. And, you know, we hope that that’s\nas little as possible, but we have to be honest that that is—that is the likely outcome.\nThe worst outcome for everyone, of course, would be not to deal with inflation now, not\nget it done. Whatever the short-term social costs of getting inflation under control, the longer-\nterm social costs of failing to do so are greater, and the historical record is very, very clear on\nthat. If you go through a period where inflation expectations are not anchored, inflation is\nvolatile, it interferes with people’s lives and with economic activity, and, you know, that’s the—\nthat’s the thing we, we really need to avoid and will avoid.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Michael McKee.\nPage 10 of 28\nJuly 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMICHAEL MCKEE. At this point, you say the policy is restrictive, but all year long we\nhave seen growth surprise to the upside, unemployment to the downside, and inflation, lately, to\nthe downside. So I’m wondering, by definition, should you be restrictive enough right now\nunder these conditions? Do you think you might need to do more, because I’m curious about\nwhat you see as inflation dynamics now? Is the economy still moving in a direction where it\ncreates more inflation? People talk about base effects and higher energy costs, and now we have\nsome large labor settlements. Or is the economy disinflating, and you’re just, you’re able to go\nback to the old Fed policy of opportunistic disinflation?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I’ll just say again, the broader picture of what we want to see is,\nwe want to see easing of supply constraints and normalization of pandemic-related distortions to\ndemand and supply. We want to see economic growth running at moderate or modest levels to\nhelp ease inflationary pressures. We want to see continued restoration of supply and demand\nbalance, particularly in the labor market. And all of that should lead to declining inflationary\npressures.\nNow what we see is, we see those pieces of the puzzle coming together. And we’re\nseeing evidence of those things now, but I would—I would say that what, what our eyes are\ntelling us is that policy has not been restrictive long, restrictive enough for long enough to have\nits full desired effects. So we intend, again, to keep policy restrictive until we’re confident that\ninflation is coming down sustainably to our 2 percent target, and we’re prepared to further\ntighten if that is appropriate. And we think the process, you know, still probably has a, a long\nway to go.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Well, do you think under current conditions you are restrictive\nenough unless something changes?\nPage 11 of 28\nJuly 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, I think—we think, you know, today’s rate hike was\nappropriate, and I think we’re going to be looking at the incoming data to inform our decision at\nthe next meeting about, is the incoming data telling us that we need to do more? And if it does\ntell us that—collectively, if that’s our view—then we will do more.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Colby.\nCOLBY SMITH. Thank you. Colby Smith with the Financial Times. If September is,\nin fact, a live meeting, how does that square with the need for a more gradual tightening pace\nthat you spoke of last month in explaining the rationale for holding the funds rate steady at the\nJune meeting?\nCHAIR POWELL. So a more gradual pace doesn’t go immediately to [moving] every\nother meeting. It could be two out of three meetings, right? It could be—it just means if you’re\nslowing down, the point really was to slow down the decision cycle as, as we get closer and\ncloser to, we think, our destination. And I wouldn’t want to go automatically to [moving] every\nother meeting, because I just don’t think that’s—we don’t—I think it’s not an environment\nwhere we want to provide a lot of forward guidance. There’s a lot of uncertainty out there.\nWe just want to keep moving at what we think is the right pace, and I do think it makes\nall the sense in the world to slow down as we now make these finely judged decisions, and so\nthat’s what we did. And so I, I think it’s possible. I mentioned it before. It’s possible that we\nwould move at consecutive meetings—we’re not taking that off the table—or we might not. It’s\nreally going to depend on what the data tell us. That’s the best we can do.\nCOLBY SMITH. So we shouldn’t assume that every other meeting is the lowest\ntightening frequency, let’s say? It could be, you know, longer intervals in between as well?\nPage 12 of 28\nJuly 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. I think we’re—look, I think we’re going to—we’re going to make a\ndecision about the next meeting, and then we’re going to make a decision about the one after\nthat. And I think it’ll sort itself out.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Howard.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thanks. Howard Schneider with Reuters. So, among your\ncolleagues, there have been people who’ve said they feel that very little transmission has taken\nplace so far from monetary policy into the economy, and there are those who feel, they say, it’s\nhappened very fast this time, and it’s kind of up to date. Where are you on that continuum?\nCHAIR POWELL. So there’s a long-running debate about the lags between changes in\nfinancial conditions and the response to those changes from economic activity and inflation,\nright? So we know that in the modern era, financial conditions move in anticipation of our\ndecisions, and that has clearly been the case in this cycle. So, in a sense, the clock starts earlier\nthan it—than it used to.\nBut that doesn’t necessarily change the process from that point on, and it’s not clear that\nit has. We also—this is—I’ll tell you what we know and then what we don’t know. We know\nthat financial conditions affect economic activity and inflation with a lag that can be long and\nvariable, or lags, plural, that can be long and variable—a lot of uncertainty around the length of\nthe lags. And, by the way, that’s just one component of the broader uncertainty that we face.\nSo I’ll tell you how I—how I think about this. First, the first thing to say is, we’re\ndetermined to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time, and we will use our tools to do that.\nNo one should doubt that. I would look at it this way, though. The real federal funds rate is now\nin meaningfully positive territory. If you take the nominal federal funds rate, subtract the\nmainstream estimate of near-term inflation expectations, you get a real federal funds rate that is\nPage 13 of 28\nJuly 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nwell above most estimates of the longer-term neutral rate. So I would say, monetary policy is\nrestrictive, more so after today’s decision, meaning that it is putting downward pressure on\neconomic activity and inflation. We’ll keep monetary policy restrictive until we think it’s not\nappropriate to do so. So that’s how I think about it.\nI mean, if I sum it up, I would say: We’ve come a long way. We are resolutely\ncommitted to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal over time. Inflation has proved,\nrepeatedly, has proved stronger than we and other forecasts—forecasters have expected, and at\nsome point, that may change. We have to be ready to follow the data, and given how far we’ve\ncome, we can afford to be a little patient, as well as resolute, as we let this unfold.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. On the—on the credit side, I’m wondering if you saw\nanything in the—in the latest SLOOS data that made you think you’re getting a quantum of\ncredit contraction beyond what you’d expect. The bank lending data really is—the growth rate’s\nedging down towards below, heading below zero, which is usually, you know, a recession\nindicator.\nCHAIR POWELL. So I guess that the SLOOS will come out early next week, and I\nwould just say it’s broadly condition—consistent with what you would expect. You’ve got\nlending conditions tight and getting a little tighter. You’ve got weak demand, and, you know, it,\nit gives a picture of pretty tight credit conditions in the economy. I think it’s really hard to tease\nout whether—how much of that is from this source or that source, but I think what matters is, the\noverall picture is of tight and tightening lending conditions. And that’s, that’s what the SLOOS\nwill say.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Rachel.\nPage 14 of 28\nJuly 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Hi, Chair Powell. Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. Thanks\nfor taking our questions. Could you break down the reasons why inflation has fallen and what\nshare of that credit you would give to factors that don’t stem directly from rate hikes or that\nmight be within your control at all, like easing supply chains and a drop in energy prices over the\npast year?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah. So, interesting question. So let me start by saying that the\ninflation surge that we saw in the pandemic resulted from a collision of elevated demand and,\nand constrained supply, both of which followed from the unprecedented features of the pandemic\nand the response from fiscal and monetary policy. And we’ve always expected that the\ndisinflationary process would stem from, both from the normalization of those broad pandemic-\nrelated supply and demand conditions and from restrictive, restrictive monetary policy, which\nwould help return the balance between supply and demand by restraining demand. And we think\nthat’s broadly what we’re—what we’re seeing.\nSo to go, break it down a little further: Of course, headline inflation has come down\nsharply from elevated levels as energy and food prices have come down, mostly due to [a]\nreversal of the effects [on those prices that resulted] from the war in Ukraine. And that’s, that’s a\ngood thing, and the public experiences that, as I mentioned earlier.\nFor core inflation, I’d say there also—there has been a role for, for most—for, for both\nfactors, both that I mentioned. Clearly, for goods, normalization of supply conditions is playing\nan important role, as is the reversal, the beginning of the reversal, of spending—back into\nservices and away from goods.\nAnd take autos as an example. The combination of an increase in sales and inventories,\nwhile, while vehicle inflation has decelerated, points to a substantial role for supply, but there’s\nPage 15 of 28\nJuly 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nalso a role for demand, as, you know, the loans and things like that are more expensive. So\nthey’re both working there. Housing services inflation now starts to move down. Clearly, higher\nrates have, have slowed the housing market. You know, I would say, monetary policy is\nworking about as we expect, and we think—we think it’ll play an important role going forward,\nin particular in nonhousing services, where, really, we think that’s, that’s where the labor market\nwill come in as a very, very important factor. So we think both of those—both of those sources\nof disinflation are playing an important role.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. I see. And just to follow up, do you think that of those two sources,\nthat core will rely more heavily on seeing an impact from rate hikes, or is there a more even split\nthere, too?\nCHAIR POWELL. I think monetary policy is going to be important going forward\nbecause we, we’re sort of reaping now the benefits of the—of the reversal of some of the very\nspecific pandemic things. We’re seeing that with goods, in particular, with supply chains and\nshortages moving, and we’re seeing—so I think going forward, monetary policy will be\nimportant, particularly in that, in the sector, in the nonhousing services sector.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Edward.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you, Chair Powell. First, let me compliment your tie,\nthe choice of tie. It’s a good color. So thanks for taking our questions. So the Beige Book, it\nsaid, “Input cost pressures remained elevated for services firms but eased notably” for\nmanufacturing sectors. Is that an indication that there’s a, a wage inflation pressure? And how\ndo you target pressure on the wage inflation without pushing the economy into a recession?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think that, as it relates to goods, it’s really an indication that\nsupply chains and, and shortages are easing. And so, what was the first part of it?\nPage 16 of 28\nJuly 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. So, wage inflation. Like, how do you—how do you target\nwage inflation without pushing an economy into a recession?\nCHAIR POWELL. I don’t—I don’t think we’re targeting wage inflation. I think what\nwe’re—what we’re looking for is a broad cooling in labor market conditions. And that’s what\nwe’re seeing. So wages have actually been gradually moving down. They’re still at levels what\nwould—that would be consistent over a long period of time with 2 percent inflation.\nNonetheless, we’re making progress there. And by so many indicators, labor market demand is\ncooling. You can—you can look at surveys by workers and businesses who see that. You can\nlook at the quits rate normalizing. You can look at job openings coming down. You can look at\njust job creation in the, the establishment survey has, you know—it’s still at a high level, but it\nwas at, really, an extraordinarily high level for most of the last two years.\nSo you see cooling, particularly in private sector, in the last, you know, in the last report.\nSo I think we see that, and it’s happening at a gradual pace. So that’s actually not a bad thing, in\na sense, because if, if what we see is a labor market, very strong demand for labor, which is\nreally the engine of the economy—people are getting hired, many people going back to work,\ngetting wages, spending money—and that’s really what’s driving the economy but that it’s\ngradually slowing, it’s gradually cooling, that’s a good prescription for getting where we want\nto get.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. But still we see a push to raise minimum wage. We’re seeing\na lot of unions go on strike or threaten strike, and the common thing is, they come out with\nagreements like big pay increases, like UPS, and we have the autoworkers coming up. Are you\nconcerned then about a trend of series of big unions, these contracts, pushing wage inflation\nthen?\nPage 17 of 28\nJuly 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. Not for us to comment on, on contract negotiations. Not our job, not\nour role. You know, we, we monitor these things, and we’ll keep an eye on them, but, really,\nthat’s something that’s, that’s handled at that level and not—\nMICHELLE SMITH. Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi. Victoria Guida with Politico. I wanted to ask about the SEP,\nwhich suggests that you would cut rates as overall and core PCE get to around or under\n3 percent. And so I’m wondering, is the level of inflation what’s sort of important there as you\nthink about getting to 2 percent and when you might start cutting rates, or is the speed at which\ninflation is falling also important?\nCHAIR POWELL. I think you’d take both into account. I think you’d take everything\ninto account when you start cutting rates. It would—it would depend on the whole, on a wide\nrange of things. And when, when people are writing down rate cuts next year, you know, it just\nis a sense that inflation is coming down, and we’re comfortable that it’s coming down, and it’s\ntime to start cutting rates. I think—but I mean, there’s a lot of uncertainty between what\nhappens, you know, in the next meeting cycle, let alone the next year, let alone the year after\nthat. So it’s, it’s hard to say exactly what happens there, what’s motivating people.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. So if it’s sort of—sort of stubbornly in maybe the high 2s, you\nwouldn’t necessarily cut rates?\nCHAIR POWELL. I’m not going—I’m not saying that at all. I’m not giving you any\nnumerical guidance around that. I’m saying we would—we’d be comfortable cutting rates when\nwe’re comfortable cutting rates, and that won’t be this year, I don’t think. It would be—you\nknow, many people wrote down rate cuts for next year. I think the median was several for next\nyear. And that’s just going to be a judgment that we have to make then, a full year from now,\nPage 18 of 28\nJuly 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nand it’ll be about how confident we are that inflation is, in fact, coming down to our 2 percent\ngoal.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve.\nSTEVE MATTHEWS. A good part of Wall Street has become more confident that the\nFed is going to be able to engineer a soft landing, and they’ve reduced their forecast for a\nrecession. And I’m wondering if the staff has changed its view on the likelihood of a recession\nbeing likely and if you personally have changed your view in terms of becoming more confident\nthat you can achieve a soft landing.\nCHAIR POWELL. So it’s, it has been my view consistently that we do have a shot, and\nmy base case is that we will be able to achieve inflation moving back down to our target without\nthe kind of really significant downturn that results in high levels of job losses that we’ve seen in\nsome past—in some past instances, many past instances of tightening that look like ours. That’s\nbeen my view. That’s, that’s still my view. And I think, you know, that that’s sort of consistent\nwith, with what I see today. So—but it’s a long way from assured, and, and, you know, we have\na lot left to go to see that happen.\nSo the staff now has a noticeable slowdown in growth starting later this year in the\nforecast, but given the resilience of the economy recently, they are no longer forecasting a\nrecession. I just want to note that it’s—that our staff produces its own forecast, which is\nindependent of the forecasts that we as FOMC participants produce. Having an independent\nstaff forecast as well as the individual participant forecasts is really a strength of our—of our\nprocess. There’s just a lot of, I think, constructive diversity of opinion that, that helps us make—\ninforms our deliberations—helps us make, I hope, better decisions.\nPage 19 of 28\nJuly 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nSTEVE MATTHEWS. And is the reason for optimism that inflation has come down and\nyou still have a strong labor market? I mean, does that add to the optimism?\nCHAIR POWELL. I wouldn’t use the term “optimism” about this yet. I would—I would\nsay, though, that there’s a pathway, and, yes, that’s, that’s a good way to think about it. We’ve,\nwe’ve seen so far the beginnings of disinflation without any real costs in the labor market. And\nthat’s, that’s a really good thing. I would just also say the historical record suggests that there’s\nvery likely to be some softening in labor market conditions. And consistent with having a soft\nlanding, you would—you would have some softening in labor market conditions, and that’s still\nlikely as we—as we go forward with this process. But it’s a good thing to date that we haven’t—\nwe haven’t really seen that.\nWe’ve seen softening through other—not through unemployment, not through higher\nunemployment. We’ve seen softening through, you know, job openings coming down part of the\nway back to more normal levels; the quits rate, so people are not quitting as much; we’ve seen\nparticipation—people coming in, and so labor supply has, has improved, which has lowered the\ntemperature in the labor market, which was quite overheated, you know, going back a year or so.\nSo we’re seeing that kind of cooling, and that’s, that’s very healthy, and, you know, we hope it\ncontinues.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jeff.\nJEFF COX. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Jeff Cox from CNBC.com. You and other Fed\nofficials in the past have suggested that you don’t need to keep hiking until inflation hits\n2 percent, that—as long as you see continued progress. So I’m wondering, how close do you\nneed to get with the inflation numbers coming down? How many months of data do you need to\nPage 20 of 28\nJuly 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nsee that will—that will give you sufficient confidence, and how, how far does this fight need to\ngo before you’re willing to kind of declare victory on it?\nCHAIR POWELL. So the idea that we would keep hiking until inflation gets to\n2 percent—it would be a prescription [for a policy] of going way past the target. That’s, that’s\nclearly not the appropriate way to think about it. So, and in fact, if you look at our forecast, we,\nwe—the median participant—and, again, these are forecasting out years, so take them with a\ngrain of salt. But people are cutting rates next year because, because, you know, the federal\nfunds rate is at a restrictive level now.\nSo if we see inflation coming down credibly, sustainably, then we don’t need to be at a\nrestrictive level anymore. We can, you know, we can move back to a—to a neutral level and\nthen below a neutral level at a certain point. I think we would, you know, we would—we, of\ncourse, would be very careful about that. We’d really want to be sure that inflation is coming\ndown in a sustainable level. And it’s hard to make—I’m not going to try to make a numerical\nassessment of when and where that would be. But that’s the way I would think about it, is you’d\nstart—you’d stop raising long before you got to 2 percent inflation, and you’d start cutting before\nyou got to 2 percent inflation, too, because we don’t see ourselves getting to 2 percent inflation\nuntil—you know, all the way back to 2—until 2025 or so.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jennifer.\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. Thank you, Chair Powell. Jennifer Schonberger with\nYahoo Finance. It’s been over four months since a handful of regional banks, including Silicon\nValley Bank, failed. When you look at credit conditions now, given Banc of California’s\nacquisition of PacWest, does this acquisition suggest the full impact has not been felt, or are you\nPage 21 of 28\nJuly 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ncomfortable saying that we’ve seen most of the ripple effects that may have occurred at this\npoint? And how does this play into your outlook for policy?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I don’t want to comment on any particular merger proposal, but I\nwill say, things have settled down for sure out there. Deposit flows have stabilized. Capital and\nliquidity remain strong. Aggregate bank lending was stable quarter over quarter and is up\nsignificantly year over year. Banking-sector profits generally are coming in strong this quarter.\nAnd, overall, the banking system remains strong and resilient. Of course, we’re still watching,\nyou know, the situation carefully and monitoring, you know, monitoring conditions in, in the\nbanking sector.\nIn terms of the, the actual effect on—if you think of a particular set of banks that were,\nwere affected because of their size and business model and things like that, that were more\naffected by the turmoil in March than others, it’s very hard, as I mentioned; it’s very hard to sort\nof tease out the effects on this very large economy of ours from them tightening. They may be\ntightening a little bit more, probably are, than other banks.\nThe SLOOS has been telling us for more than a year that banking conditions are\ntightening. That process is ongoing, and that will restrain economic growth. So I think—I think\nwe have to take a step back from “I can’t separate those anymore.” I think—I think, basically,\nwe’re just looking at the overall picture, which is one of tightening credit conditions. And that’s,\nthat’s going to restrain economic activity. It is restraining economic activity. So that’s how I\nwould look at it.\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. And how is that informing your outlook for setting\npolicy?\nPage 22 of 28\nJuly 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think we—that goes—that’s—an expected result of tightening\ninterest rate policy is that—is that bank credit conditions—bank lending conditions would\ntighten as well. And so the question is, is it more effective this time because of what happened\nin May? I just don’t think we know that. I think we’re looking at the current data in GDP, and\nwe’re seeing strong spending. We’re seeing a strong economy, and it’s made us confident that\nwe can go ahead and raise interest rates now for the third time since the March events. And I—it\nseems like the economy is weathering this well, but, of course, we’re watching it carefully and,\nand expect to continue to do that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Megan.\nMEGAN CASSELLA. Hi, Chair Powell. Thanks for taking our questions. Megan\nCassella with Barron’s. I wondered on wages if you were at all concerned about any inflationary\nimpact of wages now outpacing inflation, which is likely contributing to the boost in consumer\nsentiment and the continued strength of the consumer that we’ve been seeing.\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, [growth in nominal] wages in excess of inflation means [that\nincreases in] real wages are positive. Again, that’s a great thing. Of course, we want that. We\nwant people to have [gains in] real wages. But we want wages to be going up at a level that’s\nconsistent with, with 2 percent inflation over time. As I mentioned, [increases in] nominal wages\nhave been coming down gradually, and that’s what we want to see. We expect to see more of\nthat. That’s just more of what’s consistent over a longer period of time. We don’t really think\nthat, that wages were an important cause of inflation in the first year or so of the outbreak. But I\nwould say that wages are probably an important issue going forward. Labor market conditions\nbroadly are going to be an important part of, of getting inflation back down, and that’s why we\nthink we need some further softening in labor market conditions.\nPage 23 of 28\nJuly 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMEGAN CASSELLA. This goes sort of to the balance of risks question, but you\nmentioned at the start how you’re keeping an eye on consumer activity and whether there might\nbe some sort of a rebound there, and I’m curious what the Fed’s explanation would be to families\nif further interest rate hikes start to hit the labor market—start to, you know, drive that sentiment\nback down. What’s the message there of, of why you continue to keep rates elevated or to raise\nthem?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, you know, we have a job assigned to us by Congress to get\ninflation under control. And we think the, the single most important thing we can do to benefit\nthose very families, especially families at the lower end of the income spectrum, is to get\ninflation sustainably under control and restore price stability. We think that is the most\nimportant thing we can do now, and we’re determined to do that.\nAnd I would just point out that the people who are the most hurt by inflation right away\nare people who are on a low fixed income, who, you know, when you’re talking about travel or,\nyou know, transportation costs, heating costs, clothing, food, things like that, those—if you’re\njust making it through each month on your paycheck and prices go up, you’re in trouble right\naway. Even middle-class people have some resources and can absorb inflation. People, people\non the lower end of the income spectrum have a harder time doing that. So we need—we need to\nget this done. And, you know, the record is clear that if we—if we take too long or if, if we\ndon’t succeed, that the pain will only be greater. So that’s, that’s how I would explain what\nwe’re doing.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Simon.\nSIMON RABINOVITCH. Thank you, Chair Powell. Simon Rabinovitch with the\nEconomist. You had said last month that this meeting this week was going to be a live one. In\nPage 24 of 28\nJuly 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthe event, the market had assigned a, you know, a roughly 99 percent probability to the rate\nmove that you announced today. The decision was, of course, unanimous, and the statement was\nbasically unchanged from last month. So may I ask, you know, to what extent was the meeting\nactually a live one? Was there ever any doubt over the past two days about what the decision\nwas, was actually going to be?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, I mean, you could—“Was there doubt?” Look, I would say\nthere’s a range of views on the Committee, and when you see the minutes in three weeks, you’ll\nsee that. There’s a range of views about what we should do at this meeting and what we should\ndo at the next meeting, and it’s a—it’s a process that we go through. Many times when we go\ninto a meeting, the decision is not, you know, fundamentally in doubt. Nonetheless, we have the\nmeeting, and some—some—some meetings are, you know, less uncertain than others, and I’ll\njust leave it at that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Evan.\nEVAN RYSER. Evan Ryser, Market News International. Thank you, Chair Powell.\nFinancial conditions have been loosening at a fairly steady clip in recent weeks—the dollar, the\nstock market, et cetera. What does that mean for the Fed and being sure that inflation will come\ndown to target?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we monitor, of course, financial conditions, broad financial\nconditions. You’re right. It’s the dollar and equities, but—and, you know, we’re, of course,\nvery focused on rates and our own policy. You know, we will—we’re going to use our policy\ntools to—working through financial conditions—to get inflation under control The implication\nis, you know, we will do what it takes to get inflation down, and in principle, that, that could\nmean that if financial conditions get looser, we have to do more. But what tends to happen,\nPage 25 of 28\nJuly 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthough, is, financial conditions get in and out of alignment with what we’re doing, and, and,\nultimately, over time, we get where we need to go.\nEVAN RYSER. If I could also ask about the SEP from June that showed rate cuts—do\nyou expect the Fed to cut nominal rates next year while also continuing QT?\nCHAIR POWELL. So that, that could happen. The question is, you know, is that\nconsistent with, with—so if you think about both of them as normalization, imagine it’s a world\nwhere things are okay, and it’s time to bring rates down from what are restrictive levels to more\nnormal levels. Normalization, in the case of, of the balance sheet, would be to reduce QT or to\ncontinue it, depending on where you are in the cycle. So they are two independent things. And,\nyou know, really, the active tool of monetary policy is rates. But you can imagine circumstances\nin which it would be appropriate to have them working in what might be seen to be just different\nways. But that wouldn’t be the case.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Kyle.\nKYLE CAMPBELL. Thanks, Chair Powell. Kyle Campbell with American Banker. I\nhave a question about the discount window. I’m wondering if, since the bank failures of the\nspring, if you’ve seen signs that banks have taken more steps to be proactive in assuring that\nthey’re ready to use that facility if they need to and if you have any sort of thoughts on whether\npolicies might be appropriate for making sure that banks sort of test regularly to, to show that\nthey are prepared to use it. Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. So that’s a very important thing. Yes. And yes to both sides of that.\nYou know, yes, banks are now working to see that they are ready to use the discount window,\nand we are strongly encouraging them to do that—banks broadly. We did find, as you know,\nduring the events of March and that, you know, that it’s a little clunkier. It can be a little\nPage 26 of 28\nJuly 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nclunkier and not as quick as it needs to be sometimes. So why not be in a situation where, where\nyou’re just much more ready in case you—in case you need to access the discount window?\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Mark Hamrick.\nMARK HAMRICK. Mr. Chairman, Mark Hamrick with Bankrate. You’ve talked in the\npast about getting the housing market back into better balance—excuse me—and also that the\nmarket might have bottomed. Where do you see that situation in balance, or lack thereof, right\nnow, particularly with the restrained, constrained inventory of existing homes that might\notherwise be coming onto market at a time when existing homeowners are reluctant to move and,\nof course, also all of that happening with the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage still around 7 percent\non the heels of Fed tightening and with what you’re talking about tightening industry lending\nstandards? Are we getting closer to balance or farther away? What’s your sense?\nCHAIR POWELL. I think we’ve got a ways to go to get back to balance, really, for the\nreasons that you talked about. With existing homes, you know, there are many people who have\nlow-rate mortgages, and whereas they might want to sell in a normal situation, they’re not going\nto because they have such, so much, value in their mortgage, whch means that supply of existing\nhomes is really, really tight, which is keeping prices up.\nOn the other hand, there’s, you know, there’s a lot of supply coming on line now, and,\nand there are people coming in. A lot of the buyers are, are, you know, first-time buyers coming\nin, buying at, you know, with these, you know, with these relatively elevated mortgage rates.\nBut I think this will take some time to work through. Hopefully, more supply comes on line,\nand, you know, we, we work through it. We’re still living through the, you know, the aftermath\nof the—of the pandemic.\nMICHELLE SMITH. We’ll go to Nancy for the last question.\nPage 27 of 28\nJuly 26, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nNANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Hi, Chair Powell. Nancy Marshall-Genzer with\nMarketplace. Russia has pulled out of an agreement allowing shipments of grains, safe passage\nthrough the Black Sea, and alternative routes at this point could be closed off. Just wondering,\nhow could that contribute to higher food prices and inflation generally, and how closely are you\nwatching that?\nCHAIR POWELL. We are watching it, of course, very closely. And you’re right. The\nwithdrawal from the Black Sea Grain Initiative does raise concerns about global food security,\nparticularly for poorer countries that import a large share of their food. Grain prices did go up on\nthis news, but they remain well below their peaks of last spring. And the moves that we’ve seen\nso far, I would say, are not expected to make a significant contribution to U.S. inflation. Of\ncourse, we will be watching that situation carefully.\nNANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. So you don’t think it would have a big effect on Fed\npolicy at this point?\nCHAIR POWELL. Doesn’t. You wouldn’t say so looking at what we—what we\nknow now.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Thanks very much.\nPage 28 of 28"

    "press_conf": "September 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nTranscript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference\nSeptember 20, 2023\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon, everyone. My colleagues and I remain squarely\nfocused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the\nAmerican people. We understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain\nstrongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal. Price stability is the\nresponsibility of the Federal Reserve. Without price stability, the economy does not work for\nanyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong\nlabor market conditions that benefit all.\nSince early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary\npolicy. We’ve raised our policy interest rate by 5¼ percentage points and have continued to\nreduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace. We’ve covered a lot of ground, and the full effects\nof our tightening have yet to be felt. Today, we decided to leave our policy interest rate\nunchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings. Looking ahead, we’re in a position\nto proceed carefully in determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be\nappropriate. Our decisions will be based on our ongoing assessments of the incoming data and\nthe evolving outlook and risks. I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly\nreviewing economic developments.\nRecent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace, and,\nso far this year, growth in real GDP has come in above expectations. Recent readings on\nconsumer spending have been particularly robust. Activity in the housing sector has picked up\nsomewhat, though it remains well below levels of a year ago, largely reflecting higher mortgage\nrates. Higher interest rates also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment. In our\nSummary of Economic Projections, or SEP, Committee participants revised up their assessments\nPage 1 of 28\nSeptember 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nof real GDP growth, with the median for this year now at 2.1 percent. Participants expect growth\nto cool, with the median projection falling to 1.5 percent next year.\nThe labor market remains tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into\nbetter balance. Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 150,000 jobs per month, a\nstrong pace that is nevertheless well below that seen earlier in the year. The unemployment rate\nticked up in August but remains low at 3.8 percent. The labor force participation rate has moved\nup since late last year, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years. Nominal wage growth\nhas shown some signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year. Although the\njobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers.\nFOMC participants expect the rebalancing in the labor market to continue, easing upward\npressures on inflation. The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP rises from\n3.8 percent at the end of this year to 4.1 percent over the next two years.\nInflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. Based on the consumer\nprice index, or CPI, and other data, we estimate that total PCE prices rose 3.4 percent over the\n12 months ending in August and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core\nPCE prices rose 3.9 percent. Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year,\nand longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad\nrange of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial\nmarkets. Nevertheless, the progress—process of getting inflation sustainably down to 2 percent\nhas a long way to go. The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 3.3 percent this\nyear, falls to 2.5 percent next year, and reaches 2 percent in 2026.\nThe Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware\nPage 2 of 28\nSeptember 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthat high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for\nthose least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We\nare highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we’re\nstrongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.\nAs I noted earlier, since early last year, we have raised our policy rate by 5¼ percentage\npoints. We see the current stance of monetary policy as restrictive, putting downward pressure\non economic activity, hiring, and inflation. In addition, the economy is facing headwinds from\ntighter credit conditions for households and businesses. In light of how far we have come in\ntightening policy, the Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the\nfederal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our\nsecurities holdings.\nWe are committed to achieving and sustaining a stance of monetary policy that is\nsufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our 2 percent goal over time. In our SEP,\nFOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path for the\nfederal funds rate, based on what each participant judges to be the most likely—sorry—the most\nlikely scenario going forward. If the economy evolves as projected, the median participant\nprojects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 5.6 percent at the end of this\nyear, 5.1 percent at the end of 2024, and 3.9 percent at the end of 2025. Compared with our June\nSummary of Economic Projections, the median projection is unrevised for the end of this year\nbut has moved up by ½ percentage point at the end of the next two years. These projections, of\ncourse, are not a Committee decision or plan; if the economy does not evolve as projected, the\npath of policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our maximum-employment and price-stability\ngoals. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the\nPage 3 of 28\nSeptember 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nincoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation, as well\nas the balance of risks.\nGiven how far we have come, we are in a position to proceed carefully as we assess the\nincoming data and the evolving outlook and risks. Real interest rates now are well above\nmainstream estimates of the neutral policy rate, but we are mindful of the inherent uncertainties\nin precisely gauging the stance of policy. We’re prepared to raise rates further if appropriate,\nand we intend to hold policy at a restrictive level until we’re confident that inflation is moving\ndown sustainably toward our objective. In determining the extent of additional policy firming\nthat may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into\naccount the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy\naffects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.\nWe remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to\nkeeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Reducing inflation is likely to require\na period of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions. Restoring price\nstability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over\nthe longer run.\nTo conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and\nbusinesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the\nFed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.\nThank you, and I look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Colby.\nCOLBY SMITH. Thank you. Colby Smith with the Financial Times. What makes the\nCommittee inclined to think that the fed funds rate at this level is not yet sufficiently restrictive,\nPage 4 of 28\nSeptember 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nespecially when officials are forecasting a slightly more benign inflation outlook for this year?\nThere’s noted uncertainty about policy lags. Headwinds have emerged from the looming\ngovernment shutdown, the end of federal childcare funding, resumption of student debt\npayments—things of that nature.\nCHAIR POWELL. So I guess I would characterize the, the situation a little bit\ndifferently. So we decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate where it is—at\n5¼ to 5½ percent—while continuing to reduce our securities holdings. And we say we’re\ncommitted to achieving and sustaining a stance of monetary policy that’s sufficiently restrictive\nto bring down inflation to 2 percent over time—we said that. But the fact that we decided to\nmaintain the policy rate at this meeting doesn’t mean that we’ve decided that we have or have\nnot at this time reached that—that stance of monetary policy that we’re seeking. If you looked at\nthe SEP, as you—as you obviously will have done, you will see that a majority of participants\nbelieve that it is more likely than not that we will—that it will be appropriate for us to raise rates\none more time in the two remaining meetings this year. Others believe that we have already\nreached that. So it’s, it’s something where we’re—by, by—we’re not making a decision by, by\ndeciding to—about that question by deciding to just maintain the rate and await further data.\nCOLBY SMITH. So, right now, it’s still an open question about “sufficiently\nrestrictive”—you’re not saying today that we’ve reached this level?\nCHAIR POWELL. We’re not saying—yeah, no, no—clearly, we’re just—what we\ndecided to do is maintain a policy rate and await further data. We want to see convincing\nevidence, really, that we have reached the appropriate level, and then, you know, we’re—\nwe’ve—we’ve seen progress, and, and we welcome that. But, you know, we need to see more\nprogress before we’ll be willing to—to reach that conclusion.\nPage 5 of 28\nSeptember 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCOLBY SMITH. And just on the 2024 projections—what’s behind that shallower path\nfor interest rate cuts and the need for real rates to be 50 basis points higher?\nCHAIR POWELL. Right. So I would say it this way: First of all, interest rates—real\ninterest rates are, are positive now. They’re meaningfully positive, and that’s a good thing. We\nneed policy to be restrictive so that we can get inflation down to target. Okay. And we need—\nwe’re going to need that to remain to be the case for some time. So I think, you know—\nremember that the—of course, the SEP is not a plan that is negotiated or discussed, really, as a\nplan. It’s a cumulation, really, and what you see are the medians. It’s a cumulation of individual\nforecasts from 19 people, and then what you’re seeing are the medians. So I wouldn’t want to,\nyou know, bestow upon it the idea that, that it’s really a plan. But what it reflects, though, is that\neconomic activity’s been stronger than we expected—stronger than I think everyone expected.\nAnd, and so what you’re—what you’re seeing is, this is what people believe, as of now, will be\nappropriate to achieve what we’re looking to achieve, which is progress toward our—toward our\ninflation goal, as you see in the SEP.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thanks. Let’s go to Rachel.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Hi, Chair Powell. Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. Thanks\nfor taking our questions. How would you characterize the debate around another hike or holding\nsteady? Is it discussion around lag times, fear of too much slowing, too little slowing? Could\nyou walk us through what this disagreement was about at the meeting?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah. So the proposal at the meeting was to—was to maintain our\ncurrent policy stance, and, and I think there was obviously unanimous support for that. But this,\nof course, is an SEP meeting, and so people write down what they think. And you’ve got—you\nhave some—you saw, I think—seven wrote down no hike at this—at this meeting—or between\nPage 6 of 28\nSeptember 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nnow and the end of the year. And I think 12 wrote down another single hike in one of the next\ntwo meetings that we have between the end of the year. So it wasn’t like we were arguing over\nthat—people just stating their positions—and, really, what, what people are saying is, “Let’s see\nhow the data come in.” You know, we, we want to see—you know what we want to see. We\nwant to see that, that this, this—these good inflation readings that we’ve been seeing for the last\nthree months—we want to see that it’s more than just three months, right? We want to see, you\nknow—the, the labor market report that we received, the last one that we received, was a good\nexample of what we do—of what we do want to see. It was a combination of, of, you know,\nof—across a broad range of indicators, continuing rebalancing of the labor market. So those are\nthe two things—so those are our two mandate variables, and, and that’s, that’s the progress that\nwe want to see. But I think people—they want to be convinced, you know—they want to be\ncareful to—not to jump to a conclusion, really, one way or the other—but just be convinced that\nthe data, you know, support that conclusion. And that’s why, given how far we’ve come and\nhow quickly we’ve come, we’re actually in a position to be able to proceed carefully as we\nassess the incoming data and the evolving outlooks and risks and make these decisions meeting\nby meeting.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. I see. And, in your view, what would—I know nothing has been\ndecided yet—but what would one more hike at the end of the year do to the economy or to\ninflation? And on the other side, what would no hike do, if you could sort of game that out\nfor us?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, you know, you, you can make the argument that one hike one\nway or the other won’t matter. But, for us, we’re, we’re trying—obviously, as a group, it’s a\npretty tight cluster of, of where we think that, that policy stance might be, but we’re always\nPage 7 of 28\nSeptember 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ngoing to be learning from data. You know, we’ve learned all through the course of the last year\nthat, actually, we needed to go further than we had thought. If you go back a year—and what we\nthought, what we wrote down—it’s actually gotten higher and higher. So we, we don’t really\nknow until—and that’s why, again, we—we’re in a position to proceed carefully at this point. A\nyear ago, we proceeded pretty quickly to get rates up. Now—now we’re fairly close, we think,\nto where we need to get. It’s, it’s just a question of reaching the right stance. I wouldn’t\nattribute huge importance to one hike in, in macroeconomic terms. Nonetheless, you know, we\nneed—we need to get to a place where we’re confident that we have a stance that will bring\ninflation down to 2 percent over time. That’s what we need to get to, and we’ve been—you\nknow, we’ve been moving toward it. As we’ve gotten closer to it, we’ve slowed the pace at\nwhich we’ve moved. I think that was appropriate. And now that we’re getting closer, we, we—\nagain, we have the ability to proceed carefully.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thanks. Let’s go to Steve.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Mr. Chairman, I want to return to Colby’s\nquestion here. What is it saying about the Committee’s view of the inflation dynamic in the\neconomy that you achieve the same forecast inflation rate for next year but need another half a\npoint of the funds rate on it? Does it tell you that—does it tell us that the Committee believes\ninflation to be more persistent—requires more medicine, effectively? And I guess a related\nquestion is, if you’re going to project a funds rate above the longer-run rate for four years in a\nrow, at what point do we start to think, “Hey, maybe the longer rate or the neutral rate is actually\nhigher”? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So I, I guess I would point more to—rather than pointing to a sense\nof inflation having become more persistent, I wouldn’t think—that’s not—we’ve, we’ve seen\nPage 8 of 28\nSeptember 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ninflation be more persistent over the course of the past year, but I wouldn’t say that’s something\nthat’s appeared in the recent data. It’s more about stronger economic activity, I would say. So\nif, if I had to attribute one thing—again, we’re, we’re picking medians here and trying to\nattribute one explanation. But I think, broadly, stronger economic activity means, means rates—\nwe have to do more with rates, and that’s what—that’s what that meaning is, is telling you. In\nterms of, of what the neutral rate can be—you know, we—we know it by its works. We only\nknow it by its works, really. We can’t—we can’t—you know, the, the models and, and—that we\nuse, you—ultimately, you only know when you get there and by, by the way the economy reacts.\nAnd, again, that’s another reason why we’re—why we’re moving carefully now, because, you\nknow, there are lags here. So it, it may—it may, of course, be that the—that the neutral rate has\nrisen. You do see people—you don’t see the median moving—but you do see people raising\ntheir estimates of, of the neutral rate, and it’s certainly plausible that the neutral rate is higher\nthan, than the longer-run rate. Remember—what we write down in the SEP is the longer-run\nrate. It is certainly possible that, you know, that the—that the neutral rate at this moment is\nhigher than that, and that—that’s part of the explanation for why the economy has been more\nresilient than, than expected.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Howard.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Howard Schneider with Reuters. Thank you. So you’ve said\nseveral times that the economy needed a period of below-trend growth to get inflation\nconsistently back to 2 percent. You kind of get that in 2024 a little bit—1.5 percent is just a\ntouch below what’s the estimate of potential. So the fact that you’re getting so much done at so\nmuch less cost, does that represent a change in how you think inflation works, a change in how\nPage 9 of 28\nSeptember 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nyou think the economy works, a change in the mix of supply healing versus demand destruction\nthat’s necessary to achieve this?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes, of course. It is a—it is a good thing that we, we’ve seen now\nmeaningful rebalancing in the labor market without an increase in unemployment, and that’s,\nthat’s because we’re seeing that rebalancing in other places—in, for example, job openings and\nin the jobs–worker gap. You’re also seeing supply-side things—so, so that’s happening. I would\nsay, though, we still—I still think, and I think, broadly, people still think, that there will have to\nbe some softening in the labor market that can come through more supply, as we’ve seen as well.\nAlso, remember, the natural rate, we think, is, is coming down, which is a supply-side thing, so\nthat the, the gap between any given unemployment rate that’s lower than that and the natural rate\ncomes down. That’s a way for supply—that’s a way for the labor market to achieve a better\nbalance. So all of those things are happening. You’re right—in, in the median forecast, we\ndon’t see a big increase in unemployment. We do see an increase, and—but that’s—that really is\njust “playing forward” the trends that we’ve been seeing. That is not guaranteed. There, there\nmay come a time when unemployment goes up more than that, but that’s, that’s really what\nwe’ve been seeing is, progress without higher unemployment for now.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. So just to, to boil that down for a second—you know, we’ve\ngone from a very narrow path to a—to a soft landing to something different. Would you call the\nsoft landing now a baseline expectation?\nCHAIR POWELL. No, no—I would not do that. I, I would just say—what, what would\nI say about that? I’ve always thought that the soft landing was, was a plausible outcome—that\nthere was a path, really, to, to a soft landing. I’ve thought that, and I’ve said that since we lifted\noff. It’s also possible that, that the path has narrowed, and it’s widened, apparently. Ultimately,\nPage 10 of 28\nSeptember 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nit—this may be decided by factors that are outside our control at the end of the day. But I do\nthink it’s—I do think it’s possible. And, you know—I also think, you know, this is why we’re in\na position to, to move carefully again. That—we, we will restore price stability. We, we know\nthat we have to do that, and we know the public depends on us doing that, and we know that we\nhave to do it so that we can achieve the kind of labor market that we all want to achieve, which is\nan extended period—sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. We\nknow that. The fact that we’ve come this far lets us really proceed carefully, as I keep saying.\nSo I think, you know, that’s, that’s the end we’re trying to achieve. I wouldn’t want to handicap\nthe likelihood of it, though. It’s not up to me to do that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nick.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, both you and\nVice Chair Williams have indicated that “sufficiently restrictive” will be judged on a real rather\nthan nominal basis, implying some scope for nominal rate cuts next year—provided further\ncompelling evidence that price pressures will continue to subside. Is the FOMC focused on\ntargeting a real level of policy restriction? And can you explain what would constitute enough\nevidence that will allow the FOMC to normalize the nominal stance of policy while keeping real\npolicy settings sufficiently restrictive?\nCHAIR POWELL. I mean, yes—we, we understand that it’s a real rate that will matter\nand that needs to be sufficiently restrictive. And, again, I would say, you know—you know\n“sufficiently restrictive” only when you see it. You—it’s not something you can arrive at with\nconfidence in a model or, or in various estimates, you know. And so what are we seeing?\nWe’re, we’re seeing, you know, through a combination of the, you know, the unwinding of the\npandemic-related demand and supply distortions and monetary policy’s work in suppressing\nPage 11 of 28\nSeptember 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ndemand or, or, you know, alleviating very high demand—the combination of those two things is\nactually working. You’re seeing, you know, inflation coming down. It’s principally now in\ngoods—also in housing services. You begin to see effects of it in nonhousing services as well.\nSo I think—we think that that is working. And I, I think, you know—as we’ve said, we, we want\nto reach that—we want to reach something that we’re confident gets us to that level. And I think\nconfidence comes from seeing, you know, enough data that you feel like, “Yes, okay, this feels\nlike it—we can—we can, for now, decide that this is the right level and just agree to stay here.”\nWe’re not permanently deciding not to go higher, but, but we would—let’s say, if we get to that\nlevel—and then the question is, how long do you stay at that level? And that’s a whole other set\nof questions. For now, the question is trying to find that level where we think we can stay there.\nAnd we haven’t—we haven’t gotten to a point of confidence about that yet. That’s, that’s what\nwe’re—that’s, that’s the stage we’re at, though.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. But it looks like there was—because there was an across-the-board\ndrop in the core PCE projection—core PCE inflation projection for this year, and even then it\nseems possible that core PCE inflation could come in even lower than the median at 3.7 percent.\nWould you see a case to raise rates still if it turned out that you were going to achieve the same\nreal rate this year because the decline in inflation proceeds somewhat better than you—than you\ncurrently anticipate?\nCHAIR POWELL. The decision that we make at, you know, at each meeting and,\ncertainly, at the—at the last two meetings this year—it’s going to depend on the totality of all the\ndata: so, the inflation data, the labor market data, the growth data, the, the balance of risks, and\nthe other events that are happening out there. We’ll make—we take all of that into account, so I\ncan’t really answer a hypothetical about one piece of that. It’ll—it’ll be trying to reach a\nPage 12 of 28\nSeptember 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\njudgment over whether we should move forward with another rate hike overall and whether that\nwould increase our confidence that, that, yes, this is an appropriate move, and it will help, help\nus be more confident that we’ve gotten to the level that we need to get to.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jeanna.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Thanks, Chair Powell. Following up on Nick’s question,\nactually—John Williams, the New York Fed president, obviously, has said things to the effect of,\n“Next year, as we see inflation kind of”—again, to Nick’s point—“as, as we see inflation coming\ndown, we’re going to need to reduce interest rates to make sure that we’re not squeezing the\neconomy harder and harder over time.” And I wonder if that’s basically the logic that you\napply—you know, is that how you think about it? And then I also wonder—in the last press\nconference, you said something to the effect of, you know, “It’s a full year out—those\ndiscussions,” and people interpreted that to mean that you didn’t see a possibility of a rate cut in\nthe first half of next year. And I wonder if that was what you meant by that or whether, you\nknow—how you’re thinking about that timing.\nCHAIR POWELL. No. When—so when I answer these questions about hypotheticals\nabout, about cutting, I’m never intending to send a signal about timing; I’m just answering them\nas, as the question is expressed. So, so please—I, I wouldn’t want to be taken that way. Sorry—\nthe first question was, is that how? Yeah, so we’re—as we go into next year, that’s the question\nwe’ll be asking is—you know, taking into account lags and, and everything else we know about\nthe economy and everything we know about monetary policy, the, the time will come at some\npoint, and I’m not saying when, that it’s—that it’s appropriate to cut. Part of that may be that\nreal rates are rising because inflation is coming down. Part of it just may be that—it’ll be all the\nfactors that we see in the economy. And, you know, that time will certainly come at some point.\nPage 13 of 28\nSeptember 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nAnd you—what you see is us writing down, you know, a year ahead, estimates of what that\nmight be. And, you know, there’s—you know, there’s so much uncertainty around that. In, in—\nwhen we—in the moment, we’ll do what we think makes sense. No one will look back at this\nand say, “Hey, we made a plan.” It’s not like that at all. It’s—this is—these are estimates made\na year in advance that are highly uncertain, and that’s how it is.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Neil.\nNEIL IRWIN. Thanks so much, Chair Powell. Neil Irwin with Axios. I wonder—how\ndo you think about the question of whether the strong GDP growth we’ve been seeing is driven\nby excess demand versus supply-side factors, productivity, labor force growth? And, relatedly,\nif GDP keeps coming in “hot,” even in the absence of inflation resurgence, would that on its own\nbe a reason to consider more tightening?\nCHAIR POWELL. So on, on your first question—I mean, we’re looking at GDP very,\nvery carefully to try to understand really what’s the direction of it—what’s, what’s driving it.\nAnd it’s, it’s a lot of consumer spending, you know. It’s been—the consumer’s been very robust\nin its—in spending. So that is, you know, that’s how we’re looking at it. Sorry, your second\nquestion was—\nNEIL IRWIN. Does GDP stays “hot,” but without inflation?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I, I think the question will be—GDP is not our mandate, right?\nMaximum employment and price stability are the mandates. The question will be, is, is the\nlevel—is GDP—is the—is the heat that we see in GDP—is it really a threat to our ability to get\nback to 2 percent inflation? That’s going to be the question. It’s not—it’s not a question about\nGDP on its own. It’s, you—you know, you’re expecting to see the—this improvement, you\nknow—continued rebalancing in the labor market and inflation moving back down to 2 percent\nPage 14 of 28\nSeptember 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nin a sustainable way. We have to have confidence in that, and, you know, we’d be—we’d be\nlooking at GDP just, just to the extent that it threatens one or both of those.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi. Victoria Guido with Politico. There are multiple external\nfactors that are playing out right now. We see rising oil prices. We see auto workers striking.\nThere’s the looming, very real possibility of a government shutdown. And I was just wondering,\nfor each of those things, could you talk about how you’re thinking about how that might affect\nthe course for the Fed and the economy?\nCHAIR POWELL. So there is a—there is a long list, and you hit some of them. But it—\nyou know, it’s, it’s the strike, it’s government shutdown, resumption of student loan payments,\nhigher long-term rates, oil price shock. You know, you could—there are a lot of things that you\ncan—you can look at. And, you know—so, what we try to do is assess all of them and, and\nhandicap all of them. And, ultimately, though, there’s so much uncertainty around, around these\nthings. I mean, to, to start with the strike—first of all, we absolutely don’t comment on the\nstrike, as we have no view on the strike one way or the other. But we, we do have to make an\nassessment of its economic effects to do our jobs. So, you know, the, the thing about it is—so\nuncertain. It will depend. The economic effects—it could affect—you’ve looked—we’ve\nlooked back at history—it could affect economic output, hiring, and inflation. But that’s really\ngoing to depend on how broad it is and how long it’s sustained for. And we—and then it also\ndepends on how quickly production can make up for, for lost production. So none of those\nthings are known right now. It’s very, very hard to know. So you just have to leave that\nuncertain. And, and we’ll be learning, I think, over the course of the next intermeeting period,\nmuch more about that. And the same is true for the others. We, we—I don’t know if you\nPage 15 of 28\nSeptember 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nmentioned shutdown; I think of all of these as being on the list. We don’t comment on that. It\nhasn’t traditionally had much of a macroeconomic effect.\nYou know, energy prices being higher—that’s—that is a significant thing. We—energy\nprices being up can affect spending. It can affect the consumer over time. A sustained period of\nhigher—of higher energy prices can affect consumer expectations about inflation. We tend to\nlook through short-term volatility and look at—look at core inflation. But so the question is,\nhow long are, are higher prices sustained? We have to—we have to take those macroeconomic\neffects into account as well. Those are—those are some of them. I’m not sure if I hit them all.\nBut—I mean, ultimately, you know, you’re, you’re coming into this with an economy that\nappears to have significant momentum. And that’s, that’s what we start with. And we—but we\ndo have this collection of risks that you mentioned.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Craig.\nCRAIG TORRES. Craig Torres from Bloomberg News. I was a little surprised, Chair\nPowell, to hear you say that a soft landing is not a primary objective. This economy’s seeing\nadded supply in a way that could create long-term inflation stability. We have prime-age labor\nforce participation moving up where people can add skills. Workers want to work. We have a\nboom in manufacturing construction. We’ve had a decent spate of homebuilding. And since\ninflation’s coming down with strong GDP growth, we may have higher productivity. All are\nwhich—good for the Fed’s longer-run target of low inflation. And if we lose that in a recession,\naren’t we opting for the awful hysteresis that we had in 2010? So are you taking this into\naccount as you pursue policy? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. To begin: A soft landing is a primary objective, and I did not say\notherwise. I mean, that’s, that’s what we’ve been trying to achieve for all this time.\nPage 16 of 28\nSeptember 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nThe, the real point, though, is—the, the worst thing we can do is to fail to restore price\nstability, because the record is clear on that: If you, you don’t restore price stability, inflation\ncomes back, and you go through—you can have a long period where the economy’s just very\nuncertain, and it will affect growth; it will affect all kinds of things. It can be a miserable period\nto have inflation constantly coming back and the Fed coming in and having to tighten again and\nagain. So the best thing we can do for everyone, we believe, is to restore price stability. I think\nnow, today, we actually—you know, we, we have the ability to be careful at this point and move\ncarefully, and that’s what we’re planning to do. So we fully appreciate that—you know, the\nbenefits of being able to continue what we see already, which is rebalancing in the labor market\nand inflation coming down without seeing, you know, an important, large increase in\nunemployment, which has been typical of other tightening cycles. So—\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Chris.\nCHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Hi. Thank you. Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.\nWhen you look at the disinflation that has taken place so far, do you see it mostly as a result of\nwhat some economists are calling “the low-hanging fruit”—such as the unwinding of supply\nchain snarls and other pandemic disruptions—or is it more a broad disinflationary trend that\ninvolves most goods and services across the economy? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So if I—if I understood your question, it’s—I would say it this way:\nI think we knew from the time—from before when we lifted off, but certainly by the time we\nlift—we knew that bringing inflation back down was going to take, as I call it, the unwinding of\nthese distortions to both supply and demand that happened because of the pandemic and the\nresponse. So that unwinding was going to be important. In addition, monetary policy was going\nto help. It was going to help supply side heal by, by cooling demand off and, just in general,\nPage 17 of 28\nSeptember 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nbetter aligning supply with demand. So those two forces were always going to be important. I\nthink it’s very hard to pull them apart. They work together. I, I do think both of them are at\nwork now, and I think they’re at work in a way that shows you the progress that we—that we are\nseeing.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Mike.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio. In June,\nyou forecast a 5.6 percent year-end median fed funds rate, and since then, you’ve more than\ndoubled your growth forecast. You lowered your unemployment forecast significantly. So, what\nwould justify that last move, because the median forecast is for lower inflation? And given all\nthe known unknowns that you face, how much confidence do you have, can investors have, or\nthe American people have in your forecasts?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, forecasts are highly uncertain. Forecasting is very difficult.\nForecasters are a humble lot with much to be humble about. But to get to, to your question,\nthough—what’s happened is, growth has come in stronger, right? Stronger than expected—and\nthat’s required higher rates. Unemployment, you know—you also see that the, the ultimate\nunemployment rate is not as high, but that—that’s really because of what we’ve been seeing in\nthe labor market. We’ve seen more and more progress in the labor market without seeing\nsignificantly higher unemployment. So we’re, we’re continuing that trend. In terms of inflation,\nyou, you are seeing—the last three readings are, are very good readings. It’s only three readings,\nyou know. We—we’re well aware that we need to see more than three readings. But if you look\nat June, July, and August, you’re looking at, you know, really significant declines in core\ninflation, largely in the goods sector—also to some extent in housing services and just a little in\nnonhousing services. Those are the three buckets. Headline inflation, of course, has come way\nPage 18 of 28\nSeptember 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ndown, largely due to lower energy prices, some of which is now reversing. So I think—people\nshould know that, that economic forecasting is very difficult, and these are highly uncertain\nforecasts. But these are—these are our forecasts. You know, they’re, they’re—we have very\nhigh-quality people working on these forecasts, and I think they stand up well against other\nforecasters. But just the nature of the business is, the economy is very difficult to forecast.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Given the—given the forecast that you have, what justified not\nmoving today, and what could justify moving in the future if you think inflation is coming\ndown? In other words, why did you leave that extra dot in?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, I, I think we have come very far very fast in, in the, the rate\nincreases that we’ve made. And I think it was important at the beginning that we move quickly,\nand we did. And, and I think as we get closer to the rate that we think—the stance of monetary\npolicy that we think is appropriate to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time, you know, the\nrisks become more two sided, and the risk of overtightening and the risk of, of undertightening\nbecomes more equal. And I think the, the natural, commonsense thing to do is, as you approach\nthat, you move a little more slowly as you get closer to it. And that, that’s what we’re doing. So\nwe’re, we’re taking advantage of the fact that we have moved quickly to move a little more\ncarefully now as we—as we sort of find our way to, to the right level of restriction that we need\nto get inflation back down to 2 percent.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jennifer.\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. Thank you, Chair Powell. Jennifer Schonberger with\nYahoo Finance. With your focus on year-over-year PCE, isn’t it true that base effects are huge\nand that by the time you meet in November, that it’s more likely that you’ll have a low PCE\nnumber that would make you feel more comfortable? And, secondly, how would the lack of key\nPage 19 of 28\nSeptember 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nindicators—like CPI, the jobs report—impact your approach in upcoming meetings if we were to\nhave a government shutdown? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Sorry—yeah, I missed the first question. What was—missed what\nfactors?\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. The base factors.\nCHAIR POWELL. Base factors. Ah. Okay. So on that, we’re, you know, we’re\nlooking at just monthly, right? You can look at just monthly readings and see what the increase\nwas from the prior month. So you’re right—when you go back 3, 6, and 12 months, you get base\nfactors. But we can—we can adjust for that. In terms of not getting data—you know, again, we\ndon’t—we don’t comment on government shutdowns. It—it’s possible—if, if there is a\ngovernment shutdown and it lasts through the, the next meeting, then it’s possible we wouldn’t—\nwe wouldn’t be getting some of the data that we would ordinarily get, and we—you know, we\nwould just have to deal with that. And I don’t know. It’s hard for me to say in advance how that\nwould affect that meeting. It would depend on all kinds of factors that I don’t know about now.\nBut it’s certainly a reality that, that that’s a possibility.\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. Would you feel more comfortable on the base effects\nthat—as those kind of fall out of the equation for the next couple of readings by November,\nwould you feel more comfortable at that point?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, yes. I mean, if you’re looking—if—we, we can tell how\nmuch inflation has gone up in a given month, right? And, you know, that’s what we’re looking\nat. And month by month, what’s the reading? And, you know, I think—I think what we’re\nreally looking at is, there’s a tendency to look at, you know, shorter and shorter maturities, but\nthey’re incredibly volatile, and they can be misleading. That’s why we look at 12-month [rates].\nPage 20 of 28\nSeptember 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nBut I think, in this situation—where it looks like we’ve had a bit of a turn in inflation starting in\nJune—we’re also looking at six months, and even three months, but really six months’ inflation.\nSo you’re looking at it over that period and over longer periods. That—that’s the right way to\ngo. And we don’t—we don’t need to be in a hurry to—in, in getting to a conclusion about what\nto do. We can let the data evolve. So—\nMICHELLE SMITH. Edward.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thanks for the question, Chair Powell. Edward Lawrence\nwith Fox Business. So I want to focus back in on oil prices. We’re seeing oil prices, as you\nmentioned, move up, and that’s pushing the price of gas. So how does that factor into your\ndecision to raise rates or not—because in the last two inflation reports, PCE and CPI, we’ve\nseen, the overall inflation has actually risen?\nCHAIR POWELL. Right. So, you know, energy prices are very important for the\nconsumer. This, this can affect consumer spending. It certainly can affect consumer sentiment.\nI mean, gas prices are one of the big things that, that affects consumer sentiment. It, it really\ncomes down to how persistent—how sustained these energy prices are. The reason why we look\nat core inflation, which excludes food and energy, is that energy goes up and down like that.\nAnd it doesn’t—energy, energy prices mostly, mostly don’t contain much of a signal about how\ntight the economy is, and hence don’t tell you much about where inflation’s really going.\nHowever, we’re well aware, though, that, that, you know, if energy prices increase and stay high,\nthat’ll have an effect on spending. And, and it may have an effect on, on consumer expectations\nof inflation—things like that. That’s just things we have to monitor.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. On the consumer—they’re putting more and more of this on\ntheir credit card. The consumer is seeing, you know, record credit spending. How long do you\nPage 21 of 28\nSeptember 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthink the consumer can manage that debt at higher interest rates now? And are you concerned\nabout a, a debt bubble related to that?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, to, to finish my prior thought, I was saying that’s why we tend to\nlook through energy moves that we—that we can see as, as short-term volatility. You know,\nturning to consumer credit, you know—of course, we watch that carefully. Consumer distress—\nmeasures of distress among consumers were at historic lows quite recently, you know, after—\nduring and after the, the pandemic. They’re now moving back up to normal. We’re, we’re\nwatching that carefully. But, at this point, these, these readings are not at troublingly high levels.\nThey’re, they’re just kind of moving back up to what was the typical [level] in the pre-pandemic\nera.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jean.\nJEAN YUNG. Hi. Jean Yung with MNI Market News. Yields along the Treasury curve\nhave risen to their highest in years. What is the Fed’s view about what’s been driving that\nincrease in recent weeks, and how much of it can be attributed to macro explanations—and how\nmuch to technical factors?\nCHAIR POWELL. So you’re right. You know, rates have moved up significantly. I\nthink it’s always hard to say precisely, but it’s—most, most people do a common decomposition\nof the increase, and they’ll, they’ll—the view will be, it’s not—it’s not mostly about inflation\nexpectations. It’s mostly about other things, you know—either term premium or real yields—\nand it’s, it’s hard to be precise about this. Of course, everyone’s got models that’ll give you a\nvery precise answer, but they give you different answers. So—but, essentially, they’re, they’re\nmoving up because—it’s not because of inflation. It’s because probably—it’ll probably have\nPage 22 of 28\nSeptember 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nsomething to do with stronger growth, I would say—more, more supply of Treasuries. You\nknow, the common explanations that you hear in the markets kind of make sense.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Kyle.\nKYLE CAMPBELL. Kyle Campbell, American Banker. Thank you for taking the\nquestions—just two on, on housing. You’ve said slower shelter cost growth is in the pipeline\nand will reflect in inflation readings as new leases are signed, but there’s also some questions out\nthere about the way housing costs are measured, particularly the use of rental equivalents, which\nare estimates from homeowners about what their homes would rent for if they were in the rental\nmarket. So my question is, how much of the effort to tame inflation, both as it’s measured and\nfelt by the broader public, hinges on housing supply? And then as far as a constrained housing\nsupply being sort of exacerbated by this sort of lock-in effect of mortgages being higher now\nthan they were at their recent historic lows, how is that going to impact future thinking about\ntaking interest rates to that lower bound in the future?\nCHAIR POWELL. So on the supply point—of course, supply is very important over\ntime in, in setting house prices and, and, for that matter, rents. And so—and supply is kind of\nstructurally constrained. But in terms of, of where inflation’s going in the near term, though, as,\nas you obviously know, a lot of it is, is leases that are running off and then being re-signed or re-\nleased at a level that’s, that’s not as—it won’t be that much higher. A year ago, it would have\nbeen much higher than it was a year before; now it may be below or at the same level. So as\nthose leases are rolling over, we’re, we’re seeing what we expect, which is measured housing\nservices inflation coming down. Your second question was the lock-ins. How much is that\naffecting things, really?\nPage 23 of 28\nSeptember 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nKYLE CAMPBELL. Is that going to affect your decisions to potentially bring rates\ndown to their lower bound in the future, sort of creating that sort of bubble of buying and then a\nlock-in that sort of stagnates the housing market?\nCHAIR POWELL. I, I think we look at the—I would look at the lock-in, the, the idea\nbeing that people are in, in very low mortgage—very low-rate mortgages, and if—even if they\nwant to move now, they—it would be hard because the new mortgage would be so expensive.\nAnd that’s explaining some of the—that’s one of the explanations for what’s happening broadly\nin the labor market. Would that play a role in, in our future decisions—in a—in a future tight—\nin a future loosening cycle about whether we would cut rates? No, I, I don’t think it would. I\nmean, I don’t think that’s—I, I think we’d be looking at, what, you know, fundamentally, what,\nwhat rates does the economy need? And, and, you know, in, in an emergency like the pandemic\nor during the Global Financial Crisis, you, you know, the, the—you have to cut rates to the point\nthat—you have to do, do what you can to support the economy. So I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t think\nthat that would be a reason for us not to do that. It’s not something we’re thinking about at all\nright now. But, down the road, I wouldn’t think so.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nancy.\nNANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Hi. Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace. Chair\nPowell, you’ve mentioned several things that would possibly weigh on consumer confidence,\nmaybe cut back consumer spending—possible government shutdown, high gas prices. At this\npoint, would the Fed welcome a decrease in consumer spending? Would that help you get\ninflation closer to your 2 percent target?\nCHAIR POWELL. I, I wouldn’t say it that way. We’re not looking for a decrease in\nconsumer spending. It’s, it’s a good thing that the economy’s strong. It’s a good thing that the\nPage 24 of 28\nSeptember 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\neconomy has been able to hold up under, under the tightening that we’ve done. It’s a good thing\nthat the labor market’s strong. The, the only concern—it, it just means this: If the economy\ncomes in stronger than expected, that just means we’ll have to do more in terms of monetary\npolicy to get back to 2 percent—because we will get back to 2 percent. Does that answer your\nquestion?\nNANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Yeah. And I guess, on the other hand, would you\nworry that that could contribute to an economic slowdown or even a recession?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, that’s always a concern. I mean, concern number one is, is\nrestoring price stability, because in the long run, that’s, that’s something we have to do so that\nwe can have the kind of economy we really want, which is one with sustained period of tight\nlabor market conditions that benefit all, as I—as I’ve said a couple times. So that, that said—of\ncourse, you know—we, we also now, given how far we’ve come with our rate hikes and how\nquickly we’ve come here, we do have the ability to be careful as we move forward because of\nthat consideration.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Simon.\nSIMON RABINOVITCH. Thank you, Chair Powell. Simon Rabinovitch with the\nEconomist. One of the factors in the economic resilience to date appears to be a lesser degree of\nrate sensitivity than in the past. Obviously, we’ve talked about households with long fixed-rate\nmortgages—also companies that refinanced before last year. What is your thinking about the\nefficacy of rates and how that’s changed? And then, related to that, how do you think about the\ndistributional consequences in the sense that if you’re a relatively wealthy household with a long\nfixed-rate mortgage, the past year has not been all that tough with rates going up, whereas if\nPage 25 of 28\nSeptember 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nyou’re relying on your credit card for supporting your consumption, in fact, times are getting a\nlot tougher a lot more quickly? Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. So, what—I guess it’s fair—it’s fair to say that the economy has\nbeen stronger than many expected, given, given what’s been happening with, with interest rates.\nWhy is that? Many candidate explanations—possibly—a number of them make sense. One, one\nis just that household balance sheets and business balance sheets have been stronger than we had\nunderstood, and so that, that spending has held up—and that kind of thing. We’re not sure about\nthat. The savings rate for consumers has come down a lot. The question is whether that’s\nsustainable. That could—it could just mean that the—that the date of effect is, is later. It could\nalso be that for other reasons, the neutral rate of interest is, is higher for—for various reasons.\nWe don’t know that. It could also just be that policy hasn’t been restrictive enough for long\nenough. And it’s—there are many candidate explanations. We have to, in, in all this\nuncertainty, make policy, and I, you know, I feel like what we have right now is what’s still a\nvery strong labor market—but that’s coming back into balance. We were making progress on\ninflation. Growth is strong. But I think by many forecasts—many, many, many forecasts call\nfor growth to, to moderate over the course of the next year. So that’s where we are, and, you\nknow, we have to—we have to deal with what comes. On your second question, which was—\nsorry, your second question was distributional, but can you—can you be a little clearer\nabout that?\nSIMON RABINOVITCH. Yeah. My point there was that if you’re somebody who has a\nlong fixed-rate mortgage, you’ve been able to endure the higher rates relatively easily. If you’re\nsomebody who’s living month to month off of your credit card, current financing rates are, are\npunitive.\nPage 26 of 28\nSeptember 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes. And so the point I would make there is that we’re trying to get\ninflation back down. The people who are most hurt by inflation are the people who are on a\nfixed income. If you’re a person who spends all of your income, you don’t really have any\nmeaningful savings. You spend all your income on the basics of life—clothing, food,\ntransportation, heating—the basics—and prices go up by 5, 6, 7 percent, you’re in trouble right\naway, whereas even, even middle-class people have some savings and some ability to absorb\nthat. So it is for those people as much as for anybody that we need to restore price stability, and,\nand we, we want to do it as quickly as possible. Obviously, we—we’d like to do that. We’d like\nthe current trend to continue, which is that we’re making progress without seeing the kind of\nincrease in unemployment that we’ve seen past—in past things. But you’re right, though. When\nwe raise rates, people who are, you know, living on credit cards and, and borrowing are going to\nfeel that more. They are. And, of course, people with, with lots of savings also have a—have a\nmuch lower marginal propensity to consume, and so they’re not going to—it’s not going to affect\nthem as much.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Greg Robb for the last question.\nGREG ROBB. Thank you, Chair Powell. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. In the Beige\nBook recently, you can tell that the Fed has been surveying nonprofits and community groups\nabout the economic health of low-income Americans—moderate-income Americans. I have two\nquestions about this. Are you going to use that data to maybe come up with sort of like a\nquarterly survey of those groups—like the senior loan officer survey? And from your—and also\nthe second question is, from your recent look—readings of these surveys, how are low and\nmoderate Americans doing? Is there this thing where, like, the GDP is strong because of wealthy\nPage 27 of 28\nSeptember 20, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nAmericans kind of driving things? I just want to get your sense of the health of that sector.\nThank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So I, I don’t know about the quarterly survey. That’s an idea we\ncan—we can take away and think about. In terms of how low and moderate Americans—you\nknow, they’re clearly—were suffering from, from high inflation. I think during the pandemic,\nthe, the government transfers that happened were very meaningful. And, you know, if you know\nthe—the surveys that we take showed that—showed that low- and moderate-income people were\nactually in very, very strong financial condition. I think now it’s a very “hot” labor market, and\nyou’re seeing high [growth in] nominal wages, and you’re starting to see [that growth rates of]\nreal wages are now positive by most—by most measures. So I, I think, overall, households are\nin good shape.\nSurveys are a different thing. So surveys are showing dissatisfaction, and I think a lot of\nthat is just, people hate inflation—hate it. And that, that causes people to say, “The economy’s\nterrible.” But, at the same time, they’re spending money. Their behavior is, is not exactly what\nyou would expect from the surveys. That’s kind of a, a guess at what the answer might be. But\nI, I think there’s a lot of good things happening on household balance sheets—and, certainly, in\nthe labor market and with wages. The biggest wage increases having gone to relatively low-\nwage jobs—and now [with] inflation coming down—you’re seeing [increases in] real wages,\nwhich is a good thing.\nThanks very much.\nPage 28 of 28"

    "press_conf": "November 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nTranscript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference\nNovember 1, 2023\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome. My colleagues and I remain\nsquarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for\nthe American people. We understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain\nstrongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal. Price stability is the\nresponsibility of the Federal Reserve. Without price stability, the economy does not work for\nanyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong\nlabor market conditions that benefit all.\nSince early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary\npolicy. We have raised our policy interest rate by 5¼ percentage points and have continued to\nreduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace. The stance of policy is restrictive—meaning that\ntight policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation—and the full\neffects of our tightening have yet to be felt. Today, we decided to leave our policy interest rate\nunchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings. Given how far we have come,\nalong with the uncertainties and risks we face, the Committee is proceeding carefully. We will\nmake decisions about the extent of additional policy firming and how long policy will remain\nrestrictive based on the totality of the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of\nrisks. I’ll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic\ndevelopments.\nRecent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a strong pace and\nwell above earlier expectations. In the third quarter, real GDP is estimated to have risen at an\noutsized annual rate of 4.9 percent, boosted by a surge in consumer spending. After picking up\nsomewhat over the summer, activity in the housing sector has flattened out and remains well\nPage 1 of 27\nNovember 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nbelow levels of a year ago, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates also\nappear to be weighing on business fixed investment.\nThe labor market remains tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into\nbetter balance. Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 266,000 jobs per month, a\nstrong pace that is nevertheless below that seen earlier in the year. The unemployment rate\nremains low at 3.8 percent. Strong job creation has been accompanied by an increase in the\nsupply of workers. The labor force participation rate has moved up since late last year,\nparticularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years, and immigration has rebounded to pre-pandemic\nlevels. Nominal wage growth has shown some signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined\nso far this year. Although the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the\nsupply of available workers.\nInflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. Total PCE prices rose\n3.4 percent over the 12 months ending in September. Excluding the volatile food and energy\ncategories, core PCE prices rose 3.7 percent. Inflation has moderated since the middle of last\nyear, and readings over the summer were quite favorable. But a few months of good data are\nonly the beginning of what it will take to build confidence that inflation is moving down\nsustainably toward our goal. The process of getting inflation sustainably down to 2 percent has a\nlong way to go. Despite elevated inflation, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain\nwell anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and\nforecastters, as well as measures from financial markets.\nThe Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware\nthat high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for\nPage 2 of 27\nNovember 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthose least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We\nare highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are\nstrongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.\nAs I noted earlier, since early last year, we have raised our policy rate by 5¼ percentage\npoints, and we have decreased our securities holdings by more than $1 trillion. Our restrictive\nstance of monetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation. The\nCommittee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at\n5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings.\nWe are committed to achieving a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring\ninflation sustainably down to 2 percent over time, and to keeping policy restrictive until we are\nconfident that inflation is on a path to that objective.\nWe are attentive to recent data showing the resilience of economic growth and demand\nfor labor. Evidence of growth persistently above potential, or that tightness in the labor market is\nno longer easing, could put further progress on inflation at risk and could warrant further\ntightening of monetary policy.\nFinancial conditions have tightened significantly in recent months, driven by higher\nlonger-term bond yields, among other factors. Because persistent changes in financial conditions\ncan have implications for the path of monetary policy, we monitor financial developments\nclosely.\nIn light of the uncertainties and risks, and how far we have come, the Committee is\nproceeding carefully. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the\ntotality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and\ninflation as well as the balance of risks. In determining the extent of additional policy firming\nPage 3 of 27\nNovember 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthat may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into\naccount the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy\naffects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.\nWe remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to\nkeeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Reducing inflation is likely to require\na period of below-potential growth and some softening of labor market conditions. Restoring\nprice stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices\nover the longer run.\nTo conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and\nbusinesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the\nFed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.\nThank you, and I look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Howard.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Howard Schneider with Reuters. Thank you, Chair Powell,\nfor doing this. To what—you referenced the rise in long-term bond yields—to what degree did\nthat supplant action by the Fed at this meeting?\nCHAIR POWELL. Thanks for your question. So, I’ll talk about bond yields, but I want\nto take a second and just sort of set the broader context in which we’re looking at that. So, if\nyou—if you look at the situation—let’s look at the economy first. Inflation has been coming\ndown, but it’s still running well above our 2 percent target. The labor market has been\nrebalancing, but it’s still very tight by many measures. GDP growth has been strong, although\nmany forecasters are forecasting, and they have been forecasting, that it will slow.\nPage 4 of 27\nNovember 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nAs for the Committee, we are committed to achieving a stance of monetary policy that’s\nsufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time, and we’re not confident yet\nthat we have achieved such a stance. So that is the broader context into which this, this strong\neconomy and all the things I said—that’s the context in which we’re looking at this question of\nrates.\nSo, obviously we’re monitoring, we’re attentive to the increase in longer-term yields\nand—which have contributed to a tightening of broader financial conditions since the summer.\nAs I mentioned, persistent changes in broader financial conditions can have implications for the\npath of monetary policy. In this case, the tighter financial conditions we’re seeing—[coming]\nfrom higher long-term rates, but also from other sources, like the stronger dollar and lower\nequity prices—could matter for future rate decisions, as long as two conditions are satisfied.\nThe first is that the tighter conditions would need to be persistent. And that is something\nthat remains to be seen. But that’s critical. Things are fluctuating back and forth—that’s not\nwhat we’re looking for. With financial conditions, we’re looking for persistent changes that are\nmaterial.\nThe second thing is that, that the longer-term rates that have moved up—they can’t\nsimply be a reflection of, of expected policy moves from us that we would then—that if we\ndidn’t follow through on them, then the rates would come back down. So, and I would say on\nthat, it does not appear that an expectation of higher near-term policy rates is causing the\nincrease in longer-term rates. So, in the meantime, though, perhaps the most important thing is\nthat these higher Treasury yields are showing through to higher borrowing costs for households\nand businesses and those higher costs are going to weigh on economic activity to the extent this\ntightening persists and the mind’s eye goes to the 8 percent—near 8 percent mortgage rate,\nPage 5 of 27\nNovember 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nwhich could have pretty significant effect on housing. So that’s how I would answer your\nquestion.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Just as a quick follow-on, to be clear on this: In your opening\nstatement just now, you seemed to imply that you are not yet confident that financial conditions\nare restrictive enough to finish the fight. Is that true?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes. That’s exactly right. You know, to say it a different way: We\nhaven’t made any decisions about, about future meetings. We have not made a determination,\nand we’re not—I will say that we’re not confident at this time that we’ve reached such a stance.\nWe’re not confident that we haven’t; we’re not confident that we have. And that’s—that is—the\nway we’re going to be going into these future meetings is to be, you know, just determining the\nextent of any additional further policy tightening that may be appropriate to return inflation to\n2 percent over time.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jeanna.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you so much for taking our questions. I\nwonder, you know, if you don’t raise interest rates in December, would the presumption be at\nthat point that we should expect that rates are at their peak, or is there a possibility of restarting\nrate increases next year? And are there any costs to taking a more extended pause?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, let me start by saying we haven’t made a decision about\nSeptember. You’re asking a hypothetical there. But we’re going into December meeting—we’ll\nget, as you know, two more inflation ratings, two more labor market readings, some data on, on\neconomic activity, and so we’ll be taking—and also the broader situation, the broader financial\ncondition situation and broader world situation. We’ll be looking at all those things as we make\na decision in December. We haven’t made that decision.\nPage 6 of 27\nNovember 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nI would say, though, that, that the idea that if you—the idea that would—difficult to raise\nagain after stopping for a meeting or two, it’s just not right. I mean, the Committee will always\ndo what it thinks is appropriate at the time. And, again, we haven’t made any decisions about—\nat all about December. We didn’t even—we didn’t talk about making a decision in December\ntoday. Really, it was a decision for this meeting and understanding broader things.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nick.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, did the Fed\nstaff put a recession back into the baseline forecast in the materials for today’s meeting? And\nhow much does this tightening and financial conditions substitute for rate hikes if the tightening\nis persistent? You had said it was worth maybe a ¼ point when we had the bank failures in the\nspring. What is it here on something that’s presumably more straightforward and more familiar\nto simulate?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I guess I don’t want to answer your question about the—about the\nrecession. But the answer is “no.” I think I have to answer it, since we did publicly say in the\nminutes—you’ll know anyway in the [next] minutes—the staff did not put a recession back in. I\nmean, it would be hard to see how you would do that if you look at the—look at the activity\nwe’ve seen recently, which is not really indicative of a recession in the near term.\nIn terms of how to think about translation into rate hikes, I think it’s just too early to be\ndoing that, and the main reason is we just don’t know how persistent this will be. You can see\nhow volatile it is. Different kinds of news will affect the level of rates, and I think any kind of an\nestimate that was precise would hang out there and have a great chance of looking wrong very\nquickly. So I think what we can say is that financial conditions have clearly tightened, and you\ncan see that in the rates that, that consumers and households and businesses are paying now.\nPage 7 of 27\nNovember 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nAnd over time, that will have an effect. We just don’t know how persistent it’s going to be, and\nit’s tough to try to translate that in a way that I’d be comfortable communicating into how many\nrate hikes that is.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. I’d like to follow up and ask what makes you confident—what\nmakes you confident in the tighter financial conditions will slow above-trend growth when\n500 basis points of rate hikes, QT, and a minor banking crisis have not thus far?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, I just—that’s, you know, the way our policy works is—and\nsometimes it works with lags, of course, which can be long and variable, but ultimately, if you\nraise interest rates, you do see those effects. And you see those effects in the economy now.\nYou see what’s happening in the housing market. You’re seeing that now. You’ll see, if you\nlook at surveys of people, it’s not a good time they think to buy durable goods of various kinds\nbecause rates are so high now. I mention again, we’re getting reports from housing that the\neffects of this—of this could be quite significant. But you’re right. This has been a resilient\neconomy. And it’s, I think, been surprising in its resilience. And there are a number of possible\nreasons why that may be. Our job is to—is to achieve maximum employment and price stability,\nand so we take the economy as it comes. It has been resilient, so we just—we take it as it is.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Colby.\nCOLBY SMTH. Thank you. Colby Smith with the Financial Times. In terms of the\nthresholds that you’ve laid out of what could warrant further tightening, the additional evidence\nof persistently above-trend growth, or some kind of reversal in the recent easing of labor market\ntightness—that seems to suggest something more powerful than just one more ¼ point rate hike\nwould be necessary. And I’m just curious if that’s how the Committee sees it.\nPage 8 of 27\nNovember 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. So we’ve identified those factors. Those were not meant to be the\nonly factors or a specific test that we’re going to be applying with some metrics behind it.\nReally, we’re going to be looking at the broader picture. You know, what’s happening with our\nprogress toward the 2 percent inflation goal? Is the labor market continuing to, broadly, cool off\nand achieve a better balance? We’ll be looking at that. You know, growth—we look at growth\ninsofar as it has implications for our two mandate goals. We look at that, and we look at broader\nfinancial conditions. So we’ll be looking at all of those things as we reach a judgment, you\nknow, whether we need to further tighten policy. And, if we do reach that judgment, then we\nwill further tighten policy.\nCOLBY SMITH. Okay. And just in terms of the tightening of financial conditions, if\nthat is having some kind of offsetting effect in terms of the need to potentially again raise rates,\nwhat then is the potential impact on the trajectory of rate cuts? Could we see those maybe pulled\nforward or have to see more than what the September SEP indicated?\nCHAIR POWELL. So it’s, it’s—the fact is the Committee is not thinking about rate cuts\nright now at all. We’re not talking about rate cuts. We’re still very focused on the first question,\nwhich is, have we achieved a stance of monetary policy that’s sufficiently restrictive to bring\ninflation down to 2 percent over time sustainably? That is the question we’re focusing on. The\nnext question, as you know, will be, for how long will we remain restrictive? Will policy remain\nrestrictive? And what we’ve said there is that we’ll keep policy restrictive until we’re confident\nthat inflation is on a sustainable path down to 2 percent. That’ll be the next question, but\nhonestly, right now we’re really tightly focused on the first question. The question of rate cuts\njust doesn’t come up because I think the first—it’s so important to get that first question, you\nknow, as close to right as you can.\nPage 9 of 27\nNovember 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Mr. Chairman, I guess I had assumed that\nthere was a tightening bias in the Committee. You say in the statement you’re looking to assess\nthe appropriate stance of monetary policy, the extent to which you may need to hike additionally.\nYou didn’t say earlier that you were sufficiently restrictive. There were forecasts for two rate\nhikes among most members of the Committee. But then you just said that, you know, we\ndon’t—we haven’t made a determination. Would you say the bias right now is neutral, that there\nis no disposition to hike again and that the Committee largely has moved off of this forecast for\ntwo hikes? Sorry, one additional—\nCHAIR POWELL. No. I wouldn’t say that at all. I would say—I mean, the language,\nlooking at it here, “In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate\nto return inflation to 2 percent over time.” That’s the question we’re asking.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. So is it right to think of that as a hiking bias is still in the Committee\nhere?\nCHAIR POWELL. We haven’t used that term, but it’s fair to say that’s the question\nwe’re asking is, should we hike more? It’s not—it’s not, you know—that is the question, and\nyou’re right that, in September, we wrote down one additional rate hike. But, you know—and\nwe’ll [each] write down another forecast, as you know, in December.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Chris.\nCHRIS RUGABER. Thank you, Chris Rugaber, at Associated Press. Well, since the last\nmeeting, the auto workers’ strike has finished, oil prices have leveled off, and yet, on the other\nhand, you have the outbreak of war between Israel and Hamas. How do you see all those factors,\ntaken together, affecting the economy going forward? How are you thinking about those?\nPage 10 of 27\nNovember 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. So, there are significant issues out there, as you point out. Global\ngeopolitical tensions are certainly elevated. And that goes for the war in Ukraine; it goes for the\nwar between Israel and Hamas. We’re monitoring that. Our job is to monitor those things for\ntheir economic implications. So, the UAW strike, as you point out is—appears to be coming to\nan end. Oil prices have flattened out; they haven’t gone down. I guess they’ve gone down a\nlittle bit from their earlier peak. Another one is the possibility of government shutdown; we\ndon’t know about that one. So there’s plenty of risk out there. But I would go back to—the\nbigger picture from our standpoint is, we’ve got a very strong economy, strong labor market,\nmaking progress on the labor market, making progress on inflation. And we’re very focused on\ngetting confident that we have achieved a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently\nrestrictive. That’s really our focus.\nCHRIS RUGABER. Great. And just one quick thing: You, last month, had gone to\nYork, Pennsylvania, where you talked to a lot of—or, yeah, last month, where you talked to a lot\nof small business owners. Just curious, what sentiments did you hear from them or what did you\npick up on and what would you—was there anything that surprised you the most in terms of\nwhat they talked about?\nCHAIR POWELL. I wouldn’t say I was terribly surprised. I was very impressed by\nYork as a town with a real strategy. And I would say it’s very impressive what the people there\nhave put together in the face of, you know, some difficult longer-run trends about offshoring of\nmanufacturing and that kind of thing. They’ve done a great job as a city, I think. You know,\nwhat you hear—and it’s consistent there—which is people are really suffering under high\ninflation. You were there. We talked to some people who, you know, were feeling that in their\nbusinesses and other people who were feeling it in their home lives as well. You know, it’s\nPage 11 of 27\nNovember 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\npainful for people—particularly people who don’t have a lot of extra financial resources who are\nspending most of their incoming, you know, income on the essentials of life. So we know that.\nThat wasn’t new. But that did come through very clearly in, in the conversations we had in\nYork, and, you know, I walked away from that even—you know, I mean, just thinking that we\nreally—the best thing we can do for the U.S. is to restore price stability—fully restore price\nstability and not fail in that task and do it as quickly as possible, but also with the least damage\nwe can.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Rachel.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Hi Chair Powell. Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. Thanks\nfor taking our questions. You’ve spoken before about the pain that would likely be coming for\nthe economy in order to get inflation down. But since the economy has not responded to rate\nhikes in ways that would normally be expected, have you changed your views on that at all—on\nhow necessary or inevitable that kind of pain would be, say, for the labor market or overall\ngrowth?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, I think everyone has been very gratified to see that we’ve been\nable to achieve, you know, pretty significant progress on inflation without seeing the kind of\nincrease in unemployment that has been very typical of rate hiking cycles like this one. So\nthat’s, that’s a historically unusual and very welcome result. And the same is true of growth.\nYou know, we’ve been saying that we need to see below-potential growth. And growth has been\nstrong, but yet we’re still seeing this. I think I still believe, and my colleagues for the most part I\nthink still believe, that is likely to be true. It is still likely to be true—not a certainty—but likely\nthat we will need to see some slower growth and some softening in the labor market—in labor\nmarket conditions to get, you know, to fully restore price stability. So—but it’s only a good\nPage 12 of 27\nNovember 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthing that we haven’t seen it, and I think we know why. You know, since, since we lifted off,\nwe, we have understood that there are really two processes at work here. One of them—one of\nwhich is the unwinding of the distortions to both supply and demand [that arose] from the\npandemic and the response to the pandemic. And the other is, is, you know, restrictive monetary\npolicy, which is moderating demand and giving the supply side time to recover—time and space\nto recover. So you see those two forces now working together to bring down inflation. But it’s\nthat first one can bring down inflation without the need for higher unemployment or slower\ngrowth, it’s just—it’s supply—you know, supply-side improvements like shortages and\nbottlenecks and that kind of thing going away. It’s getting, you know, a significant increase in\nthe size of the labor market now, both from labor force participation and from immigration.\nThat’s a big supply-side, you know, gain that is really helping the economy, and it’s part of\nwhy—part of why GDP is so high is because we’re getting that supply. So, we welcome that.\nBut I think those things will run their course, and we’re probably still going to be left—we think,\nand I think—we’ll still be left with some ground to cover to get back to full price stability. And\nthat’s where monetary policy and what we do with demand is still going to be important.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Against that backdrop, if you’ve gotten any clarity on lags—if you\nhave an economy that’s been so resilient to high rate increases, does that suggest to you that\nthere isn’t necessarily this huge wave of tightening that's still coming through the pipeline and\nthat it may have already come into effect?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, I continue to think it’s very hard to say. So it’s been one\nyear at this meeting—one year ago, this was the fourth of our 75 basis points hikes. So that’s a\nfull year since then. I think we are seeing the effects of, of all the hiking we did last year and this\nyear—we’re seeing it. It’s very hard to know exactly what that might be. But you can, for\nPage 13 of 27\nNovember 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nexample—an example where you wouldn’t have felt this yet is, is debt that had been termed out.\nBut it’s going to come due and have to get rolled over next year or the year after. So—and there\nare little things like that where the effects have just taken time to get into the economy. So I\ndon’t—I think we have to make monetary policy under great uncertainty about how long the lags\nare. I think trying to make a clear—get a clear answer and say, “I’m just going to assume this is\nreally not a good way to do it.” And this is one of the reasons why we have slowed the process\ndown this year, was to give monetary policy time to get into the economy. And it takes time.\nWe know that, and you can’t rush it. So, doing—slowing down is giving us, I think, a better\nsense of, of how much more we need to do, if we need to do more.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Michael.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio. I’m\ntrying to connect the dots here. One quick clarification I wanted to ask about Rachel’s question\nis, you said you need slower growth. You had always said before a period of lower-than-trend\ngrowth. Has that changed? And, two, it sounds to me like you’re basically saying here that kind\nof the dot plot’s out the window, that every meeting is live with the possibility of a rate increase\nfor right now—doesn’t matter about the turn of the year—and that there’s not an objective way\nto determine whether or not you’ve got enough tightening in the system. It’s just going to be a\nsubjective judgment, meeting by meeting.\nCHAIR POWELL. Well so, let’s talk about the dot plot first. So the dot plot is a picture\nin time of what the people in the Committee think is likely to be appropriate monetary policy in\nlight of their own personal economic forecast. In principle, when things change, it’s not—that’s\nnot, like, planned that anybody’s agreed to or that we will do. That’s a forecast that would\nchange, for example—I mean, many things could change that would cause people to say, “I\nPage 14 of 27\nNovember 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nwouldn’t write down that dot six weeks later.” Think of the number of things that could change\nyour mind on that. So I think the efficacy of the dot plot probably decays over the three-month\nperiod between that meeting and the next meeting. But, nonetheless, it’s out there. We don’t—\nwe do personally update our forecast, but we don’t formally update the dot plot. So, you know, I\nthink we try to be as transparent as we can about the way we’re thinking about these things.\nWe’re laying out there our thinking, and, you know, as we approach the meeting, we’ll all be—\nmy colleagues and I will be talking about how we’re processing that data.\nIn terms of—so we’re not really changing the way—in terms of growth, what I said was\n“below potential.” So what you have here recently is growth that is—that is temporarily—\npotential growth is elevated for a year or two right now over its trend level. So the right way to\nthink about it is, what’s potential growth this year? People think trend growth over a long period\nof time is a little bit less than 2 percent, or I would say just around 2 percent. But what we’ve\nhad is, with the—with the, you know, improvement in the size of the labor force, as I mentioned,\nthrough both participation and immigration, and with the, the, you know, the better functioning\nin the labor market and with the—with the, you know, the unwinding of the supply chain and\nshortages and those kinds of things, you’re seeing actually elevated potential growth. There’s\ncatch-up growth that can happen in potential. And that means that if you’re growing—you could\nbe growing at 2 percent this year and still be growing below the increase in the potential output\nof the economy. I hope that’s clear. That’s really what’s going on. That’s why I would say it as\nbelow potential.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. But if you could clarify what I asked about the meeting by\nmeeting, are we essentially now supposed to assume that it’s a meeting by meeting, live meeting\nPage 15 of 27\nNovember 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nwith a chance of a rate increase that will be decided on subjective criteria rather than objective at\neach meeting?\nCHAIR POWELL. I mean, I don’t know that I want to just accept anybody’s\ncharacterization, but I’ll tell you how we’re doing this. So, we’re going meeting by meeting.\nWe’re asking ourselves whether we’ve achieved a stance of policy that is sufficiently restrictive\nto bring inflation down to 2 percent over time. That’s the question we’re asking. We’re looking\nat the full range of economic data, including financial conditions and all of those things that we\nlook at, and then we’re, we’re—you know, we’ve, we’ve come very far with this rate hiking\ncycle, very far. And you saw the spread at the September meeting of—you know, it’s a\nrelatively small spread of—people think one or two additional hikes. So you’re close to the—to\nthe end of the cycle. That’s—that was an impression as of, I believe, as of September. It’s not a\npromise or a plan of the future. And so we’re going into these meetings one by one. We’re\nlooking at the data. As I mentioned, we’re also—we’re being careful. We’re proceeding\ncarefully because we can proceed carefully at this time. Monetary policy is restrictive. We see\nits effects, particularly in interest-sensitive spending and other channels. So that’s how I think\nabout it.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Neil.\nNEIL IRWIN. Thanks. Hi, Chair Powell. Neil Irwin with Axios. In light of the run-up\nin long-term yields we’ve seen the last several weeks, have you given any consideration to the\npace of your asset runoff program? And if there were judgment that higher—that the higher-\nterm premium was endangering the dual-mandate goals, would that be reason to think about\nslowing or suspending QT or should we think of that as a more technical question around\nreserves?\nPage 16 of 27\nNovember 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. So the Committee is not considering changing the pace of balance\nsheet runoff. It’s not something we’re talking about or considering, and I know there are many\ncandidate explanations for why rates have been going up. And QT is certainly on that list. It\nmay be playing a relatively small effect, although I would say at $3.3 trillion in reserves, it’s\nnot—I think—I think it’s hard to make a case that reserves are even close to scarce at this point.\nSo that’s not something that we’re—that we’re looking at right now.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi. Victoria Guida with Politico. I wanted to ask about the Basel\nIII Endgame capital proposal. You’ve gotten a lot of “pushback” from people on different\naspects of the proposal, and you yourself expressed some reservations. And I’m just curious:\nCould you accept finalizing that proposal without significant changes?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, that proposal is out for comment. And we expect a lot of\ncomment. We won’t get those comments until the end of, well, into next year. You know,\nwe’ve extended the deadline. And we’ll take them seriously. We’ll read them. I’ll say what,\nwhat I do expect is that we will—we will come to a—we’re a consensus-driven organization.\nWe’ll come to a package that has broad support on the Board.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. So is broad support mean more support than the proposal had?\nCHAIR POWELL. It means broad support.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jonnelle.\nJONNELLE MARTE. Jonnelle Marte with Bloomberg. So, in addition to persistence,\nwhen you look at long-term Treasury yields, what else are you watching to evaluate how those\ntighter financial conditions are hitting the economy and if it will lessen the need for further\ntightening? Also, do you think that those higher yields could affect banking stress?\nPage 17 of 27\nNovember 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. So what do we look at? We look at a very wide range of financial\nconditions and, in fact, as you’ll know, different organizations publish different financial\nconditions’ indexes, which can have, you know, 7 or 8 variables, or they can have 100 variables,\nso there’s a very rich environment. And we tend to look at a few of them. I’m not going to give\nyou the names, but, you know, they’re a few of the common ones that people look at. And so\nthey’re looking at things like the level of the dollar, the level of equity prices, the level of rates,\nthe credit spreads. Sometimes they’re pulling in credit availability and things like that, so it isn’t\nany one thing. We would never look at, for example, long-term Treasury rates in isolation, nor\nwould we ignore them. But we would look at them as part of a broader picture, and they do play\na role, of course, in many of the major standard financial condition indexes. Your second\nquestion was?\nJONNELLE MARTE. On the banking stress.\nCHAIR POWELL. Banking stress—so it’s something we’re watching. As you know,\nwe, we did have—there were issues with interest rate risk and also funding uninsured deposits in\nthe March—the things we went through in March and thereafter. And so we’ve been working a\nlot with financial institutions to make sure that they have good funding plans and good—and that\nthey have a plan for how to deal with the kind of portfolio, unrealized, losses that they have.\nAnd we do think the banking system is quite resilient. We had, you know, a handful of bank\nfailures but—so that’s, that’s what we’re out there doing. And we don’t have any reason to think\nthat this—that these rate hikes are materially changing that picture, which is one of a strong\nbanking system and one where there’s a strong focus by banks and by supervisors on liquidity,\non funding, and those sorts of things.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Scott.\nPage 18 of 27\nNovember 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nSCOTT HORSLEY. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Scott Horsley from NPR. Last week you\nand your colleagues put forward a proposal to lower the cap on debit card swipe fees for\ncomment. Could you just talk a little bit about the considerations there—what it would mean for\nmerchants, for banks, for consumers, and also just what you all are seeing in terms of the use of\nboth debit and credit cards in the—in the payment system?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, so you’re right. We put a proposal out for comment, is\nwhat we did. And, you know, this is a job that Congress assigned us, as you, of course, know, in\nDodd-Frank, and all we can really do is faithfully implement the statute. That’s, that’s all we’re\ntrying to do. What else can we really do? It’s a 90-day comment period, and we typically don’t\ncomment on these things once they’re out for—out for comment. And we do hope that\nstakeholders—and we know that they will use this opportunity to express their views. They\nhaven’t been shy about that. So that’s, that’s critical and that’s, that’s what I can say about that\nnow.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Edward.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you. Thanks, Chair. Edward Lawrence with Fox\nBusiness. So for the last three months, the year-over-year PCE inflation was at 3.4 percent, core\nwell over 3 percent. You’ve said in the past, 2 percent remains the Federal Reserve target, but\nwith no rate increase today, how long would you be okay then with a 3 percent or 3 percent plus\noverall inflation?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, the, the progress is probably going to come in lumps and\nbe bumpy, but we’re making progress. You know, I think the core PCE [inflation rate] came\ndown by almost 60 basis points in the third quarter. So the best thing I could point you to would\nbe the September SEP where, you know, the expectation was that, that inflation by the end of\nPage 19 of 27\nNovember 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nnext year, on a 12-month trailing basis, would be well into the 2s and the year after that, further\ninto the 2s. So that’s, that’s—if you look historically, that’s, that’s sort of consistent with the\nway inflation comes down. It does take some time, and as you get—you know, as you get\nfurther and further from those highs, it may actually take longer time. But the good news is, you\nknow, we’re making progress and monetary policy is restrictive. And we feel like we’re on a\npath to make more progress, and it’s essential that we do.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. But you’ve said in the past that doing too little on interest\nrates could take years to fix, but the cost of doing too much could be easily fixed. How robust\nwas the debate about this pause on the doing-too-little side?\nCHAIR POWELL. That’s always the question we’re asking ourselves. And we know\nthat, if we fail to restore price stability, the risk is that expectations of higher inflation get\nentrenched in the economy, and we know that that’s really bad for people. Inflation will be both\nmore—both higher and more volatile. That’s a—that’s a prescription for misery, and, and so\nwe’re really committed to not letting that happen. You know, for the first year or so of our\ntightening cycle, the risk was all on the side of not doing enough. We’re, you know, we’re—\nwe’ve come far enough that, that the risks, you know, have gotten more two sided. You can’t\nidentify that with a lot of precision, but it does feel like the, the risks are more two sided now.\nAnd—but we’re committed to getting inflation back down to our target over time, and we will.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Simon.\nSIMON RABINOVITCH. Hi, Simon Rabinovitch with the Economist. Quick follow-up\nto the question about banking stresses—you talked about how the banking system is resilient. Of\ncourse, part of the resilience the past year stems from the Bank Term Funding Program that you\nlaunched in March. Given that bond prices have not recovered, that unrealized losses are\nPage 20 of 27\nNovember 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nprobably mounting, how likely is it that you might have to extend that program in March next\nyear?\nCHAIR POWELL. Good question. We haven’t really—we haven’t really been thinking\nabout that yet. We—you know, it’s November 1, and that’s a decision we’ll be making in the\nfirst quarter of next year.\nSIMON RABINOVITCH. Okay. Sorry. Quick second question about inflation\nexpectations—the U. Michigan sentiment survey showed a big jump in one-year-ahead inflation\nexpectations last month from 3.2 to 4.2. Last year you said that particular survey was a really\ndecisive factor in one of your rate hike decisions. If it stays elevated next time around, how big\nof an input will that be into your December thinking?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah. We look at a range of, of things. I think the, the, the, you\nknow, the UM thing got blown out of proportion a little bit. It was actually a preliminary\nestimate that got revised away. And I said it was preliminary in it, but that didn’t get picked up.\nSo we look at many, many things. So really, look across the broad array of surveys and also\nmarket-based estimates, and, you know, we do that really carefully at every meeting and between\nmeetings. And, you know, there’s—it’s just clear that inflation expectations are in a good place.\nThe public does believe that inflation will get back down to 2 percent over time,. And it will—\nthey’re right. So—and there’s no real crack in that—in that armor. You can always find one\nreading that is a little bit out of whack, but, honestly, the bulk of them are just very clear that the\npublic believes that inflation will come down. And that’s, of course—we believe that’s critical\nin winning the battle.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Megan.\nPage 21 of 27\nNovember 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMEGAN CASSELLA. Hi, Chair Powell. Megan Cassella with Barron’s. Thanks for\ntaking our questions. I wanted to see if you could talk about the neutral rate. You mentioned\ntoday that you’re still debating whether rates are sufficiently restrictive, and you’ve recently said\nthat evidence is suggesting policy is not too tight right now. So I was curious if you could\nelaborate on that at all and whether that means the neutral rate, in your view, has risen.\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah. So first thing to say is that it’s very important. It’s a very\nimportant variable in, in the way we think about monetary policy, but you can’t identify it with\nany precision in real time. And we know that. So you have to just take that—you have to take\nyour estimate of it with a grain of salt. What we know now is, you know, within a range of\nestimates of the neutral rate policy, is restrictive, and it’s therefore putting downward pressure on\neconomic activity, hiring, and inflation. So we do—we do talk about this. There’s not any\ndebate or attempt to, you know, to sort of agree as a group on what—whether r* has moved or\nnot. Some people think it has, some people haven’t said—that don’t think it has. Ultimately, it’s\nunknowable, and so really again, what we’re focused on is, you know, looking at the data and\ngiving ourselves a little more time now to look carefully at the data by being careful in our\nmoves. Does it—does it feel like monetary policy is restrictive enough to bring inflation down\nto 2 percent over time? That’s the question we’re asking ourselves. I think, you know, years\nfrom now economists will be revising their estimates of r* as it existed on November 1, 2023.\nYou can’t—we can’t really wait for that in making policy. We have to look—we have to have\nthose models and look at them and think about them, and, ultimately, we’ve got to look at the\neffects that policy is having, accounting for the lags, which makes it difficult.\nPage 22 of 27\nNovember 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMEGAN CASSELLA. If I could follow up on a wages point. Earlier you talked about\nthe inflation outlook, but I’m curious if you have any concerns whether wage inflation at its\ncurrent level could be—could risk pushing up overall inflation or re-acceleration?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, if you look at the—look at the broad range of wages, they have—\nwage increases have really come down significantly over the course of the last 18 months to a\nlevel where they’re substantially closer to that level that would be consistent with 2 percent\ninflation over time, making standard assumptions about productivity over time. So it’s much\ncloser than it was. And that’s true of the ECI, which is the one that’s—the one that we got this\nweek. It’s true of average hourly earnings and compensation per hour, too. So—and all of them\nare kind of saying that, which is great. And you have to look at a group of them because any one\nof them can be idiosyncratic from—in any given reading. So that’s what you see. And so what\nyou saw with the ECI reading was, if you look back a couple—it comes out four times a year—if\nyou look back a couple of quarters, you’ll see it was much higher, then it came down\nsubstantially in June. And then the September reading was more or less at the same level as the\nJune reading. So, in a way, it’s just validating that decline, and it was very close to our\nexpectations internally, too. So I think we feel good about that. Also I would say it isn’t—in my\nthinking, it’s not the case that, that wages have been the principal driver of inflation so far,\nalthough I think it’s all—I do think it’s fair to say that, as we go forward, as monetary policy\nbecomes more important relative to the supply-side issues I’ve talked about in the unwinding of\nthe pandemic effects, it may be that the labor market becomes more important over time, too.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nancy.\nPage 23 of 27\nNovember 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nNANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Hi. Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace. Chair\nPowell, are you now as concerned about overshooting and raising interest rates too much as you\nare about getting inflation down to the 2 percent target?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, as I mentioned, I think for much of the last year and a half, the\nconcern was not doing too, too—not doing enough. It was not getting rates high enough in time\nto avoid having inflation expectations—higher inflation expectations become entrenched. So\nthat was the concern. I think we’ve reached, you know, now more than 18 months into this.\nYou can see by the fact that we have slowed down, although we’re still—we’re still—we’re still\ntrying to gain confidence in what the appropriate stance is. But you can see that. We think, and\nI think, that the risks are getting more balanced. I’ll just say that they’re getting more balanced.\nThe risk of doing too much versus the risk of doing too little are getting—are getting more—\ncloser to balance, because policy is I think clearly restrictive at 5¼ to 5½ percent. That range, if\nyou take off a mainstream estimate of the expected inflation, take one year inflation, you’re\ngoing to see that. You’re going to see a real policy rate that is well above mainstream estimates\nof a neutral policy rate. Now that’s arithmetic. It doesn’t really—the proof is really in how the\neconomy reacts, but I would say that we’re in a place where those risks are getting closer to\nbeing in balance.\nNANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Okay. And you said the proof is how the economy\nreacts. What are you looking at to be sure you’re not overshooting?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, I think what we’re looking at is are we still—is inflation still\nbroadly cooling? Do we—is it sort of validating the path we saw over the summer, where\ninflation was clearly cooling and coming down. Now we’ve seen periods like that before, and\nthey’ve just—there hasn’t been follow-through. The data have bounced back. So what are we\nPage 24 of 27\nNovember 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nseeing? Are we seeing—is inflation still coming down? So that’s the first thing. The second\nthing is, in the labor market, what we’ve seen is a very positive rebalancing of supply and\ndemand, partly through just much more supply coming online. And with labor demand still\nclearly remaining very strong—when you have the kind of job growth we’ve had over the last\nquarter, it’s still very strong demand. So—and you see wage increases coming down as we\ndiscussed but coming down in a kind of gradual way. I think that’s—we want to see that, that\nwhole set of processes continue.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Bryan.\nBRYAN MENA. Bryan Mena, CNN. Do you think that there has been any structural\nchange in either consumption or in the job market that’s pushing at consumption? You\nobviously saw the third-quarter GDP figures, which were strong, and some economists expect\neveryone’s spending to have fizzled out by now. So I’m kind of wondering if there’s been any\nstructural change in consumption.\nCHAIR POWELL. I wouldn’t say there’s been a structural change in consumption. I\nwould say it’s certainly been strong. And so a couple of things. We may have underestimated\nthe balance sheet strength of households and small businesses, and that may be part of it. There\nmay be—you know, we’ve been, like everyone else, trying to estimate the number—the amount\nof savings that households have from the pandemic when they couldn’t spend on services really\nat all, or in-person services. And, you know, there can still be more of that than we think,\nalthough at a certain point we have to—we’re going to be getting back to pre-pandemic levels of\nsavings. We may not be there yet. So things are—clearly, people are still spending. The\ndynamic has been really strong job creation with now wages that are—that are higher than\ninflation, in the aggregate anyway, and that raises real disposable income, and that raises\nPage 25 of 27\nNovember 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nspending, which continues to drive more hiring. And so you’ve had a really—that whole—that\nwhole dynamic has been, and also at the same time, the pandemic effects are wearing off, so that\ngoods availability, automobile availability is better—or was better, I think it still is. And, from a\nbusiness standpoint, there are more people to hire. And it is more labor supply. So the whole\nthing has led to more growth, more spending, and that kind of thing. And it’s been—you know,\nit’s been good, and the thing is, we’ve been achieving progress on inflation in the middle of this.\nSo, it’s been a dynamic. The question is, how long can that continue? And, you know, I just\nthink this—the existence of this second set of factors at this time, which is the unwinding of the\npandemic effects, that’s what makes this cycle unique, I think, and, you know, we’re still\nlearning. That took longer for that process to begin than we thought, and we’re still learning\nabout how it plays out. That’s all we can do.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Daniel for the last question.\nDANIEL AVIS. Thank you, Chair Powell. I’m Daniel Avis from Agence France-Presse.\nJust a quick question following up on an earlier one with regards to the Israel–Hamas conflict.\nThe Fed’s Financial Stability Report said the Israel–Hamas conflict and the conflict in Ukraine\n“pose important risks to global economic activity, including the possibility of sustained\ndisruptions to regional trade and food, energy, and other commodities.” You’ve had\norganizations at the World Bank warning of a possible surge in oil prices if the war spreads to\nother countries in the region. I’m just wondering how the Fed is monitoring these developments\nin the Middle East—you mentioned they are—and just what the potential economic impact could\nbe if the conflict does spread to other countries in the region. Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. I wouldn’t want to speculate too much, but I’ll just say so—you\nknow, really the question there is, does the war spread more widely and does it start to do things\nPage 26 of 27\nNovember 1, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nlike affect oil prices in particular, since this is the Middle East we’re talking about. The price of\noil has really not reacted very much so far to this. As the—you know, as the Fed—as the Federal\nOpen Market Committee, our job is really to talk about [and] to understand the economy and\neconomic effects. And it isn’t clear, at this point, that the conflict in the Middle East is going\nto—is on track to have significant economic effects. That doesn’t mean it isn’t incredibly\nimportant and something for people to, you know, to take really important notice of, but it may\nor may not turn out to be something that matters for the Federal Open Market Committee as an\neconomic body. But—so what the Financial Stability Report does is it “calls out” risks. And\nthat’s what it’s doing—[it] is calling out a risk of that.\nAnd the war in Ukraine, the same. The war in Ukraine did have, immediately, very\nsignificant macroeconomic implications because of the connection to commodities.\nSo, thank you. Thanks very much.\nPage 27 of 27"

    "press_conf": "December 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nTranscript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference\nDecember 13, 2023\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on\nour dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.\nAs we approach the end of the year, it’s natural to look back on the progress that has been\nmade toward our dual-mandate objectives. Inflation has eased from its highs, and this has come\nwithout a significant increase in unemployment. That’s very good news. But inflation is still too\nhigh, ongoing progress in bringing it down is not assured, and the path forward is uncertain. As\nwe look ahead to next year, I want to assure the American people that we’re fully committed to\nreturning inflation to our 2 percent goal. Restoring price stability is essential to achieve a\nsustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.\nSince early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary\npolicy. We’ve raised our policy interest rate by 5¼ percentage points and have continued to\nreduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace. Our actions have moved our policy rate well into\nrestrictive territory, meaning that tight policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity\nand inflation, and the full effects of our tightening likely have not yet been felt.\nToday, we decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce\nour securities holdings. Given how far we have come, along with the uncertainties and risks that\nwe face, the Committee is proceeding carefully. We will make decisions about the extent of any\nadditional policy firming and how long policy will remain restrictive based on the totality of the\nincoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. I will have more to say about\nmonetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.\nRecent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity has slowed substantially from\nthe outsized pace seen in the third quarter. Even so, GDP is on track to expand around\nPage 1 of 24\nDecember 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\n2½ percent for the year as a whole, bolstered by strong consumer demand as well as improving\nsupply conditions. After picking somewhat over the—up somewhat over the summer, activity in\nthe housing sector has flattened out and remains well below the levels of a year ago, largely\nreflecting higher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates also appear to be weighing on business\nfixed investment. In our Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), Committee participants\nrevised up their assessments of GDP growth this year but expect growth to cool, with the median\nprojection falling to 1.4 percent next year.\nThe labor market remains tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into\nbetter balance. Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 204,000 jobs per month, a\nstrong pace that is nevertheless below that seen earlier in the year. The unemployment rate\nremains low at 3.7 percent. Strong job creation has been accompanied by an increase in the\nsupply of workers. The labor force participation rate has moved up since last year, particularly\nfor individuals aged 25 to 54 years, and immigration has returned to pre-pandemic levels.\nNominal wage growth appears to be easing, and job vacancies have declined. Although\nthe jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available\nworkers. FOMC participants expect the rebalancing in the labor market to continue, easing\nupward pressures on inflation. The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP rises\nsomewhat from 3.8 percent at the end of this year to 4.1 percent at the end of next year.\nInflation has eased over the past year but remains above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.\nBased on the consumer price index and other data, we estimate that total PCE prices rose\n2.6 percent over the 12 months ending in November and that, excluding the volatile food and\nenergy categories, core PCE prices rose 3.1 percent.\nPage 2 of 24\nDecember 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nThe lower inflation readings over the past several months are welcome, but we will need\nto see further evidence to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our\ngoal.\nLonger-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a\nbroad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from\nfinancial markets. As is evident from the SEP, we anticipate that the process of getting inflation\nall the way to 2 percent will take some time. The median projection in the SEP is 2.8 percent\nthis year, falls to 2.4 percent next year, and reaches 2 percent in 2026.\nThe Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware\nthat high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for\nthose least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We\nare highly, highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and\nwe are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.\nAs I noted earlier, since early last year, we have raised our policy rate by 5¼ percentage\npoints, and we have decreased our securities holdings by more than $1 trillion. Our restrictive\nstance of monetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation. The\nCommittee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at\n5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings.\nWhile we believe that our policy rate is likely at or near its peak for this tightening cycle,\nthe economy has surprised forecasters in many ways since the pandemic, and ongoing\nprogress—sorry—ongoing progress toward our 2 percent inflation objective is not assured. We\nare prepared to tighten policy further if appropriate. We’re committed to achieving a stance of\nPage 3 of 24\nDecember 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nmonetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation sustainably down to 2 percent\nover time and to keeping policy restrictive until we’re confident that inflation is on a path to that\nobjective.\nIn our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an\nappropriate path for the federal funds rate based on what each participant judges to be the most\nlikely scenario going forward. While participants do not view it as likely to be appropriate to\nraise interest rates further, neither do they want to take the possibility off the table. If the\neconomy evolves as projected, the median participant projects that the appropriate level of the\nfederal funds rate will be 4.6 percent at the end of 2024, 3.6 percent at the end of 2025, and\n2.9 percent at the end of 2026, still above the median longer-term rate.\nThese projections are not a Committee decision or plan; if the economy does not evolve\nas projected, the path of policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our maximum-employment\nand price-stability goals.\nIn light of the uncertainties and risks, and how far we have come, the Committee is\nproceeding carefully. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the\ntotality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and\ninflation, as well as the balance of risks. In determining the extent of any additional policy\nfirming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will\ntake into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary\npolicy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. We\nremain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keeping longer-\nterm inflation expectations well anchored. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage\nfor achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.\nPage 4 of 24\nDecember 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nTo conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and\nbusinesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the\nFed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.\nThank you. I look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Chris Rugaber.\nCHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Thank you. Chris Rugaber at Associated Press. I wanted\nto ask, how should we interpret the addition of the word “any” before “additional . . . firming” in\nthe statement? I mean, does that mean that you’re pretty much done with rate hikes and the\nCommittee has shifted away from a tightening bias and toward a more neutral stance?\nThank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So—specifically on “any”: We do say that “in determining the\nextent of any additional policy firming that may be appropriate,” so “any additional policy\nfirming”—that sentence. So we added the word “any” as an acknowledgement that we believe\nthat we are likely at or near the, the peak rate for this cycle. Participants didn’t write down\nadditional hikes that we believe are likely, so that’s what we wrote down. But participants also\ndidn’t want to take the possibility of further hikes off the table. So that’s really what we were\nthinking.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Happy holidays, Mr. Chairman. Fed\nGovernor Chris Waller said that if inflation continues to fall, then the Fed in the next several\nmonths could be cutting interest rates. I wonder if you could comment on whether you agree\nwith Fed Governor Waller on that, that the Fed would become more restrictive if it didn’t cut\nrates if inflation fell. Thank you, sir.\nPage 5 of 24\nDecember 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. So, of course, I don’t comment on, on any other officials, even those\nwho work at the Fed. But I’ll—but I’ll try to answer your question more broadly. So the way—\nthe way we’re looking at it is, is really this. When we started out, right, we said the first question\nis, how fast to move, and we moved very fast. The second question is, you know, really, how\nhigh to raise the policy rate? And that’s really the question that we’re still on here. We’re, we’re\nvery focused on that, as I—as I mentioned. People generally think that we’re at or near that and,\nand think it’s not likely that we will hike, although they don’t take that possibility off the table.\nSo that’s—when you get to that question, and that’s your answer, there’s a natural—naturally, it\nbegins to be the next question, which is when it will become appropriate to begin dialing back\nthe amount of policy restraint that’s in place.\nSo that’s really the next question, and that’s what people are thinking about and, and\ntalking about. And I would just say this. We are seeing, you know, strong growth that is—that\nappears to be moderating; we’re seeing a labor market that is coming back into balance by so\nmany measures; and we’re seeing inflation making real progress. These are the things we’ve\nbeen wanting to see. We can’t know. We still have a ways to go. No one is declaring victory.\nThat would be premature. And we can’t be guaranteed of this progress [continuing]. So we’re,\nwe’re moving carefully in making that assessment of whether we need to do more or not. And\nthat’s, that’s really the question that we’re on. But, of course, the other question, the question of\nwhen will it become appropriate to begin dialing back the amount of policy restraint in place,\nthat, that begins to come into view and is clearly a discussion—topic of discussion out in the\nworld and also a discussion for us at our meeting today.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Can you give some color as to the nature of that discussion today?\nThank you.\nPage 6 of 24\nDecember 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So it, it comes up in this way today. Everybody wrote down\nan SEP forecast. So many people mentioned what their—what their rate forecast was. And there\nwas no back-and-forth, no attempt to sort of reach agreement like, “This is what I wrote down;\nthis is what I think,” that kind of thing, and a preliminary kind of a discussion like that. Not\neverybody did that, but many people did. And then, and I would say, there’s a general\nexpectation that this will be—this will be a topic for us, looking ahead. That, that’s really what\nhappened in today’s meeting. I can’t do the head count for you in real time. But that’s generally\nwhat happened today.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Rachel.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Hi, Chair Powell. Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. Thanks\nfor taking our questions. At this point, can you confidently say that the economy has avoided a\nrecession and isn’t heading for one now? And if the answer is “no,” I’m curious about what\nyou’d still be looking for. Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. I think you can say that there’s little basis for thinking that the\neconomy is in a recession now. I would say that.\nI think there’s, there’s always a probability that, that there will be a recession in the next\nyear, and it’s a meaningful probability no matter what the economy is doing. So it’s always a\nreal possibility. The question is, is it—so it’s a possibility here. I have always felt, since the\nbeginning, that there was a possibility, because of the unusual situation, that the economy could\ncool off in a way that enabled inflation to come down without the kind of large job losses that\nhave often been associated with high inflation and tightening cycles. So far, that’s what we’re\nseeing. That’s what many forecasters, on and off the Committee, are seeing. This result is not\nPage 7 of 24\nDecember 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nguaranteed. It is—it is far too early to declare victory. And there are certainly risks. It’s\ncertainly possible that, that the economy will behave in an unexpected way. It has done that\nrepeatedly through the post—in the post-pandemic period. Nonetheless, where we are is, is we\nsee the things that I—that I mentioned.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. I’m curious, if you’re looking back on the past year, you talked\nabout “navigating by the stars under cloudy skies.” Can you talk about some of the ways in\nwhich the economy surprised you most this year, where you thought it would behave in one way\nand had to pivot to respond? Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think forecasters generally, if you go back a year, were very\nbroadly forecasting a recession for this year, for 2023. And not only did that not happen—that\nincludes Fed forecasters and really, essentially, all forecasters; a very high proportion of\nforecasters predicted very weak growth or a recession—not only did that not happen, we actually\nhad a very strong year, and that was a combination of, of strong demand but also of real gains on\nthe supply side.\nSo this was the year when labor force participation picked up, where immigration picked\nup, where the distortions to supply and demand from the pandemic—you know, the shortages\nand the bottlenecks—really began to unwind. So we had significant supply-side gains with\nstrong demand, and we got what looks like a 2½ percent-plus, or a little more than that, growth\nyear at a time when potential growth this year might even have been higher than that, just\nbecause of the healing on the supply side. So that was a surprise to just about everybody.\nI think the inflation forecast is roughly, roughly what people wrote down a year ago, but\nin a very different setting. And I would say the labor market, because of the stronger growth, has\nalso been significantly better. If you look back at the SEP from a year ago, there was a\nPage 8 of 24\nDecember 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nsignificant increase in, in unemployment. It didn’t really happen. We’re still at 3.7 percent. So\nwe’ve seen, you know, strong growth, still a tight labor market but one that’s coming back into\nbalance with the—with support from the supply side, a greater supply of labor. It’s a—you\nknow, that’s, that’s what we see, and I think that combination was, was not anticipated broadly.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Howard.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thanks. Howard Schneider with Reuters, and thanks for\ntaking the questions. I, I wonder if you could give a little more color or detail on what—on what\nmotivates the lower rates next year, whether it’s a coincidence, for example, that the spread\nbetween PCE inflation, core inflation, and the federal funds rate stays constant over the year.\nAre you simply calibrating against the fall in prices, in the price level that you’re expecting, in\nthe rate of inflation that you’re expecting as opposed to supporting the economy?\nCHAIR POWELL. Nothing quite that mechanical is happening. The SEP really is, is a\nbottoms-up—built from the bottom up, right? So I think people are looking at what’s happening\nin the economy. And I think if you look at the big difference from September in the SEP, [it is\nthat] the expectations for inflation this year, both headline and core, have come down, you know,\nreally significantly in three months. That’s a big piece of, of this. At the same time, [real GDP]\ngrowth has turned out to be very strong in the third quarter. [Now it] is slowing, we believe, as,\nas appropriate. And we’ve got—we’ve had several labor market reports, which suggest, again,\nsignificant progress toward greater balance across a very—a broad range of indicators. You’re\nseeing so many of the indicators coming back to normal, not all of them. But so I think that\npeople look at that, and they write down their—basically, each individual writes down a forecast\nand a rate forecast that goes with that forecast. We tabulate them and, and publish it. And so it’s\nnot—it isn’t—you ask about real rates, I take it?\nPage 9 of 24\nDecember 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Yes.\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, that’s—that is—that is something that we’re very\nconscious of, and aware of, and monitor, and it’s certainly a big part of—it’s a part of how we\nthink about things. But, really, it’s broader financial conditions that matter. And, as you well\nknow, it’s so hard to know exactly, you know, what the—what the real rate is or exactly how\ntight policy is at any given time. So you couldn’t follow that like it was a rule and think that you\nwould get the right answer all the time, but it’s certainly something that we’re focused on. And,\nindeed, if you look at the projections, I think the expectation would be that the real rate is\ndeclining as we—as we move forward.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. It sounds like the discussion—if I could follow up—has, has\nalready kind of begun. I’m wondering, just related to, to Steve’s question, how the—how the\ntactics of this play out given the slowing of inflation and the fact that the deeper you get into\n2024, the closer you get to a presidential election. Do you want to front-load this, in other\nwords?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah. No, we—we’re—we don’t think about political events. We\ndon’t think about politics. We think about what’s the right thing to do for the economy. The\nminute we start thinking about those things—you know, we just can’t do that. We have to think,\nwhat’s the right thing? We’ll do the things that we think are right for the economy at the time\nwe—when we think is the right time. That’s what we’ll always do.\nSo I mentioned we’re moving carefully. One of the things we’re moving carefully about\nis that decision over—that assessment, really—over whether, whether we’ve done enough,\nreally. And you see that people are not writing down rate hikes. That’s, that’s us thinking that\nwe have done enough but not, not feeling that really strongly, confidently and not wanting to\nPage 10 of 24\nDecember 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ntake the possibility of a rate hike off the table. Nonetheless, it’s not the base case anymore,\nobviously, as it was, you know, 60, 90 days ago. So that’s, that’s how we’re—that’s how we’re\napproaching things. And, and, you know, as I mentioned, we wrote down this SEP, and it talks\nabout—people have individual assessments of when it will be appropriate to, you know, to start\nto dial back on, on the tight policy we have in place, and that’s a discussion we’ll be having\ngoing forward. But that’s another assessment that we’re going to make very carefully, so as time\ngoes forward.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nick.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, you’ve\nargued over the last year that policy tightening started before you actually lifted off because the\nmarket anticipated your moves and tightened on your behalf. The market is now easing policy\non your behalf by anticipating a funds rate by next September that’s a full point below the\ncurrent level, with cuts beginning around March. Is this something that you are broadly\ncomfortable with?\nCHAIR POWELL. So this last year has been remarkable for the, the sort of seesaw\nthing, the back-and-forth we’ve had over the course of the year of markets moving away and\nmoving back and that kind of thing. So, and what I would just say is that we, we focus on what\nwe have to do and how we need to use our tools to achieve our goals, and that’s what we really\nfocus on. And people are going to have different forecasts about the economy, and they’re going\nto—those are going to show up in market conditions, or they won’t, you know. But in any case,\nwe have to do what we think is right.\nAnd, you know, in the long run, it’s important that financial conditions become aligned\nor are aligned with what we’re trying to accomplish, and, in the long run, they will be, of course,\nPage 11 of 24\nDecember 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nbecause we will do what it takes to get to our goals. And, ultimately, that will mean that\nfinancial conditions will, will come along. But in the meantime, there can be back-and-forth,\nand, you know, I’m just focused on what’s the right thing for us to do. And my colleagues are\nfocused on that, too.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. The markets seem to think inflation is coming down credibly. Do\nyou believe we’re at the point where inflation is coming down credibly?\nCHAIR POWELL. Listen, I welcome the progress. I think it’s, it’s really good to see the\nprogress that we’re making. I think if you look at the 12-month—look at the 6-month measures,\nyou see very low numbers. If you look at 12-month measures, you’re still well above 2 percent.\nYou’re actually above 3 percent on core, through November, PCE [inflation]. That isn’t to say—\nI’m not, you know, calling into question the progress. It’s great. We just need to see more. We\nneed to see, you know, continued further, further progress toward getting back to 2 percent.\nThat’s, that’s what we need to see.\nSo, you know, our—it’s our job to restore price stability. And that—it’s one of our two\njobs, along with maximum employment, and they’re equal. So we’re very focused on, on, you\nknow, doing that. As I mentioned, we’re moving carefully at this point. We’re pleased with the\nprogress, but, but we see the need for further progress, and I think—I think it’s fair to say there is\na lot of uncertainty about going forward. We’ve seen the economy move in surprising\ndirections, so we’re just going to need to see more further progress.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jeanna.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Jeanna Smialek, New York Times. Thanks for taking our\nquestions. In the SEP from today, [real GDP] growth is notably below potential in 2024. If\ngrowth were to surprise us again in the way that it has for years now by being stronger than\nPage 12 of 24\nDecember 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nexpected next year, would it still be possible to cut rates? Or, put another way, is below-trend\ngrowth necessary to cut rates, or would continued progress on inflation alone be sufficient?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we’ll, we’ll look at the totality of the data. Growth is one thing,\nso is inflation, so is labor market data. So we’d, we’d look at the totality. As we—as we make\ndecisions about policy changes going forward, we’re going to be looking at all those things and,\nparticularly, about the—as they affect the outlook. So it’s ultimately all about the outlook and\nthe balance of risks as well. So that’s what—that’s what we’d be looking for.\nIf we have stronger growth, you know, that’ll be good for people. That’ll be good for the\nlabor market. It might actually mean that it takes a little longer to get inflation down to\n2 percent. We will get it down to 2 percent, but, you know, if we see stronger growth, we’ll—we\nwill set policy according to what we actually see. And, and so that’s how I would answer.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. I guess the—I guess the question I’m asking, if you don’t mind a\nquick follow-up, I guess the question I’m asking is, is above-trend growth itself a problem?\nCHAIR POWELL. It’s only a problem inso—it’s not itself a problem. It’s only a\nproblem insofar as it makes it more difficult for us to achieve our goals. And, you know, if you\nhave—if you have growth that’s robust, what that will mean is probably it will keep the labor\nmarket very strong. It probably will, will place some upward pressure on inflation. That could\nmean that it takes longer to get to 2 percent inflation. That could mean we need to keep rates\nhigher for longer. It could even mean, ultimately, that we would need to hike again. It just is—\nit’s the way, the way our policy works.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Neil.\nNEIL IRWIN. Hi, Chair Powell. Neil Irwin with Axios. How do you interpret the state\nof the labor market right now? And, in particular, you’ve referred even today to evidence that\nPage 13 of 24\nDecember 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nit’s coming into better balance. What would you need to see to conclude that it has reached that\nbalance?\nCHAIR POWELL. So on, on the better-balance side, there are just a lot of things. It’s—\nyou see—you see job growth still strong but moving back down to more sustainable levels, given\npopulation growth and labor force participation. The things that are not quite—but let me go on\nwith that list. You know, claims are low. If you look at surveys of businesses, they’re, they’re—\nsort of the era of this frantic labor shortage, [those kinds of worker shortages] are behind us, and\nthey’re seeing a shortage of labor as being significantly alleviated. If you look at shortages of\nworkers, whereas they thought job, job availability was the highest that it’d ever been or close to\nit, that’s now down to more normal levels by so many measures—participation,\nunemployment—so many measures: the unemployment—job openings, quits, all of those\nthings.\nSo wages are still running a bit above what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation\nover a long period of time. They’ve been gradually cooling off. But if wages are running around\n4 percent, that’s still a bit above, I would say. And I guess there, there are just a couple of\nother—the unemployment rate is very, very low. And these are—but, but I would just say,\noverall, the development of the labor market has been very positive. It’s been a good time for\nworkers to find jobs and get solid wage increases.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Claire.\nCLAIRE JONES. Claire Jones, Financial Times. You know, I’d say the mood among\neconomists at the moment seems to be one of cautious optimism, which is somewhat\ncorroborated by your forecast by the sense that we are going to have a soft landing. Yet when\nPage 14 of 24\nDecember 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nwe—when we hear from the general public, there’s a lot of discord about economic conditions.\nWhat do you think explains this disconnect, and does it matter for policymakers?\nCHAIR POWELL. It may be. A common theme is that, while inflation is coming down,\nand that’s very good news, the price level is not coming down. Prices of some, some goods and\nservices are coming down. But overall, in the aggregate, the price level is not. So people are\nstill living with high prices, and that’s, that’s not—that is something that people don’t like. And,\nyou know, so what will happen with that is, wages are now—[changes in] real wages are now\npositive. So [nominal] wages are now moving up more than inflation, as inflation comes down.\nAnd so that might help improve the mood of people.\nBut we do see those—we see those public opinion surveys. The thing that we can do is\nto do our jobs, which is to use our tools to foster price stability, which has such great benefits\nover such long periods of time, and which is the thing that really enables us to work for and\nachieve an extended period of high employment, which is so beneficial for, you know, families\nand, and companies around the country.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi. Victoria Guida with Politico. I wanted to ask, you know, on,\non the flip side of if things start to deteriorate rapidly, if we do fall into a recession, if we do start\nto see unemployment rise, at sort of the levels of inflation that we’re seeing now, how would you\nall think about that in terms of rate cuts? Would that be a sign that you’ve, you’ve done your job\ndemand-wise?\nCHAIR POWELL. Sorry—if?\nVICTORIA GUIDA. If, if the economy starts to—looks like it’s starting to fall into a\nrecession; if, if the jobless rate starts to rise.\nPage 15 of 24\nDecember 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. That’s not something we’re hoping to see. Obviously, we’re hoping\nto, to see something very different—which is a continuation of what we have seen, which is the\nlabor market coming into better balance without a significant increase in unemployment,\ninflation coming down without a significant increase in unemployment, and growth moderating\nwithout a significant increase in unemployment. That’s what we’re, we’re trying very much to\nachieve and not something that we’re looking to see.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. But, but would you take that as a signal that you should cut rates?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, obviously, what we’ll do is we’ll look at the totality of\nthe data, as I’ve mentioned a couple times, and, certainly, the labor data would be important in\nthat. And, you know, if you—if you can describe a situation like that where if, if there were the\nbeginning of a recession or something like that, then, yes, that would certainly weigh heavily on\nthat decision.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Michael McKee.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio. Mr.\nChairman, you were, by your own admission, behind the curve in starting to raise rates to fight\ninflation, and you said earlier, again, “the full effects of our tightening (cycle) have not yet been\nfelt.” How will you decide when to cut rates, and how will you ensure you’re not behind the\ncurve there?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we’re, we’re aware of the risk that we would hang on too long.\nYou know, we know that that’s a risk, and we’re very focused on not making that mistake. And\nwe do regard the two—you know, we’ve come back into a better balance between the risk of\noverdoing it and the risk of underdoing it. Not only that, we were able to focus hard on the—on\nthe price-stability mandate. And we’re getting back to the point where—which is what you do\nPage 16 of 24\nDecember 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nwhen you’re very far from, from one of them, one of the two mandates—you’re getting now\nback to the point where both mandates are important, and they’re, they’re more in balance, too.\nSo I think we’ll be—we’ll be very much keeping that in mind, as we make policy going forward.\nAnd the things we’ll be looking at, I’ve already described. You know, we’re, we’re\nobviously looking hard at what’s happening with demand, and what we see? We see the same\nthing other people see, which is a strong economy, which really put up quite a performance in\n2023. We see good evidence and good reason to believe that growth will come in lower next\nyear. And you see what the forecasts are. I think the median growth—median participant wrote\ndown 1.4 percent growth, but, you know, we’ll have to see. It’s very hard to predict. We’ll also\nbe looking to see progress on inflation and, you know, the labor market remaining strong but, but\nideally, without seeing the kind of large increase in unemployment that happens sometimes.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. If I could follow up: When you begin the cutting cycle, will it be\nessentially run the same way you do it now with raising rates, where you basically do trial and\nerror, cut and see what happens, or will you tie it to some particular measure of progress?\nCHAIR POWELL. We haven’t typically tried to articulate, with one exception, really\nspecific target levels, which was if you—some of you will remember the thresholds that we used\nin, I guess, 2013. I don’t—the answer is, these are things that we haven’t, you know, really\nworked out yet. We’re sort of just at the beginning of, of that discussion.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Edward.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Edward Lawrence of Fox\nBusiness. So if the Fed cuts rates as the dot plot is, is showing, about 75 basis points, does that\nsignal that there’s a belief of weakness next year in the economy?\nPage 17 of 24\nDecember 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. It wouldn’t, if that were to—first of all, let me just say, that isn’t a\nplan. That’s, that’s just cumulating what people wrote down. So that’s not something—you\nknow this, but allow me to say it again: We don’t debate or discuss what the right, you know,\nwhose SEP is right. We just say what they are, and we tabulate them and publish them. So and\nit’s, you know, it’s important for people to know that. But it wouldn’t need to be a sign of—it\ncould just be a sign that the economy is normalizing, and it doesn’t need the tight policy. It\ndepends on—the economy can evolve in many different ways, right? So but, but it could be\nmore of what I just described.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. And you focused on core inflation, we’ve heard from—in\nother meetings. How sticky is core inflation right now?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, that’s what we’re finding out, and we’ve, you know, we’ve\nseen real progress in, in core inflation. It has been sticky, and famously, the service sector is\nthought to be stickier, but we’ve actually seen reasonable progress in nonhousing services, which\nwas the area where, where you would expect to see less progress. We are seeing some progress\nthere, though. And, in fact, all three of the categories of core [prices] are now contributing:\ngoods, housing services, nonhousing services. They’re all contributing in different—at different\nlevels, you know, meeting by meeting—or, rather, report by report. So, yeah.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Okay. Let’s go to Catarina.\nCATARINA SARAIVA. Catarina Saraiva of Bloomberg News. Thanks for taking our\nquestions. I just wanted to ask a little bit about, you know, we had some pretty positive data this,\nyou know, this morning and yesterday. I’m assuming those were not incorporated into the\nforecast we see today, but I just wanted to ask, you know, how that kind of adds to your thinking,\nyou know, on the inflation outlook.\nPage 18 of 24\nDecember 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. Right. So we got—we got CPI the morning of the first day, and we\ngot PPI the next day, which informs the, you know, the translation into PCE [inflation]. So it’s\nvery late in the game, you know, to—but nonetheless, participants are allowed to, encouraged to\nupdate their SEP forecast until probably midmorning today. After that, so staff has to—has to\ncumulate all of that and create the documents that you see. So until about midmorning, a little,\nmaybe late morning, it’s okay to update, and I believe some people did update their forecast\nbased on what we saw today.\nCATARINA SARAIVA. Okay. And do you see—I mean, how are you, when you think\nabout, you know, starting to think about the rate cuts next year or whenever they come, how do\nyou, you know, how do you think about the economy we’re in now kind of post-pandemic? Do\nyou think that there’s been significant structural shifts, and is that going to change how you look\nat a rate cut path?\nCHAIR POWELL. The question of whether there have been fundamental structural\nshifts is, is really hard to know the answer and a very interesting one right now. The one that\nwould affect—the one that comes to mind, though, is just the question of where the neutral rate\nof interest is. And so, for example, if it’s risen, and I’m not saying that it has, but if it were to\nhave risen, that would mean that, that interest rates would need to be a little bit higher to convey\nthe same level of restriction. The thing is, we’re not really going to know that. You know,\npeople will be writing papers about that 10 years from now and still fighting about it. So it’s just\nthat it’s going to be uncertain.\nSo we’re going to be making policy in this, you know, difficult, uncertain, really\nunprecedented environment. Some—someone once said that you know the—you know the\nnatural rate of interest by its works, and that’s really right, but that’s very difficult because policy\nPage 19 of 24\nDecember 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\noperates with a lag. So that’s one of the reasons why we slowed down this year. We started\nslowing down at this meeting last year, reducing the pace at which we were adding restriction.\nAnd, over the course of this year, we really slowed down a lot to give those lags time to work.\nIn terms of demand, has demand shifted more away from services into goods? There’s—\nyou can make a case for that, that the shift back into services has not been complete, and it\ndoesn’t look like it’s ongoing, but I don’t know if that’s right. Maybe people just bought so\nmuch stuff that they temporarily don’t want any more stuff. They haven’t got anyplace to put it.\n[Laughter]\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Jennifer.\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. Thank you, Chair Powell. Jennifer Schonberger with\nYahoo Finance. You said back in July that you needed to start cutting rates before getting to\n2 percent inflation. As you mentioned, PCE inflation is now running at 3½ on core. On a six-\nmonth annual basis, core PCE is running at 2½ percent, though when you look at supercore and\nshelter, they are, of course, stickier. So when looking in the different components of the data,\nhow much closer do you have to get to 2 percent before you consider cutting rates?\nCHAIR POWELL. I mean, the reason you wouldn’t wait to get to 2 percent to cut rates\nis that policy would be, it would be too late. I mean, you’d want to be reducing restriction on the\neconomy well before 2 percent because—or before you get to 2 percent so you don’t overshoot,\nif we think, think of restrictive policy as weighing on economic activity. You know, it takes—it\ntakes a while for policy to get into the economy, affect economic activity, and affect inflation.\nSo I can’t give you a precise answer. But if you look at what’s in the—in the SEP, and, you\nknow, I think you’ll see a reasonable estimate of the time lags and things like that that it would\ntake.\nPage 20 of 24\nDecember 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. Do think below 3 percent would be reasonable?\nCHAIR POWELL. I wouldn’t want to—I wouldn’t want to identify any one precise\npoint, because I would be able to look back then and probably find out that it turned out not to be\nright. But we’ll be looking at it and, and looking at the broad collection of factors.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Jean Yung.\nJEAN YUNG. Hi, Chair Powell. Jean Yung with Market News. I wanted to go back to\nthe stickiness-of-inflation question. Over the past couple of years, a lot of central bankers have\ntalked about the more difficult last mile of getting inflation back down to 2 percent, yet it’s also\nbeen surprising how fast inflation has come down this year. I’m curious, do you think something\nhas changed in our understanding of inflation, or do you subscribe to this notion still? Or is it\nsomething different about the U.S. economy? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. I think—I think this. You know, we felt since the beginning that it\nwould be a combination of two factors. The first factor is just the unwinding of, of what\nhappened in the pandemic: the distortions of supply and demand. And the second thing would\nbe our policy, which was weighing on aggregate demand and actually making it easier for the\nsupply side to recover because of lower demand. We thought those two things were going to be\nnecessary. Sorry, say your—say the last part of your question again.\nJEAN YUNG. If there was something different about the U.S. economy.\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah. So it’s not that—it may or may not be about “different,” the\nU.S. economy being different. I think that this inflation was not the classic demand overload,\npot-boiling-over, kind of inflation that we [typically] think about. It was a combination of very\nstrong demand, without question, and unusual supply-side restrictions, both on the goods side but\nPage 21 of 24\nDecember 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nalso on the labor side, because we had a—we had a participation shock. So this is just very\nunusual.\nAnd, you know, we had the view—my colleagues and I broadly had the view—that we\ncould get a lot of—you know, you had essentially a vertical supply curve, because you ran into\nthe limits of, of capacity at very low levels, because there weren’t workers and because people\ncouldn’t—the supply chains were all broken. So we, we had the view that you could come\nstraight down that vertical supply curve to the extent demand [was] lowered, reduced. And, you\nknow, something like that has happened. It happened so far. The question is, you know, once,\nonce that part of it runs out—and we think it has a ways to run; we definitely think that the sort\nof supply chain and shortages side has some, some ways to run—does labor force participation\nhave much more to run? It might. Immigration could help, but it may be that, at some point—at\nsome point, you will run out of supply-side help, and then it gets down to demand, and it gets\nharder. That’s, that’s very possible. But to say with certainty that the last mile is going to be\ndifferent, I’d be reluctant to, you know, to suggest that we have any certainty around that. We\njust don’t know. I mean, inflation keeps coming down. The labor market keeps getting back\ninto balance. And it’s so far, so good—although we kind of assume that it will get harder from\nhere. But so far, it hasn’t.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Okay. We’ll go to Megan for the last question.\nMEGAN CASSELLA. Hi, Chair Powell. Thanks for taking our questions. Megan\nCassella with Barron’s. I want to ask about the balance sheet given the Fed’s focus now on\nproceeding carefully and considering rate cuts. And can you talk us through what the latest\nthinking is, and has there been any consideration of altering the pace of quantitative tightening\nat all?\nPage 22 of 24\nDecember 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. We’re, we’re not talking about altering the pace of QT right now,\njust to get that out of the way.\nSo the balance sheet seems to be working pretty much as expected. What we’ve been\nseeing is, you know, that we’re allowing runoff each month. That’s adding up. I think we’re\ndown—we’re close to 1.2 trillion [dollars]. That’s showing up. The reverse repo facility [take-\nup] has been coming down quickly, and reserves have been either moving up or—as a result—or\nholding steady. At a certain point, you know, there won’t be any more to come out of, or there’ll\nbe a level where [take-up at] the reverse repo facility levels out. And, at that point, reserves will\nstart to come down.\nYou know, we still have—you know that we intend to reduce our securities holdings until\nwe judge that the quantity of reserve balances has reached a level somewhat above that\nconsistent with ample reserves, and we also intend to slow and then stop the decline in size of the\nbalance sheet when reserve balances are somewhat above the level judged to be consistent with\nample reserves. We’re not at those levels, you know, with, with reserves close to 3.5 trillion\n[dollars]. We’re not—we don’t think we’re at those [levels judged consistent with ample]\nreserves. There isn’t a lot of evidence of that. We’re watching it carefully. And, you know, so\nfar—so far, it’s working pretty much as expected, we think.\nMEGAN CASSELLA. Do you anticipate adjusting that thinking at all by the time\nyou’re, you’re considering or moving forward with rate cuts? Is that time to rethink, or are you\nstill going to follow that thinking?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think they’re, they’re on independent tracks. You’re asking,\nthough, the question, I guess you’re implying the question of can you continue with QT at such\ntime—QT, which is a tightening action—at such time as policy is still tight? And the answer is,\nPage 23 of 24\nDecember 13, 2023 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nit depends on the reason. You know, if you’re—if you’re—if you’re cutting rates because you’re\ngoing back to normal, that’s one thing, [and distinct from] if you’re cutting them because the\neconomy is really weak. So you can imagine, you’d have to know what the reason is to know\nwhether it would be appropriate to do those two things at the same time.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Thanks very much.\nPage 24 of 24"

    "statement": "For release at 2:00 p.m. EST January 31, 2024\nRecent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace. Job\ngains have moderated since early last year but remain strong, and the unemployment rate has\nremained low. Inflation has eased over the past year but remains elevated.\nThe Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of\n2 percent over the longer run. The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment\nand inflation goals are moving into better balance. The economic outlook is uncertain, and the\nCommittee remains highly attentive to inflation risks.\nIn support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal\nfunds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent. In considering any adjustments to the target range for the\nfederal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and\nthe balance of risks. The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target\nrange until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.\nIn addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency\ndebt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in its previously announced plans.\nThe Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.\nIn assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to\nmonitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee\nwould be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that\ncould impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take\n(more)\n-2-\ninto account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions,\ninflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.\nVoting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H.

    "press_conf": "January 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nTranscript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference\nJanuary 31, 2024\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on\nour dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.\nThe economy has made good progress toward our dual-mandate objectives. Inflation has eased\nfrom its highs without a significant increase in unemployment. That’s very good news. But\ninflation is still too high, ongoing progress in bringing it down is not assured, and the path\nforward is uncertain. I want to assure the American people that we’re fully committed to\nreturning inflation to our 2 percent goal. Restoring price stability is essential to achieve a\nsustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.\nToday, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to\nreduce our securities holdings. Over the past two years, we’ve significantly tightened the stance\nof monetary policy. Our strong actions have moved our policy rate well into restrictive territory,\nand we’ve been seeing the effects on economic activity and inflation. As labor market tightness\nhas eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks to achieving our employment and\ninflation goals are moving into better balance. I will have more to say about monetary policy—\nabout monetary policy, after briefly reviewing economic developments.\nRecent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace.\nGDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year came in at 3.3 percent. For 2023 as a whole, GDP\nexpanded at 3.1 percent, bolstered by strong consumer demand as well as improving supply\nconditions. Activity in the housing sector was subdued over the past year, largely reflecting high\nmortgage rates. High interest rates also appear to have been weighing on business fixed\ninvestment.\nPage 1 of 27\nJanuary 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nThe labor market remains tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into\nbetter balance. Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 165,000 jobs per month, a\npace that is well below that seen a year ago but still strong. The unemployment rate remains low\nat 3.7 percent. Strong job creation has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of\nworkers. The labor force participation rate has moved up, on balance, over the past year,\nparticularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years, and immigration has returned to pre-pandemic\nlevels. Nominal wage growth has been easing, and job vacancies have declined. Although the\njobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers.\nInflation has eased notably over the past year but remains above our longer-run goal of\n2 percent. Total PCE prices rose 2.6 percent over the 12 months ending in December; excluding\nthe volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.9 percent. The lower inflation\nreadings over the second half of last year are welcome. But we will need to see continuing\nevidence to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our goal. Longer-\nterm inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of\nsurveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.\nThe Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware\nthat high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for\nthose least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.\nWe’re highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and\nwe’re strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.\nOver the past two years, we have raised our policy rate by 5¼ percentage points, and\nwe’ve decreased our securities holdings by more than $1.3 trillion. Our restrictive stance of\nPage 2 of 27\nJanuary 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nmonetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation. The\nCommittee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at\n5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings.\nWe believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle and that, if the\neconomy evolves broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy\nrestraint at some point this year. But the economy has surprised forecasters in many ways since\nthe pandemic, and ongoing progress toward our 2 percent inflation objective is not assured. The\neconomic outlook is uncertain, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks. We’re prepared\nto maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for longer if appropriate.\nAs labor market tightness has eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks to\nachieving our employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance. We know that\nreducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of the progress we’ve\nseen on inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation back to 2 percent. At\nthe same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic\nactivity and employment. In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal\nfunds rate, the Committee will carefully assess the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the\nbalance of risks. The Committee does not expect that it will be appropriate to reduce the target\nrange until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.\nWe will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting.\nWe remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to\nkeeping longer-run—longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Restoring price stability\nis essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the\nlonger run.\nPage 3 of 27\nJanuary 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nTo conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and\nbusinesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the\nFed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.\nThank you. I look forward to our questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jeanna.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times. Thanks for taking our\nquestions. Obviously, in the statement and just in your remarks there, you note that you don’t\nwant to cut interest rates without greater confidence that inflation is coming—coming down\nfully. I wonder—what do you need to see at this point to gain that confidence? And as you\nmake those decisions, how are you weighing recent strong growth in consumer spending data\nagainst the sort of solid inflation progress you’ve been seeing?\nCHAIR POWELL. Sorry—say that last part again.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. How are—how are you weighing the growth data and\nconsumption data, which have been surprisingly strong, against inflation data?\nCHAIR POWELL. Okay. So, what are we looking for to get greater confidence? Let\nme say that we have confidence. We’re—we’re looking for greater confidence that inflation is\nmoving sustainably down to 2 percent. Implicitly, we do have confidence, and it has been\nincreasing, but we want to get greater confidence. What do we want to see? We want to see\nmore good data. It’s not that we’re looking for better data. It’s—we’re looking at continuation\nof the good data that we’ve been seeing, and a good example is inflation. So we have six months\nof good inflation data. The question really is, that six months of good inflation data—is it\nsending us a true signal that we are, in fact, on a path—a sustainable path down to 2 percent\ninflation? That’s the question. And the answer will come from some more data that’s also good\nPage 4 of 27\nJanuary 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ndata. It doesn’t—it’s not that the six-month data isn’t—isn’t low enough. It is. It’s just a\nquestion of, can we take that with confidence that we’re moving sustainably down to 2 percent?\nThat’s really what we’re thinking about.\nIn terms of, of growth, we’ve had strong growth. I mean, if you take a step back, we’ve\nhad strong growth—very strong growth [in real GDP] last year—going right into the fourth\nquarter. And yet we’ve had a very strong labor market, and we’ve had inflation coming down.\nSo I think—whereas a year ago, we, we were thinking that we needed to see some softening in\neconomic activity—that hasn’t been the case. So I think we, we look at—we look at stronger\ngrowth. We don’t look at it as a problem. I think, at this point, we want to see strong growth.\nWe want to see a strong labor market. We’re not looking for a weaker labor market. We’re\nlooking for inflation to continue to come down, as it has been coming down for the last six\nmonths.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. And I’m sorry. If I could just follow up very quickly, the—when,\nwhen you say that you want to make sure that it’s a true signal, is there anything that you’re\nseeing in the data that makes you doubt that it’s a true signal at this stage?\nCHAIR POWELL. No, I think it’s—I, I would say it, it seems—it seems to be the likely\ncase that, that we will achieve that confidence, but we have to achieve it, and we haven’t yet.\nAnd so—I mean, it’s a good story. We have six months of good inflation [readings]. But you\ncan—and you know this—you can look behind those numbers, and you can see that a lot of it’s\nbeen coming from goods inflation, for example, and goods inflation running significantly\nnegative. It’s a reasonable assumption that, over time, goods inflation will flatten out—probably\napproximate zero. That would mean the services sectors would have to contribute more. So, in\nother words, what we care about is the aggregate number—not so much the composition. But\nPage 5 of 27\nJanuary 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nwe, we just need to see more. That’s where we are, as a Committee. We need to see more\nevidence that sort of confirms what we think we’re seeing and that tells us that we are on—gives\nus confidence that we’re on, on a path to—a sustainable path down to 2 percent inflation.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nick.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, it seems to\nme you raised rates rapidly over the last two years for two reasons. One was the risk of a wage–\nprice spiral. Two, there were risks of inflation expectations becoming unanchored. This\nmorning’s ECI report for the fourth quarter shows private-sector payroll growth running at a\nsub–4 percent pace. Inflation expectations are very close to where they were before the inflation\nemergency of the last three years. And, given that you appear to have substantially cut off these\ntwo tail risks and that you’ve judged here today current policy as well into restrictive territory,\nwhat good reason is there to keep policy rates above 5 percent? Are you really going to learn\nmore waiting six weeks versus three months from now that you have avoided those two risks?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, as you know, almost every participant on the Committee does\nbelieve that it will be appropriate to reduce rates and for, for—partly for the reasons that you say.\nYou know, we, we feel like inflation is coming down. Growth has been strong. The labor\nmarket is strong. We’re—what we’re trying to do is identify a place where we’re really\nconfident about inflation getting back down to 2 percent so that we can then begin the process of\ndialing back the restrictive level. So, overall, I think—I think people do believe—and, as you\nknow, the median participant wrote down three rate cuts this year. But I think to get to that place\nwhere we feel comfortable starting the process, we need some confirmation that inflation is, in\nfact, coming down sustainably to 2 percent.\nPage 6 of 27\nJanuary 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nNICK TIMIRAOS. If I could ask differently: If, if you hold rates high as inflation\nmoderates, as it—as it has been, target rates will exceed the prescriptions of the Taylor rule or its\nvariants. What would be the reasoning for holding rates higher than the levels recommended by\nthose rules in the current instance?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, I—look, I think, as you know, we consult the range of Taylor\nrules and, and non-Taylor kind of rules. We consult them regularly. They’re in our, our\nTealbook, and, and they’re in all the materials that we look at. But, you know, I don’t think\nwe’ve ever been at a—at a place where we were—where we were setting policy by them. And\nthere—depending on the rule, it will tell you different things. There are many different\nformulations. Another way to think about it is, implicitly, is—so, in theory, of course, real rates\ngo up if—holding all else equal—as inflation comes down. But that doesn’t mean we can\nmechanically adjust policy as real rates—sorry—as inflation comes down. It doesn’t mean that\nat all, because, for one thing, we, we don’t know—we, we look at more than just the fed funds\nrate. We look at—broadly—financial conditions.\nBut, in addition, we don’t know with great confidence where the neutral rate of interest is\nat any given time. But that also doesn’t mean that we wait around for—to see, you know, the\neconomy turn down, because that would be too late. So we’re really in a risk-management\nmode: of managing the risk—as I mentioned in my opening remarks—managing the risk that we\nmove too soon and move too late. And I think to move, which is—which is where almost\neveryone on the Committee is—is in favor of, of moving rates down this year—but the timing of\nthat is going to be linked to our gaining confidence that inflation is on a sustainable path down to\n2 percent.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Howard.\nPage 7 of 27\nJanuary 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Hi. Thanks, Chair Powell. I’d like you to, to key in on the\nuse of the word in, in the statement that inflation still “remains elevated.” You’ve pledged to cut\nrates before inflation reached 2 percent. So that implies that there’s some sort of intermediate\nstep here on, on inflation and that a, a cut would be consequent with a change in the statement\nlanguage that inflation “remains elevated.” What’s the step-down from there?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah, I, I don’t know that we’ve worked out the particulars—\nstatement language and that kind of thing. I would just say, if you look at—you know, look at\nwhere, where 12-month inflation is, and it’s, you know, it’s still well above—core is 2.9 percent,\nfor example—12-month—which is way down from where it was. Very, very positive\ndevelopment—very fast decline—and, and, you know, the, the case is likely that it will continue\nto come down. So, so that’s where—that’s where it is. But we’re, you know, we’re wanting to\nsee, you know, more data.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. So, if I—if I could follow up on that, the statement allows\nthat you want greater confidence on inflation falling before you cut, but it doesn’t mention the\nother side of the mandate—a slide in employment. Would a slide in employment also bring you\nto the point of, of cutting rates?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes. So let me say that we’re not looking for that. That’s not\nsomething we’re looking for. But, yes, if you think about, you know—in, in the base case, the\neconomy is performing well—the labor market remains strong. If we saw an unexpected\nweakening in, in—certainly in the labor market, that would certainly weigh on cutting sooner.\nAbsolutely. And if we saw inflation being stickier or higher or those sorts of things—would\nargue for moving later. In the base case, though, where, where the economy is healthy and we\nhave, you know, we have ongoing growth—solid growth—we have a strong labor market—we\nPage 8 of 27\nJanuary 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nhave inflation coming down—that’s what people are writing their SEP [submissions] around.\nAnd in that case, what we’re saying is, based on that, we think we can and should take advantage\nof that and, and be careful as we approach that question of when to begin to dial back restriction.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Claire.\nCLAIRE JONES. Claire Jones, Financial Times. Just to circle back to the “greater\nconfidence” aspect of the statement, there’s been a lot of unanimity in recent meetings. I’m just\nwondering, going forward, when it comes to all needing greater confidence, is there unanimity\nor, at least, consensus among FOMC members about what the threshold for that greater\nconfidence is? And if not, could you maybe tell us a little bit about the discussion today on, you\nknow, what the variations between FOMC members was on what constitutes enough confidence\nto cut rates and also if there was any variation on how quickly that “greater confidence”\nthreshold could be reached? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So we’re not—we’re not really at that stage. You know, we’re—\nwe’re—there was no proposal to cut rates. Some people did, you know, talk about their view of\nthe rate path. I would point you to the [December 2023] SEP as, as, you know, as good evidence\nof where people are, although it is—it is [now] one [FOMC meeting] cycle later. So, you know,\nwe’re not—we’re not at a place of, of really working out those kinds of details, because we\nweren’t actively considering, you know, a—moving, moving the federal funds rate down. I will\nsay, there is a—there is a wide disparity—a healthy disparity—of views, and you see that in\npublic, public statements, in the minutes, and the transcripts when they’re released every five\nyears. So we do have a healthy set of differences, and I think that’s actually essential for making\ngood policy. We’re also able to reach agreement, generally, because we listen to each other—\nPage 9 of 27\nJanuary 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nwe, we compromise. And even though not everybody loves what we do, they’re able to—for the\nmost part—able to join in. To me, that’s a well-functioning public institution.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Rachel.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Hi, Chair Powell. Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. Thanks\nfor taking our questions. So, over the past few years, there have been all these real-time\nindicators that helped us gain a sharper understanding of where the economy was, like\nOpenTable data or office attendance. You’ve talked about vacancies in the past. And I’m\nwondering, at the start of this year, what might be on that dashboard for you that’s giving you the\nclearest picture of the economy—including on rents—if you could touch on that.\nCHAIR POWELL. Including?\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Rent. Rent costs.\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah. Well, so we’re not—you know, it’s not the pandemic, so we\ncan actually rely on more, more traditional forms. People are working. They’re getting wages,\nand, and the economy has largely reopened and is broadly normalizing, as you see. So I\nwouldn’t say we’re looking at that, that sort of more innovative data as much. You know, you\npoint to rents. So, of course, we follow the, the components of inflation very carefully. Which\nwould be: Goods inflation—I talked about that a little bit; you mentioned housing inflation. So\nthe question is, when will these lower market rents find their way into measured rents, as\nmeasured, measured in PCE inflation?\nAnd we think that’s coming, and we know it’s coming. It’s just a question of when and,\nand how big it’ll be. So—but that’s in, in everyone’s forecast, I would say. So that will—that\nwill help. But at the same time, we think goods inflation will probably—it’s been giving a lot of\ndisinflation to the effort—and probably that declines over time, but it may well have some, some\nPage 10 of 27\nJanuary 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nmore time to run. You know, these—the supply chains are not perfectly back to where they\nwere. In addition, it takes time for the, the healing process to get into prices. So there may be\nstill a tailwind. We’ll find out with, with that. So we look at the things that relate to our\nmandate very carefully, and—as you would imagine.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. I guess, just as a quick follow-up—do you feel comfortable at this\npoint saying the economy has reached a soft landing, or is that part of looking for more\nconfidence?\nCHAIR POWELL. No, I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t say we’ve achieved that. And I, I think\nwe have—we have a ways to go. Inflation is still—you know, core inflation is still well above\ntarget on a 12-month basis. Twelve months is our, our target, certainly. I’m encouraged, and\nwe’re encouraged by the progress. But, you know, we’re, we’re not—we’re not declaring\nvictory at all at this point. We think we have a ways to go.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You’ve said that you would know the\nneutral rate by its works. So I’m wondering what you could tell me—how do you believe the\nneutral rate is working or telling you right now that growth is stronger? In other words, how\nmuch is the economy really being restrained right now by the current funds rate? And how much\nrestraint does it really need, additionally, if inflation is still coming down?\nCHAIR POWELL. So it’s—I think you, you do see in the interest-sensitive parts of the\neconomy—you do see, for example, housing. You see the effects. You do. Your, your second\nquestion, though, really, I think, is important, and that is, a lot of this has come through—a lot of\nthe disinflationary process has come through the healing of supply chains and also of the labor\nmarket. So you’ve seen the—you know, that other set of factors is really different from other\nPage 11 of 27\nJanuary 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ncycles and has brought that working with tighter, tighter policy, which has enabled the supply\nside to recover—I think is that, that mixture has been behind what has enabled this. So, no—we\nreally do think that we’re having an effect broadly across the economy. I would point to the\ninterest-sensitive parts of the economy as well as spending, generally. But it’s a—it’s a joint\nstory. It’s a complicated story.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. But, but how much restraint are you actually imparting to the\neconomy, would you say, relative to the neutral rate?\nCHAIR POWELL. It’s—so I think it’s, it’s—of course, you know that it’s not something\nyou can identify with any precision. But if you—a standard approach would be to take the\nnominal rate—5.3 percent, let’s say—and subtract sort of a, a forward measure of inflation. If\nyou do that—and there are many, many ways to calculate the neutral rate—but that’s one I like\nto do. And, you know, you’re going to get to something that is materially above mainstream\nestimates of neutrality—of the neutral rate—you will. And—but at the same time, you look at\nthe economy, and you say, “This is an economy that grew 3.1 percent last year.” And, and you\nsay, “What does that tell you about the neutral rate?” What’s happening, though, is, the supply\nside has been recovering in the middle of this. So that, that won’t go on forever. So a lot of the\ngrowth we’re seeing is not—is—it isn’t just a tug of war between, between interest rates and\ndemand. You’re getting, you know, more activity because of the—of labor market healing and\nsupply chains healing. So I think the question is, when that peters out, I think the, the, you\nknow, the, the restriction will show up probably more, more sharply.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Rich.\nRICH MILLER. Thank you—sorry. Thanks for taking the question, Mr. Chairman.\nYou mentioned earlier we’re not seeking a weaker labor market, I think you, you said. Can you\nPage 12 of 27\nJanuary 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ntalk a little bit more about that? Do you—do you think the labor market now is back to quote,\nunquote, “normal” and that the—we can achieve the inflation target without wage gains coming\nback down to what they were pre-pandemic? Even with today’s ECI levels, they were still above\nthose pre-pandemic levels.\nCHAIR POWELL. I, I think the labor market by many measures is at or nearing\nnormal—but not totally back to normal. And you pointed to one or more of them. So I think,\nyou know, job openings are not quite back to where they were. Wages—wage increases, rather,\nare not quite back to where they—to where they would need to be in the longer run. I, I would\nlook at it this way, though. The, the economy is broadly normalizing, and so is the labor market.\nAnd that process will probably take some time. So wage setting is something that happens—it’s,\nit’s—you know, probably will take a couple of years to get all the way back. And that’s okay.\nThat’s okay. But we do see—you saw today’s ECI reading—you know, the evidence is that, that\nwage increases are still at a healthy level—very healthy level—but they’re gradually moving\nback to levels that would be more associated—given, given assumptions about productivity, are\nmore typically associated with 2 percent inflation. It’s, it’s an ongoing process—a healthy one—\nand, and, you know, I think we’re, we’re moving in the right direction.\nRICH MILLER. So that process can continue without a weakening of the labor market,\nbasically, you’re saying?\nCHAIR POWELL. I think the, the labor market is—it—I don’t know if I’d—it’s\nrebalancing. Clearly, that the—there was a fairly severe imbalance between demand for workers\nand supply at the beginning of the pandemic. So we lost several million workers at the\nbeginning of the pandemic from people dropping out of the labor force. And then when the\neconomy reopened—you remember 2021—you had a severe labor shortage, and it was just—it\nPage 13 of 27\nJanuary 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nwas everywhere—panic on the part of businesses—couldn’t, couldn’t find people. So, what’s\nhappened is—we expected labor—the labor supply—labor market to come back quickly, and it\ndidn’t. And 2022 was a disappointing year, and, you know, we were kind of thinking, “Well,\nmaybe we won’t get it back.” And then 2023, we did, as you know—so labor force participation\ncame back strongly in ’23, and so did immigration. Immigration came to a halt during the\npandemic.\nSo—and so those two forces have significantly lowered the temperature in the labor\nmarket to what is still a very strong labor market. It’s still a good labor market for wages and for\nfinding a job, but it’s getting back into balance, and that’s what we want to see. And, you know,\none great way to look at that is what’s happening with, with wage increases. And you see it now\nacross the, the major things that we—that we track. It isn’t every quarter, but, overall, there’s a\nclear trend—still at high levels, but back down to where—what would be consistent with, with\nwhere we were before the pandemic and with 2 percent inflation.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Chris.\nCHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Hi, Chris Rugaber at Associated Press. Thank you. I\nwanted to follow up on Rich’s question. It sounded like you suggested that you’re not worried\nabout faster growth so much—so wanted to see if you’re seeing anything that suggests that\ninflation could reaccelerate from here. And it sounds like you’re saying you’re not worried that\nsolid growth from here on out poses any risk to inflation. Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. No, I think that that is a risk—the risk that inflation would, would\nreaccelerate. I think the, the greater risk is that it would—that it would stabilize at a level\nmeaningfully above 2 percent. That’s, that’s, to me, more likely. Of course, if—if inflation were\nto surprise by moving back up, that would—we would have to respond to that, and that would—\nPage 14 of 27\nJanuary 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthat would be a surprise at this point. But I have to tell you, that’s why we keep our options open\nhere and why we’re not, you know, rushing. So I, I think both of those are risks, but I think the\nmore likely risk is the one that I mentioned, which is, you’ve had six good months—very good\nmonths—but what, what’s really going to “shake out” here? You know, where—what will—\nwhen we look back, what will we see? Will, will inflation have dipped and then come back up?\nAre the last six months flattered by factors that are—that are one-off factors that won’t repeat\nthemselves? We don’t think so. We don’t—you know, that’s not what we think, but that’s the\nquestion we are asking. We have to ask [that], and we want to get comfort on that.\nCHRISTOPHER RUGABER. And just one quick follow-up—Governor Waller had\nmentioned the revisions that are coming on February 9th for the CPI data. Is that something\nyou’re watching as well? And if, if we see those revisions fairly minor, is that going to give you\nmore confidence where things are going?\nCHAIR POWELL. We’ll just have to see. Yeah. We’ll—we look at those. Last year\nwas a—was a, a surprise.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Mike.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee, Bloomberg Radio and Television. If you don’t\nwant to use the term “soft landing,” would you say, at least, that, from your point of view now,\nthe other scenario of a hard landing caused by the Fed is off the table or the risks have\ndiminished very much? And you mentioned below–2 percent inflation for—on a three-month\nbasis, core PCE has been running at 1½ percent. And there are those on Wall Street who think\nthat if you maintain the level of restriction you have right now, you could end up with inflation\nrunning below your target. How do you see that?\nPage 15 of 27\nJanuary 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. So, how to—your first question—how to describe where we are? So\nI guess I would just say this—executive summary would be that growth is solid to strong over\nthe course of last year. The labor market—3.7 percent unemployment indicates that the labor\nmarket is strong. We’ve had just about two years now of, of unemployment under 4 percent.\nThat hasn’t happened in 50 years. So it’s a good labor market. And we’ve seen inflation come\ndown. We’ve talked about that. So we’ve got six months of good inflation data and an\nexpectation that there’s more to come. So this is a—this is a good situation. Let’s be honest.\nThis is a—this is a good economy.\nBut what’s the outlook? That’s looking in the rearview—the outlook—we do expect\ngrowth to moderate. Of course, we have expected it for some time, and it hasn’t happened, but\nwe do expect that it will moderate as supply chain and labor market normalization runs its\ncourse. The labor market is rebalancing, as, as I mentioned. Job creation has slowed. The base\nof job growth has narrowed. And, of course, 12-month inflation is, is above target and getting,\nyou know, getting down closer to target. It’s not guaranteed, but we do seem to be getting on\ntrack for that. So those are the risks and, and questions we have to answer. But, overall, this is a\npretty good picture. It, it is a good picture. Your second question was—sorry.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Could you get inflation that is below target—end up with inflation\nbelow target, and you have to do something about that?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we—the thing is, we’re not looking for inflation to tap the\n2 percent base once. We’re looking for it to settle out over time at 2 percent. And the same\nthing is true if we have a month or two of lower—and we have that now—of, of inflation that’s\nannualized at a—at a lower level—that wouldn’t be good. We’re not—you know, we’re not\nlooking to have inflation anchor below 2 percent. We’re looking to have it anchor at 2 percent.\nPage 16 of 27\nJanuary 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nSo if we do face those circumstances, then we’ll have to deal with that. I think—I think as of\nnow, you know, the, the question, which—we want to take advantage of this situation and finish\nthe job on inflation while keeping the labor market strong.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Edward.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Edward Lawrence from Fox Business. Thank you,\nMr. Chairman, for taking this. So, as I’ve—as I’ve heard from some District Fed presidents, is\nit, in your view, a little premature to think that rate cuts are right around the corner? And then\nwhen we do see that first rate cut, is that—should we interpret that as the beginning of a rate-cut\ncycle, or is it a one-off?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I’ll point you to that language on your first question. We, we\nincluded that language in the statement to signal clearly that—with strong growth, strong labor\nmarket, inflation coming down—the Committee intends to move carefully as we consider when\nto begin to dial back the restrictive stance that we have in place. So if you take that to the current\ncontext—current context, we’re going to be data dependent. We’re going to be looking at this\nmeeting by meeting. Based on the meeting today, I would tell you that I don’t think it’s likely\nthat the Committee will reach a level of confidence by the time of the March meeting to identify\nMarch as the time to do that. But that’s, that’s to be seen. So I wouldn’t call—you know, when\nyou say—when you ask me about “in the near term,” I’m hearing that as March. I would say I\ndon’t think that’s—that’s, that’s probably not the most likely case or what we would call the base\ncase. And your second question is—\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. On, on the—is this the start of a—when we see a cut, is it the\nstart of a cutting cycle, or is it—could it just be a one-off?\nPage 17 of 27\nJanuary 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, that’s going to depend on the data. The whole thing is,\nthis is going to depend on the data. We’re going to be looking at the economic data as it affects\nthe outlook and the balance of risks. And we’re going to make our decisions based on that. And\nit could wind up—you know, we’ll, we’ll have another SEP at the March meeting, and, and\npeople will write down what they think. But, in the end, it’s really going to depend on how the\neconomy evolves. We talked about, there are risks that would cause us to go slower—for\nexample, stronger inflation—more, more persistent inflation. There are risks that would cause us\nto—if they happen—that would cause us to go faster or—and sooner. And that would be a\nweakening in the labor market or, for that matter, very, very persuasive lower inflation. Those\nare the kinds of things. So we’re just—we’re just going to be reacting to the data. That’s the—\nthat’s really the only way we can do this.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi. Victoria Guida with Politico. Could you talk a little bit more\nabout productivity growth? You know, you’ve mentioned multiple times about, you know, the\nlevel of wage growth that’s consistent with 2 percent inflation. We’ve obviously seen, you\nknow—you were talking about ECI this morning, in which it’s cooled a little bit but still sort of\nabove what you wanted to see. Growth has been very strong. How much of those numbers do\nyou attribute to productivity? And do you see that productivity as sort of just temporary because\nof the factors—the labor and supply chain factors you were talking about—or do you think that\nproductivity growth will, will fade over time?\nCHAIR POWELL. So this is a really interesting question. And I think—my, my own\nview is—I think if you look, look back to the pandemic, you, you saw a spike in productivity as\nworkers were laid off, and, and activity didn’t decline as fast. And then you saw a deep trough\nPage 18 of 27\nJanuary 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nof productivity. And then, over the last—you saw high productivity last year, in ’23. I think\nwe’re, we’re basically in the throes of getting through the pandemic economy. And the question\nwill be, what, what is it that has changed the—you know, the productivity tends to be based on,\nyou know, fundamental aspects of our economy. Is there—is there a case—will it be the case\nthat we come out of this more productive on a sustained basis? And I don’t know. I don’t know.\nWhat would it take? It would take—you know, people talk about AI, but I would—my guess is\nthat we may shake out and be back where we were, because I don’t—I’m not sure I see—work\nfrom home doesn’t seem like it’s a big productivity increase. Or AI, artificial intelligence—\ngenerative it may be, but probably not in the short run—probably, maybe in the longer run. So\nI’m not—I’m not seeing why it would, but, you know, right—you know, right now I would say\nthat productivity is kind of what falls out of the, the broader forces that are driving people in and\nout of the labor force and, and activity returning and supply chains getting fixed.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Right. So would that be behind why we’ve seen such strong\ngrowth, but we’ve also seen inflation fall—that maybe there’s just a higher level of productivity?\nCHAIR POWELL. That’s one way to look at it. Yeah.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nancy.\nNANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Hi, Chair Powell. Nancy Marshall-Genzer with\nMarketplace. I want to ask a little bit more about housing. I’m wondering—how closely are you\nwatching rent and housing prices as you evaluate whether and when to cut rates? And it seems\nlike housing prices are not coming down as quickly as you expected.\nCHAIR POWELL. So when we think about, you know—our, our statutory goals are\nmaximum employment and price stability, and that’s what we’re targeting. We’re not targeting\nhousing price inflation, the cost of housing, or any of those things. Those are very important\nPage 19 of 27\nJanuary 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthings for people’s lives. But they’re not—you know, those are not the things we’re targeting.\nWe’re also well aware that when we cut rates at the beginning of the pandemic, for example, the\nhousing, housing industry was helped more than any other industry. And when we raise rates,\nthe housing industry can be hurt, because it’s a very interest-sensitive sector.\nOn top of that, we have longer-run problems with the availability of housing. You know,\nwe have a, a built-up set of cities, and, and, you know, people are moving further and further out.\nSo there’s—there hasn’t been enough housing built. And these are not—these are not things that\nwe have any tools to address. But, you know, where it comes into play very specifically in our\nwork is inflation, which is a combination. It’s, it’s really rental inflation. You’re taking owners’\nequivalent rent and then actual rent paid by tenants. And you’re, you’re running that through the\nCPI calculation. Or the PCE [inflation] calculation—the one we look at. And what that’s telling\nyou is that market rents are increasing at a much lower rate or even being flat and that that will\nshow up in inflation over time. It has to as long as that remains the case.\nNANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. And just real quick—what is your response to the\nletter that was sent to you by some members of Congress asking the Fed to lower interest rates to\nmake housing more affordable?\nCHAIR POWELL. My response is what I started with, which is that our, our job—the\njob Congress has given us is price stability and maximum employment. Price stability is\nabsolutely essential for people’s lives, most importantly for—well, not most importantly—most,\nmostly for people at the lower end of the income spectrum who are living at the edges—at the\nmargins. And so someone—for someone like that, high inflation in the—in the necessities of\nlife—right away, you’re in trouble, whereas even middle-class people have some, you know,\nsome scope to absorb higher costs. So we have to get—it’s our job. It’s what society has asked\nPage 20 of 27\nJanuary 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nus to do, is to get inflation down, and the tools that we use to do it are interest rates. So that’s\nhow we think about that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Courtenay.\nCOURTENAY BROWN. Courtenay Brown from Axios. Can you give us some insight\ninto whether the Committee discussed the possibility of slowing balance sheet runoff in the\nmonths ahead?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes. So I would start by saying that balance sheet runoff so far has\ngone very well. And as the process has continued, you know, we’re getting to that time where\nquestions are beginning to come into greater focus about the pace of runoff and all that. So at\nthis meeting, we did have some discussion of the balance sheet, and we’re planning to begin in-\ndepth discussions of balance sheet issues at our next meeting in March. So those, those\nquestions are all coming into scope now, and we’re focusing on them. But we’re, we’re at the\nbeginning of that process, I would say.\nCOURTENAY BROWN. Quick follow-up—is it the case that the Fed would decide to\nlower rates and make adjustments to the balance sheet runoff in tandem?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes, we do—we see those as independent tools. And so they\ndon’t—for example, if you’re—if you’re normalizing policy, you might be reducing rates but\ncontinuing to run off the balance sheet. In both cases, that’s normalization, but from a strict\nmonetary policy standpoint, you could say we’re loosening along with tightening. So that, that\ncould happen. It’s not something we’re planning or thinking about, but right now, we’re\nthinking about getting to a place where—we’re going to see the balance sheet runoff to continue.\nWe’re watching it carefully, and, as I said, we’ll—we’ll be looking into that as a Committee\nstarting in March.\nPage 21 of 27\nJanuary 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCOURTENAY BROWN. Thanks.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Simon.\nSIMON RABINOVITCH. Simon Rabinovitch with the Economist. Thank you, Chair\nPowell. You’ve mentioned six good months of inflation data, but that not being enough to build\nup confidence. Based on your previous response that your base case is you probably wouldn’t\nstart easing yet in March, the implication is that eight good months might not be enough, either.\nRoughly how many months do you think you might need of, of good inflation data to be—to be\nconfident?\nCHAIR POWELL. I’m, I’m not in a position to put a number on it. I’m just going to\nsay—and it’s not that we don’t have any confidence. We, we have growing confidence, but not\nto the point where we—where we feel like—it’s a highly consequential decision to start the\nprocess of, of dialing back on restriction. And we want to get that right, and we feel like the\nstrong economy, strong labor market, inflation coming down—it gives us the ability to do that.\nWe think that’s the best way we can serve the public, because, ultimately, we, we’ve made a lot\nof progress on inflation. We just want to make sure that we do get the job done in a sustainable\nway. That’s how we’re thinking about it. In terms of when that’ll be, you know, that, that’ll all\ncome out of our communications, and, you know, we won’t—we won’t keep that a secret.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Evan.\nEVAN RYSER. Hi, Chair Powell. Evan Ryser with MNI Market News. Can you\nexplain a little bit more on what you’re considering when tapering QT? Do you need to see the\novernight reverse repo facility all the way down to zero, or is it something that you can start with\na couple hundred billion dollars there?\nPage 22 of 27\nJanuary 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. Not a decision that we’ve made, but I, I wouldn’t think we’d, we’d\nbe—we wouldn’t be taking a position that it’s got to go to zero. I mean, if it—if it were to\nstabilize at a different level—but that’s, that’s not a decision that we’ve made. That’s, that’s\nwhat we’ll be talking about at the March meeting. A whole range of issues will be briefed up,\nand the Committee will get into—get into all of the issues that will be arising over the course of\nthe next, let’s say, year or so.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Greg.\nGREG ROBB. Thanks. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. Chair Powell, I want to change\ngears a little bit. In the presidential primary campaign that’s been going on for the last nine\nmonths or so, your name has come up often, and many Republican candidates had said that they\nprobably wouldn’t want to give you a third term. So I wanted to give you a chance to talk about\nthat. Do you want another term—you’ve had—on the Fed? What, what’s your stance on that?\nCHAIR POWELL. I don’t have a stance on that. It’s not something I’m focused on.\n[We’re] focused on doing our jobs. We have—this year is going to be a highly consequential\nyear for, for the Fed and for monetary policy. And we’re, all of us, very buckled down, focused\non doing our jobs.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jennifer.\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. Thank you, Chair Powell. Jennifer Schonberger with\nYahoo Finance. As you mentioned, core PCE [inflation] has been running at 1.9 percent over\nthe past six months. And you guys are actually expecting core inflation higher this year, at 2.4\npercent, compared to that six-month measure. Given that forecast and that the median is for\nthree rate cuts this year, what happens if inflation stays where it’s been over the last six months\nfor the next six months?\nPage 23 of 27\nJanuary 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. So I—you know, we’re going to do—we’ll update our, our inflation\nforecasts at the next meeting. You referred to the December meeting. That’s, that’s, you know,\nthree months old [by March], so it might be lower now, given the data we’ve gotten. So, look, as\nI mentioned, we’re going to be reacting to the data. If, if we get—if we get very strong inflation\ndata and it, it kicks back up, then it’ll—then we’ll go slower or later or both. If we got really\ngood inflation data soon, that would matter for both the—that, that would tell us that, that we\ncould go sooner and perhaps go faster. So we’re just going to be—but, of course, we’ll weigh\nthat with all the other factors. We’re setting policy based on the totality of, of the data.\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. But just to follow—if inflation stays where it is currently,\nthat would probably mean that the real interest rate becomes more restrictive. Would that mean\nyou’d have to trim more, perhaps, than you already have factored in?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, I think if we—if we came to the view that, that inflation\nwere—that the six-month inflation numbers, which are very close to 2 [percent], were, in “PCE\nworld”—if we came to—if that’s—if we thought that is really where we’re going to be, then,\nyes, our policy would be in a different place. It would. But, you know, that’s the whole point is,\nwe’re trying to get comfortable and gain confidence that that is where—that inflation is on a\nsustainable path down to 2 percent or toward 2 percent.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Daniel.\nDANIEL AVIS. Hi, Chair Powell. Daniel Avis, Agence France-Presse. I just wondered\nif I could get your comment on the recent consumer confidence data. It seems to suggest that\nconsumers are sort of moving towards a much more optimistic view of the economy. I just\nwonder—is it fair to say that they’re moving towards where the Fed appears to have been in\nPage 24 of 27\nJanuary 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nrecent months? And, you know, do you think that inflation and falling inflation perhaps has\nplayed a role in that? And what challenges do you see, going forward? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah, so it’s been—it’s been interesting that confidence surveys\nhave been weak, at a time when unemployment has been low—very low, historically low—for a\ncouple of years. And—but, nonetheless, that’s been the case. And we’ve asked ourselves why\nthat is. And, you know, one obvious answer—we don’t pretend to have perfect wisdom on\nthis—is—but one obvious answer is that the price level is high. So prices went up much more\nthan 2 percent for year—per year for a couple of years. And people are going to the store, and\nthey’re paying much more for the basics of life than they were two years ago—three years ago.\nAnd they’re not happy about it. And it’s fine that inflation is coming down, but the price—the\nprices they’re paying are still high.\nSo that, that is what—that, that has to be some part of why people are unhappy. And\nthey’re, they’re right to be unhappy. You know, this is why we need to keep price stability. It’s\nwhy we need to do our jobs—so that people don’t have to deal with things like this.\nIn terms of [surveys]—you’re right. In, in recent, recent surveys, a couple of—you’ve\nseen a couple of significant increases in, in consumer confidence or, or happiness with the\neconomy. I guess that’s a good thing. That can—that can support spending—can support\neconomic activity. There’s some evidence of that. But it is—it is a fact that we have seen, you\nknow, a meaningful increase. I think levels of confidence are still maybe not as high as they’ve\nbeen at various times. But it’s—they certainly have come up.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Bryan.\nBRYAN MENA. Thank you for taking our questions. Bryan Mena, CNN Business.\nCommittee members have said they’d like to meet with business leaders and stakeholders in\nPage 25 of 27\nJanuary 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nperson to learn more about the economy in real time, given that some data is subject to large\nrevisions, the issue of seasonal adjustments being thrown off balance, and many readings of the\neconomy being quarterly. So did any members say they’ve learned anything not reflected in the\ndata? Or have you yourself learned anything through anecdotal evidence that hasn’t been\ncaptured in the data yet?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, yes. I’m, I’m a big believer that—yes. So we, we do meet\nwith outside groups who come from all different parts of the economy. And I always feel like\nyou—I mean, I spent most of my life in the private sector looking at companies—individual\ncompanies—individual management teams—and then building out from that. And so, starting\nwith GDP data is—and working into what’s actually affecting people’s lives is—is challenging.\nIt’s very hard. So I, I really like anecdotal data. In addition, as you know, the 12 Reserve Banks\nhave really the best network of anyone. In all their Districts, they’re talking to, you know, not\njust the business community, but the educational, medical, all, all—you know, nonprofit\ncommunity. They have arms into all of that. And so when they come back—that’s what goes\ninto the Beige Book. But they come back, and what each Reserve Bank president does is, during\nthe outlook go-around, they’ll say, “In my District . . .” And they’ll talk about 100 conversations\nthey—not—they won’t talk—they, they will give you input, based on 100 conversations that\nthey’ve had with people of all different walks. And it’s—I personally find it very helpful in\nunderstanding what’s going on. And also, I think you hear things before they show up in the\ndata sometimes.\nBRYAN MENA. Did any of them—did any of them notice slowing economy based on\nwhat they’ve heard from, like, their District?\nPage 26 of 27\nJanuary 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes. I mean, if you—if you look back at the last—not this Beige\nBook, but the one before, it was more—there was a lot of “slower activity.” I think that, that\nwhat you’re hearing now is, is, things are picking up a bit. You’re hearing—not, not in every\nDistrict and not every, every person that we talk to, but you’re—overall, it feels like you’re\nhearing things picking up at the margin. So that’s what comes through.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Jeff Cox for the last question.\nJEFF COX. Thank you, sir. Jeff Cox from CNBC.com. Just kind of looking to put it all\ntogether: You talked about basically the, the economy looking strong with 3.3 percent\nannualized growth in the fourth quarter. Does the strength of the economy speak more loudly to\nyou now than any inflation threat might? That, you know—you’re in a position, in other words,\nto keep rates elevated as long as the economy stays strong, and you’re more—you’re more tilted\ntowards that. And also, perhaps, are you worried at all that the economy is maybe a little too\nstrong right now and that inflation could come back at some point?\nCHAIR POWELL. I’m not so worried about that. You know, it’s—again, we’ve had\ninflation come down without a slow economy and without, you know, important increases in, in\nunemployment, and there’s no reason why we should want to get in the way of that process, if\nit’s going to continue. So I, I am—you know, I think—I think declining inflation—continued\ndeclines in inflation are, are really the main thing we’re looking at. Of course, we want the labor\nmarket to remain strong, too.\nWe don’t have a growth mandate. We’ve got a, a maximum-employment mandate and a,\na price-stability mandate, and those are the two things we look at. Growth only matters to the\nextent it influences our achievement of those two—of those two mandates.\nThank you very much.\nPage 27 of 27"

The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment\nand inflation goals are moving into better balance. The economic outlook is uncertain, and the\nCommittee remains highly attentive to inflation risks.\nIn support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal\nfunds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent. In considering any adjustments to the target range for the\nfederal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and\nthe balance of risks. The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target\nrange until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.\nIn addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency\ndebt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in its previously announced plans.\nThe Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.\nIn assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to\nmonitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee\nwould be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that\ncould impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals.

    "press_conf": "March 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nTranscript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference\nMarch 20, 2024\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on\nour dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.\nThe economy has made considerable progress toward our dual-mandate objectives. Inflation has\neased substantially while the labor market has remained strong, and that is very good news. But\ninflation is still too high, ongoing progress in bringing it down is not assured, and the path\nforward is uncertain. We are fully committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.\nRestoring price stability is essential to achieve a sustainably strong labor market that benefits all.\nToday, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to\nreduce our securities holdings. Our restrictive stance of monetary policy has been putting\ndownward pressure on economic activity and inflation. As labor market tightness has eased and\nprogress on inflation has continued, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals\nare moving into better balance. I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly\nreviewing economic developments.\nRecent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace.\nGDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year came in at 3.2 percent. For 2023 as a whole, GDP\nexpanded 3.1 percent, bolstered by strong consumer demand as well as improving supply\nconditions. Activity in the housing sector was subdued over the past year, largely reflecting high\nmortgage rates. High interest rates also appear to have weighed on business fixed investment. In\nour Summary of Economic Projections, Committee participants generally expect GDP growth to\nslow from last year’s pace, with a median projection of 2.1 percent this year and 2 percent over\nthe next two years. Participants generally revised up their growth projections since December,\nreflecting the strength of incoming data, including data on labor supply.\nPage 1 of 24\nMarch 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nThe labor market remains relatively tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to\ncome into better balance. Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 265,000 jobs\nper month. The unemployment rate has edged up but remains low at 3.9 percent. Strong job\ncreation has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers, reflecting increases in\nparticipation among individuals aged 25 to 54 years and a continued strong pace of immigration.\nNominal wage growth has been easing, and job vacancies have declined. Although the jobs-to-\nworkers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers. FOMC\nparticipants expect the rebalancing in the labor market to continue, easing upward pressure on\ninflation. The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP is 4.0 percent at the end of this\nyear and 4.1 percent at the end of next year.\nInflation has eased notably over the past year but remains above our longer-run goal of\n2 percent. Estimates based on the consumer price index and other data indicate that total PCE\nprices rose 2.5 percent over the 12 months ending in February and that, excluding the volatile\nfood and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent. Longer-term inflation\nexpectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of\nhouseholds, businesses, and forecasters as well as from measures from financial markets. The\nmedian projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation falls to 2.4 percent this year, 2.2 percent\nnext year, and 2 percent in 2026.\nThe Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware\nthat high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for\nthose least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We\nare strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.\nPage 2 of 24\nMarch 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nThe Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal\nfunds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities\nholdings. As labor market tightness has eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks\nto achieving our employment and inflation goals are coming into better balance. We believe that\nour policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle and that, if the economy evolves\nbroadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some\npoint this year. The economic outlook is uncertain, however, and we remain highly attentive to\ninflation risks. We are prepared to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for\nlonger, if appropriate.\nWe know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of\nthe progress we have seen on inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation\nback to 2 percent. At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly\nweaken economic activity and employment. In considering any adjustments to the target range\nfor the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving\noutlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce\nthe target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down\ntoward 2 percent. Of course, we’re committed to both sides of our dual mandate, and an\nunexpected weakening in the labor market could also warrant a policy response. We will\ncontinue to make our decisions meeting by meeting.\nIn our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an\nappropriate path for the federal funds rate based on what each participant judges to be the most\nlikely scenario going forward. If the economy evolves as projected, the median participant\nprojects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 4.6 percent at the end of this\nPage 3 of 24\nMarch 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nyear, 3.9 percent at the end of 2025, and 3.1 percent at the end of 2026, still above the medium—\nmedian longer-term funds rate. These projections are not a Committee decision or plan; if the\neconomy does not evolve as projected, the path for policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our\nmaximum-employment and price-stability goals.\nTurning to our balance sheet, our securities holdings have declined by nearly $1.5 trillion\nsince the Committee began reducing our portfolio. At this meeting, we discussed issues related\nto slowing the pace of decline in our securities holdings. While we did not make any decisions\ntoday on this, the general sense of the Committee is that it will be appropriate to slow the pace of\nrunoff fairly soon, consistent with the plans we previously issued. The decision to slow the pace\nof runoff does not mean that our balance sheet will ultimately shrink by less than it would\notherwise but rather allows us to approach that ultimate level more gradually. In particular,\nslowing the pace of runoff will help ensure a smooth transition, reducing the possibility that\nmoney markets experience stress and thereby facilitating the ongoing decline in our securities\nholdings consistent with reaching the appropriate level of ample reserves.\nWe remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to\nkeeping our longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Restoring price stability is\nessential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and price stability over the long\nterm.\nTo conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and\nbusinesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We, at the\nFed, will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.\nThank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve.\nPage 4 of 24\nMarch 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Mr. Chairman, the projections show\nsomewhat higher core inflation. They also show somewhat stronger growth. What should we\ninfer from this notion that, on average, rates were kept the same this year, but inflation is higher\nand growth is higher. Does it mean more tolerance for higher inflation and less of a willingness\nto slow the economy to achieve that target?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, it doesn’t—no, it doesn’t mean that. What it means is that, you\nknow, we’ve seen incoming—as I pointed out in my opening remarks, we did mark up our\ngrowth forecast and so have many other forecasters, so the economy is performing, performing\nwell. And the inflation data came in a little bit higher is a separate matter, and I think that caused\npeople to write up their inflation. But nonetheless, we continue to make good progress on\nbringing inflation down. And so—\nSTEVE LIESMAN. When you—just to follow up: When you say that you’re willing to\neither maintain the rate for longer, is—what is the tolerance of the Federal Reserve for inflation\ncoming in above its 2 percent target?\nCHAIR POWELL. We’re strongly committed to bringing inflation down to 2 percent\nover time. That is—that is our goal, and we will achieve that goal. Markets believe we will\nachieve that goal. And they should believe that, because that’s what—that’s what will happen\nover time. But we stress “over time.” And so I think we’re, we’re making projections that do\nshow that happening. And we’re committed to that outcome, and we will bring it about.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Rachel.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Hi, Chair Powell. Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. Thanks\nfor taking our questions. You and others have been saying that relief on housing inflation is\nPage 5 of 24\nMarch 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ncoming, but it still hasn’t shown up meaningfully in the CPI or the PCE. Does that challenge\nyour assumption about when the shift will finally break through, since it hasn’t at that point?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think there’s some confidence that the market rents—lower\nmarket rent increases that we’re seeing will show up in measures of housing services inflation\nover time. There’s a little bit of uncertainty about when that will happen, but there’s real\nconfidence that they will show up eventually over time. But, again, uncertainty about the exact\ntiming of that.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Okay. And will you be able to get overall inflation down to target if\nhousing doesn’t break through quickly, and does that affect the timing for eventual cuts this\nyear?\nCHAIR POWELL. We will get aggregate inflation down to 2 percent over time. We\nwill. And, and I would assume that we’ll continue to see is—we’ll see goods prices coming into\na new equilibrium where they’re going down perhaps not as quickly as they had been earlier this\nyear, where housing services inflation will come back down as, as current market rents are\nsuggesting will happen and where nonhousing services will move back down. Some\ncombination of those three things—and it may be different from the combination we had before\nthe pandemic—will be achieved and will bring inflation back down to 2 percent sustainably.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nick.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, during your\ncongressional testimony this month, you said that your test for making the first change to interest\nrates does not require you to be terribly comfortable that inflation is at 2 percent because interest\nrates are well above neutral. At the same time, you said here after the last meeting that the first\ncut is highly consequential. Can you reconcile these views for me? If rates are well above\nPage 6 of 24\nMarch 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nneutral, why would the first cut be highly consequential? Is that because you anticipate one cut\nwould be followed by one or two more along the lines of the recalibration you made in 2019,\nwhich itself was modeled on the mid-cycle adjustment of 1995?\nCHAIR POWELL. It’s more—I would put it more in the context of what I said in our—\nin my opening remarks that the risks are really two-sided here. We—we’re in a situation where,\nyou know, if we ease—if we ease too much or too soon, we could see inflation come back, and if\nwe ease too late, we could do unnecessary harm to employment and people’s working lives. And\nso, you know, we do see the risks as two-sided, so it is consequential. We want to be careful.\nAnd, fortunately, with the economy growing, with the labor market strong, and with inflation\ncoming down, we can approach that question carefully and let the data speak on that. That’s\nreally what I was thinking.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. How much of that inflation that we’ve seen so far this year do you\nchalk up to one-off calendar adjustment effects following a period of high inflation versus some\nchange in the trend we saw in the second half of last year?\nCHAIR POWELL. I want to start by being—saying I always try to be careful about\ndismissing data that we don’t like. So you need to check yourself on that, and I’ll do that. But—\nso I would say the January number, which was very high—the January CPI and PCE numbers\nwere quite high. There’s reason to think that there could be seasonal effects there. But,\nnonetheless, we don’t want to be completely dismissive of it. The February number was high,\nhigher than expectations, but we have it at currently well below 30 basis points core PCE, which\nis not terribly high. So it’s not like the January number. But I take the two of them together, and\nI think they haven’t really changed the overall story, which is that of inflation moving down\ngradually on a sometimes-bumpy road toward 2 percent. I don’t think that story has changed. I\nPage 7 of 24\nMarch 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nalso don’t think that those readings added to anyone’s confidence that we’re moving closer to, to\nthat point. But, you know, we didn’t—the last thing I’ll say is we didn’t excessively celebrate\nthe good inflation readings we got in the last seven months of last year. We didn’t take too much\nsignal out of that. What you heard us saying was that we needed to see more that we could, you\nknow—we wanted to be careful about that decision, and we’re not going to overreact, as well, to\nthese two months of data, nor are we going to ignore them.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Ann.\nANN SAPHIR. Hi, yes, Chair Powell. Could you speak a little bit more about the\ntiming? Is there enough data between now and, say, May to be able to get the kind of confidence\nthat you say you still need? Or, by June, is there enough data for you? Just give us a sense of\nyour thinking there. Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah. So we make decisions meeting by meeting. And we didn’t\nmake any decisions about future meetings today. Those are going to depend on our ongoing\nassessment of the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. So I really don’t\nhave anything for you on any specific meeting, looking forward.\nANN SAPHIR. I mean just a question of—I mean, is there even enough data for you to\nbe able to—\nCHAIR POWELL. We’ll take—you know, things can happen during an intermeeting\nperiod, if you look back—unexpected things. So I don’t want to—I wouldn’t want to dismiss\nanything. So I just would say that the Committee wants to see more data that gives us higher\nconfidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward 2 percent. I also mentioned—and\nwe don’t see this in the data right now, but if there were a significant weakening in the data,\nparticularly in the labor market, that could also be a reason for us to begin the process of\nPage 8 of 24\nMarch 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nreducing rates. Again, I don’t—there’s nothing in the data pointing at that, but those are the\nthings that we’ll be looking at, at coming meetings and—without trying to refer to any specific\nmeeting.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Chris.\nCHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Hi, Chris Rugaber, the Associated Press. Thank you. In\nthe projections, there is an increase in the neutral rate, as you know, and higher rates—¼ point\nhigher rates projected in 2025, 2026. Can you speak about why, [what] might be behind that? Is\nthere a real sense here that the economy has perhaps changed in some way that higher rates will\nbe needed in the future? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So you’re right. They’re pretty modest changes, but you’re right.\nThere was an uptick in the longer-run rate, and also there’s a 25 basis point increase in ’25 and\n’26. In terms of, are rates going to be higher in the longer run, if that’s really your question, I\ndon’t think we know that. I think it’s, it’s—we think that rates were generally low during the\npre-pandemic post–Global Financial Crisis era for reasons that are mostly, you know, important,\nslow-moving, large things like demographics and productivity and that sort of thing—things that\ndon’t move quickly. But I don’t think we know. I mean, my instinct would be that rates will not\ngo back down to the very low levels that we saw, where, all around the world, there were long-\nrun [real interest] rates that were at or below zero in some cases. I don’t see rates going back\ndown to that level. But I think there’s tremendous uncertainty around that.\nCHRIS RUGABER. Great, and just a quick follow[-up]. On the projections, you also\nhave 2.6 percent core inflation for the end of this year. It’s already at—or you mentioned it\nbeing 2.8 in February. I mean, that doesn’t sound like much disinflation at all. So are you really,\nare you still confident or—at the last press conference, you sounded pretty optimistic [that] you\nPage 9 of 24\nMarch 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nwould get more confidence at the end of this year. Is it right to say that this suggests you’re not\nseeing a lot of disinflation this year compared to what we’ve seen 2023 and so forth?\nCHAIR POWELL. I think that that higher year-end number reflects the data we’ve seen\nso far this year because you’re now—you’re now in this year. So I think that—sorry, say your\nlast part of your question again.\nCHRIS RUGABER. Are you still optimistic that you’ll get the confidence you need this\nyear?\nCHAIR POWELL. I, you know, I think, if you look at the SEP, what it says is that it is\nstill likely in most people’s view that we will achieve that confidence and that there will be rate\ncuts. But that’s really going to depend on the incoming data. It is. The other thing is, in the\nsecond half of the year, you have some pretty low readings, so it might be harder to make\nprogress as you move that 12-month window forward. Nonetheless, we’re looking for data that\nconfirm the kind of low readings that we had last year and give us a higher degree of confidence\nthat what we saw was really inflation moving sustainably down to 2 percent—toward 2 percent.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Jeanna Smialek, the New York Times. Thank you for taking our\nquestions. Per your comment to Ann that a weakening in the labor market would be a reason to\npotentially cut rates or at least a consideration in making a rate cut, would continued strength in\nthe labor market be a reason to hold off on rate cuts? And just in general, if labor supply\ncontinued to rebound in 2024, the way it did in 2023, what would stronger hiring and possibly\nstronger growth mean for the path forward on policy?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah. So, so, if what we’re getting is a lot of supply and a lot of\ndemand, and that supply is actually feeding demand because workers are getting paid and they’re\nspending and that’s, you know—what you would have is potentially kind of what you had last\nPage 10 of 24\nMarch 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nyear, which is a bigger economy where inflationary pressures are not increasing. In fact, they\nwere decreasing. So you can have that if you have a continued supply-side activity that we had\nlast year with—both with supply chains and also with, with growth in the size of the labor force.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. But—so strong hiring in and of itself would not be a reason to\nhold off on rate cuts?\nCHAIR POWELL. No, not all by itself. No. I mean, we saw—you saw last year very\nstrong hiring and inflation coming down quickly. We now have a better sense that a big part of\nthat was supply-side healing, particularly with, with growth in the labor force. So, in and of\nitself, strong job growth is not a reason, you know, for us to be concerned about inflation.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Neil.\nNEIL IRWIN. Hi, Chair Powell. Neil Irwin with Axios. How do you assess the state of\nfinancial conditions right now, and particularly—in particular, do you view the kind of easing in\nfinancial conditions since the fall as consistent and compatible with what you’re trying to\nachieve on the inflation mandate?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we think—there are many different financial conditions\nindicators, and you can kind of, you know, see different answers to that question. But,\nultimately, we do think that financial conditions are weighing on economic activity, and we think\nyou see that in—a great place to see it is in the labor market, where you’ve seen demand cooling\noff a little bit from the extremely high levels. And there I would point to job openings, quits,\nsurveys, the hiring rate. Things like that are really demand. There are also supply-side things\nhappening, but I think those are demand-side things happening. You know, we saw—that’s been\na question for a while. We did see progress on inflation last year—significant progress, despite\nfinancial conditions sometimes being tighter, sometimes looser.\nPage 11 of 24\nMarch 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMICHELLE SMITH. Mike.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee with Bloomberg Radio and Television. Can you\ngive us more color on how the Committee is thinking about inflation dynamics now? What\nwe’ve seen at the beginning of the year, are they more one-off increases that will fade, or is there\nmore of a secular turn with goods prices rising again and service prices staying sticky? And also\nhousing prices have been sort of the Godot of this cycle, in that you keep expecting them to go\ndown, and they don’t. How does the Committee see this playing out forward, since you’ve\nraised your inflation forecast?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I see the Committee looking at the two months of data and asking\nthe same question you’re asking and saying we’re just going to have to see what the data show.\nAs I mentioned, you can look at January, which is a very high reading and you can—and I think\nmany people did see the possibility of seasonal adjustment problems there. But, again, you don’t\nwant to—you’ve got to be careful about dismissing the parts of the data that you don’t like. So\nthen February wasn’t, wasn’t as high, but it was higher. So the question is, what are we going to\nsee? You know, we tend to see a little bit stronger—this is in the data—a little bit stronger\ninflation in the first half of the year, a little bit less strong later in the year. We’re going to—\nwe’re going to let the data show. I don’t think we really know whether this is a bump on the\nroad or something more. We’ll have to find out. In the meantime, the economy is strong, the\nlabor market is strong, inflation has come way down, and that gives us the ability to approach\nthis question carefully and feel more confident that inflation is moving down sustainably at\n2 percent when we take that step to begin dialing back our restrictive policy.\nPage 12 of 24\nMarch 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Well, you’ve talked about the desire to have confidence that\ninflation is continually moving down. Have the recent numbers we’ve gotten for inflation data\ndented that confidence at all?\nCHAIR POWELL. It certainly hasn’t improved our confidence—it hasn’t raised\nanyone’s confidence. But I would say that the story is really essentially the same and that is of\ninflation coming down gradually toward 2 percent on a sometimes-bumpy path, as I mentioned.\nI think that’s what you still see. We’ve got nine months of 2½ percent inflation now, and we’ve\nhad two months of kind of bumpy inflation. We were saying that we’ll—it’s going to be a\nbumpy ride. We consistently said that. Now here are some bumps, and the question is, are they\nmore than bumps? And we just don’t—we can’t know that. That’s why we are approaching this\nquestion carefully. It is very important for everyone that we serve that we do get inflation\nsustainably down. And I think the historical record, it’s—every situation is different, but the\nhistorical record is that you need to approach that question carefully and try to get it right the\nfirst time and not have to come back and raise rates again perhaps if you cut inappropriately—\nprematurely.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Go to Edward.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Edward Lawrence with FOX\nBusiness. I wanted to ask you, you received a letter from—well, the Federal Reserve is an\nindependent body, understanding Congress has oversight over that. You received a letter from\nSenators Elizabeth Warren and Sheldon Whitehouse that said—calling on you to lower interest\nrates—to cut interest rates because this has “the potential that it may remain too high for too\nlong, has halted advances in deploying renewable energy technologies and delayed significant\nclimate and economic benefits from these projects.” So has higher interest rates caused that?\nPage 13 of 24\nMarch 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. Have they—well, first of all, I respect our—you know, in our system\nof government, it is Congress that has oversight responsibility over the Fed. We place a\ntremendous amount of importance on our engagements with Congress and always treat them\nwith great respect. In this case, I would say, those are, you know—our mandate is for maximum\nemployment and price stability and the other things that we do, and that’s what we’re trying to\naccomplish. We’re trying to do that in a way that sustains the strong growth we’re seeing, the\nstrong labor market we’re seeing, but allows us to make further progress with inflation. That’s\nhow we can best serve the public and leave the other issues, which in many cases are incredibly\nimportant, such as those you mentioned, leave those to the people who have responsibility for\nthose.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. There was another letter from two dozen lawmakers saying\nthat the higher rates are squeezing the working people. How do these letters affect what you\nguys are doing, policy-wise?\nCHAIR POWELL. We receive these letters with respect, and we write careful responses\nand address concerns. We listen, again, because we’re talking to the people who, in our system\nof government, have oversight over our activity. So that’s—but at the end of the day, we take\nthat on board, but we have to make our judgments, and we have to “stick to our knitting”—\nwhich is maximum employment, price stability, supervise and regulate the banks, work on the\npayment system: the things that we do.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Claire.\nCLAIRE JONES. Thank you. Claire Jones, Financial Times. Thanks a lot for the\nopportunity to ask a question. As Chair of the FOMC, would you want to see unanimity on the\nPage 14 of 24\nMarch 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCommittee or something close to it, meaning no more than one dissent, before you begin cutting\nrates? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. We’re a very consensus-oriented organization, and we do try to\nachieve consensus and, ideally, unanimity. People do dissent. It’s something that happens. Life\ngoes on, and it’s not a problem. We’ve always had dissents. But—and so I—you know, you\nrespect thoughtful dissents very much. It’s like, you may not agree with some arguments, but\nyou really want to understand them. So you may read a book that takes a position that you have\nlong opposed, just to understand [the position of] that book. So I treat dissents with real respect\nas well.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Simon.\nSIMON RABINOVITCH. Simon Rabinovitch with the Economist. Can you hear me?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes.\nSIMON RABINOVITCH. Okay. Great. Obviously, inflation is some ways away from\ntarget. Unemployment, though, if you look at the projection for the full year of 4.0 percent, in\nFebruary, we were already at 3.9 percent, so quite close to the median projection. Are you\nconcerned at all that—notwithstanding the very strong jobs growth—that in fact there may be\nsome cracks appearing in the employment market? You talked about a significant deterioration\nin the labor market being a condition for easing rates. What would constitute that in your books?\nThank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So we, of course, monitor—it’s one of our two goal variables. We all\nmonitor the labor market very, very carefully. And I don’t see those cracks today. And I, you\nknow—we follow all the possible stories that are out there about, about there being cracks, but\nthe overall picture really is a strong labor market. The extreme imbalances that we saw in the\nPage 15 of 24\nMarch 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nearly parts of the pandemic recovery have mostly been resolved. You’re seeing high job growth.\nYou’re seeing big increases in supply. You’re seeing strong wage growth, but wage growth is\ngradually moderating down to more sustainable levels. In many, many respects, the things are\nreturning more to their state in 2019, which we can think of as normal for this purpose. That’s\njob openings and quits. And surveys of workers and businesses are always interesting on this:\nYou know, how tight is the—how easy is it to find a job? How hard is it—how easy it is to find\na worker? Those have both—those surveys have both come down.\nSo the labor market is—it’s in good shape. You know, you do see things like the low—\nthe low hiring rate, and people have made the argument that if, if layoffs were to increase, that\nwould—that would mean that the net would be fairly quick increases in unemployment. So\nthat’s something we’re watching, but we’re not seeing it. Of course, initial claims are very, very\nlow and, if anything, have tracked down a little bit. So—watching it carefully. Don’t see it.\nAnd when I say something—I, I use the term “unexpected” weakening of the labor market. So,\nyou know, we do expect the unemployment rate to—the forecast is that it would move up, I\nthink, closer to what we see as the longer-run sustainable level. That’s just—that’s just people’s\nforecast, individual forecasts. But we’re talking about something that’s unexpected. That’s\nwhere I’ll leave it, though.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve.\nSTEVE MATTHEWS. Steve Matthews with Bloomberg. You mentioned at the\nbeginning of the press conference that the Committee thought it might be appropriate to slow the\npace of asset runoff fairly soon. I’m wondering is—when you say fairly soon, does that mean\nthat the Committee would meet about this again in May and a decision could be reached that\nsoon? And I was wondering if you could also just describe the scope of what the Committee is\nPage 16 of 24\nMarch 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ndiscussing here. You’re at $95 billion of caps right now. Would that be cut about in half or\nsomething in that nature? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So that is what we’re discussing essentially is—and we’re not\ndiscussing all the other many other balance sheet issues. We will discuss those in due course.\nBut what we’re really looking at is slowing the pace of runoff. There isn't much runoff among\nMBS—in MBS right now, but there is in Treasuries. And we’re talking about going to a lower\npace. I don’t want to give you a specific number because we haven’t made a—haven’t had an\nagreement or decision, but that’s the idea. And that’s what we’re looking at.\nIn terms of the timing, I said fairly soon. I wouldn’t want to try to be more specific than\nthat, but you get the idea. The idea is—and this is in our longer-run plans—that we may actually\nbe able to get to a lower level, because we would avoid the kind of frictions that can happen.\nLiquidity is not evenly distributed in a system. And there can be times when, in the aggregate,\nreserves are ample or even abundant, but not in every part. And those parts where they’re not\nample, there can be stress, and that can cause you to prematurely stop the process to avoid the\nstress. And then it would be very hard to restart, we think. So something like that happened in\n’19 perhaps. So that’s what we’re doing. We’re looking at what would be a good time and what\nwould be a good structure, and “fairly soon” is words that we use to mean fairly soon.\nSTEVE MATTHEWS. And will there be a discussion about returning to an all-\nTreasuries balance sheet at some point?\nCHAIR POWELL. So that—our, our longer-run goal is to return to a balance sheet that\nis mostly Treasuries. I do expect that, once we’re through this, we’ll come back to the other\nissues about the composition and the maturity and revisit those issues, but it’s, you know, not\nPage 17 of 24\nMarch 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nurgent right now. We want to get this, this decision made first and then we can, when the time is\nright, come back to the other issues.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico. Also on the balance sheet, you\nknow, can you talk a little bit about how the outlook for the banking sector might impact your\nbalance sheet plans? Do you worry that, as deposits start to shrink, that we could see more\nturbulence?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, we’ll be watching carefully. But one of the reasons\nwe’re slowing down—we will soon enough, fairly soon I should say, slow down—is that we\nwant to avoid any, any kind of that turbulence. I wasn’t thinking particularly about the banking-\nsector turbulence, but we—and we had some indicators the last time. This is our second time in\ndoing this, and I think we’re going to be paying a lot of attention to the things that started to\nhappen and that foreshadowed what eventually happened at the end of that tightening cycle\nwhere we wound up in a short[-of-]reserves situation. And we don’t want to do that again. And\nI think now we have a better sense of what are the indicators. It isn’t—it wasn’t so much in the\nbanking system as it was around, for example, where federal funds are trading relative to the\nadministered rates and where secured rates are relative to the administered rates. Those sorts of\nthings. We will always be watching the banking system for similar signs, though.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Well, is it also because you’re not sure exactly how the reserve\nsupply will react once the overnight reverse repo facility drops near—at zero?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, I think we broadly think that, once [take-up at] the overnight\n[reverse] repo [facility] stabilizes, either at zero or close to zero, that, as the balance sheet\nPage 18 of 24\nMarch 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nshrinks, we should expect that reserves will decline pretty close to dollar-for-dollar with that.\nThat’s what we think.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Jean.\nJEAN YUNG. Hi Chair Powell. Jean Yung with MNI Market News. I wanted to ask\nalso about the balance sheet. Will you—you said that starting the taper sooner could get you to a\nsmaller balance sheet size. Does that mean you don’t have to make a decision on when to end\nQT at this point? And will you be setting up the process for deciding that sooner, or will you\nwait until we’re close to the end?\nCHAIR POWELL. So it’s sort of ironic that, by going slower, you can get farther. But\nthat’s the idea. The idea is that, with a smoother transition, you won’t—you’ll run much less risk\nof kind of liquidity problems, which can grow into shocks, and which can cause you to stop the\nprocess prematurely. So that’s—in terms of how it ends, we’re going to be monitoring carefully\nmoney market conditions and asking ourselves whether they—what they’re telling us about\nreserves. Are they—right now, we would characterize them as “abundant,” and what we’re\naiming for is “ample” and, you know, which is a little bit less than abundant. So there isn’t a—\nyou know, there’s not a dollar amount or a percent of GDP or anything like that where we think\nwe have a really pretty clear understanding of that. We’re going to be looking at what these—\nwhat’s happening in money markets, in particular—a bunch of different indicators, including the\nones I mentioned, to tell us when we’re getting close. Then, though, you reach a point ultimately\nwhere you stop allowing the balance sheet to run off and you—but then, from that point, there’s\nanother period in which nonreserves—nonreserve liabilities grow organically, like currency, and\nthat also shrinks the reserves at a very slow pace. So you have a, you know, a slower pace of\nrunoff, which we’ll have fairly soon. Then you have another time where you effectively hold the\nPage 19 of 24\nMarch 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nbalance sheet constant and allow nonreserve liabilities to expand. And then that ultimately\nbrings you, ideally, in for—brings it into a nice, easy landing at a level that is above—you know,\nabove what we think the lowest possible ample number would be. We’re not trying for that. We\nwant to have a cushion, a buffer, because we know that demand for reserves can be very volatile.\nAnd we don’t want to, again, find ourselves in a situation where there aren’t reserves, and we\nhave to turn around and buy assets and put reserves back in the banking system the way we did\nin 2019 and ’20.\nMICHELLE SMITH: Nancy.\nNANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Hi, Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace. Chair\nPowell, you said you’re waiting to become more confident that inflation’s getting to your\n2 percent goal before you cut rates. Can you just sum up more specifically what data you’re\nlooking at that would give you that confidence?\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So we’re—most importantly, we’re looking at the incoming\ninflation data and the contents of it and what they’re telling us, so that’ll be—and also the\nvarious components—so obviously that’s what we want. We want more confidence that\ninflation is coming down sustainably toward 2 percent. And, I mean, of course we’ll also be\nlooking at all the other things that are happening in the economy. We’ll look at the totality of the\ndata, including everything essentially as we make that assessment. But the most important thing\nwill be the inflation data coming in.\nNANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Well, are there things that you would give more\nweight to, like wages?\nCHAIR POWELL. Wages is one thing. We don’t—our target is not wages. It’s really\ninflation. But we would look to the fact that wages are still coming in very strong. But, but\nPage 20 of 24\nMarch 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthey’ve been—wage increases, that’s to say—wage increases have been quite strong, but they’re,\nthey’re gradually coming down to levels that are more sustainable over time. And that’s what\nwe want. We don’t think that—the inflation was not originally caused—we think, I don’t think,\nby mostly by wages. That wasn’t really the story. But we do think that, to get inflation back\ndown to 2 percent sustainably, we’d like to see, you know, continuing gradual movement of\nwage increases at still high levels but back down to levels that are more sustainable over time.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Greg.\nGREG ROBB. Thank you. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. Chair Powell, could you say\nat this meeting whether there were more officials who wanted to be careful and go slower than—\nabout rates—than there were at the last meeting? Was there—was there that sense of maybe it’s\nsmart to wait? Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. I guess I’d put it this way: The—if you look at the incoming\ninflation data that we’ve had for January and February, I think very broadly that suggests that we\nwere right to wait until we’re more confident. So I think, I think—I didn’t hear anyone\ndismissing it as not information that we should look at or anything like that. So I think, generally\nspeaking, it does go in the direction of saying, yes, it’s appropriate for us to be careful as we\napproach this question.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Brendan.\nBRENDAN PEDERSEN. Thanks Chair Powell. Brendan Pedersen with Punchbowl\nNews. I wanted to ask you about central bank digital currency stuff. We’ve been hearing a lot\nfrom Republicans in Congress about what the Fed is or isn’t doing in a digital dollar, but I know\nyou have said to Congress that you’re going to wait for approval before the Fed does anything—\nlaunches anything. But folks like House Majority Whip Tom Emmer have said that the Fed is\nPage 21 of 24\nMarch 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\neither actively researching or hiring personnel to study the implications of the CBDC. Can you\ngive us any clarity on what the Fed is doing right now on a digital dollar?\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So I think we’ve been pretty transparent on this, but I will—\nI’ll try harder. So we are not getting ready to—we haven’t proposed—we haven’t come to a\nconclusion that we should propose, or anything like that, that Congress consider legislation to\nauthorize a digital dollar. And it would take legislation by Congress signed by the President to\ngive us the ability to do what we think of as a CBDC, which is really a retail CBDC with the\npublic. So we’re just a long, long way from that. What we are doing, and I think what every\nmajor central bank is doing, is we’re trying to stay in the frontiers of what’s going on in digital\nfinance, and it has many, many different areas. It has applications in wholesale finance, in the\npayment system, and so we need—to serve the public—these issues have become very front\nburner in the last five or six years—we need to be knowledgeable about all that. So we actually\ndo have people trying to understand things that are—but it’s wrong to say that we’re working on\na CBDC and that we’ve secretly got a lab here where we’ve got one, and we’re just going to\nspring it on Congress at the right moment. We don’t. I haven’t at all, in my own mind, made a\ndecision that I think this is something the U.S. should be doing. I just think it’s something we\nneed to be—we need to understand. We do have people who are keeping up with that, as part of\nthe broader payments landscape. That’s, that’s how I would characterize it.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Mark.\nMARK HAMRICK. Thank you. It’s Mark Hamrick with Bankrate. Mr. Chairman,\nApril 27 will mark the 13th anniversary since a Fed Chairman began holding regular news\nconferences. How important is that higher transparency been in your view, both for the proper\nPage 22 of 24\nMarch 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nfunctioning of the central bank and also in accomplishing your mission? And is there more that\nyou and your colleagues can do on the transparency front? And what might that look like?\nCHAIR POWELL. I generally think—I mean, this movement actually started 30 years\nago—30 years ago, when some academics posited that a more transparent central bank, if the\npublic understands your reaction function, the markets will do your work for you. They’ll react\nto the data. And so it all happens that way and so there’s been a march toward greater and\ngreater transparency. And that—certainly Chairman Bernanke advanced that, Chairman\nGreenspan did, Chair Yellen did, and I. You know, so we went from four press conferences a\nyear to eight, so now every meeting really is “live” now. I think that’s a good innovation. I\nwouldn’t want to turn it back.\nWe also have done a bunch of other things. You know, we have an annual supervision\nreport, Financial Stability Report. I mean, there’s a long list of things that we’ve done. I think\nyou—I mean, nothing comes to mind as really desperately in need of doing at this moment.\nWe’re very transparent. We have no shortage of FOMC participants speaking to the public\nthrough the media. And so that channel is full, I would say. So I think it’s generally broadly\nhelped and made things better. But not every day and in every way.\nMARK HAMRICK. Well, to follow up: Has there ever been a day where you wanted to\nput that genie back in the bottle somewhat?\nCHAIR POWELL. Of course not. [Laughter]\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Jennifer, for the last question.\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. Thank you, Chair Powell. Jennifer Schonberger with\nYahoo Finance. Not to harp too much more on confidence and inflation, but you did say earlier\nin this press conference that the recent inflation data hasn’t raised anyone’s confidence. But\nPage 23 of 24\nMarch 20, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nwhen you testified before the Senate a couple weeks ago, you told lawmakers that you are “not\nfar from receiving the confidence needed on inflation to begin cutting rates.” So are you still of\nthat belief or not? What are we to take by those words, “not far?”\nCHAIR POWELL. So let me say my main message at that—in those two days of\nhearings was really that the Committee needs to see more evidence to build our confidence that\ninflation is moving down sustainably toward our 2 percent goal, and we don’t expect that it will\nbe appropriate to begin to reduce rates until we’re more confident that that is the case. I said that\nany number of times, so those were kind of the main part of the message. We repeated that\ntoday in our statement. I also—to the language you mentioned, I, I really pointed out that we\nhad made significant progress over the past year, and what we’re looking for now is confirmation\nthat that progress will continue. We had a series of inflation readings over the second half of last\nyear that were really much lower. We didn’t overreact, as I mentioned. But that’s what I had in\nmind.\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. But given that you said that PCE for February,\n2.8 percent the estimate, and that we have been seeing PCE—core PCE coming down by a tenth\nof a percent every month, I mean, wouldn’t you be at about 2.4 percent this summer, June, July,\nto a point where you could cut then?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, we’ll just have to see how the data come in. We would, of\ncourse, love to get great inflation data. We got really good inflation data on the second—in the\nsecond part of last year. Again, we didn’t overreact to it. We said we needed to see more, and\nwe said it would be bumpy. And now we have January and February, which I’ve talked about a\ncouple of times. So, you know, we’re looking for more good data, and we would certainly\nwelcome it. Thank you.\nPage 24 of 24"

    "press_conf": "May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nTranscript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference\nMay 1, 2024\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on\nour dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.\nThe economy has made considerable progress toward our dual-mandate objectives. Inflation has\neased substantially over the past year, while the labor market has remained strong. And that’s\nvery good news. But inflation is still too high, further progress in bringing it down is not\nassured, and the path forward is uncertain. We are fully committed to returning inflation to our\n2 percent goal. Restoring price stability is essential to achieve a sustainably strong labor market\nthat benefits all.\nToday, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to\nreduce our securities holdings, though at a slower pace. Our restrictive stance of monetary\npolicy has been putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation, and the risks to\nachieving our employment and inflation goals have moved toward better balance over the past\nyear. However, in recent months, inflation has shown a lack of further progress toward our\n2 percent objective, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks. I’ll have more to say about\nmonetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.\nRecent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace.\nAlthough GDP growth moderated from 3.4 percent in the fourth quarter of last year to\n1.6 percent in the first quarter, private domestic final purchases—which excludes inventory\ninvestment, government spending and net exports, and usually sends a clearer signal on\nunderlying demand—was 3.1 percent in the first quarter, as strong as the second half of 2023.\nConsumer spending has been robust over the past several quarters, even as high interest rates\nPage 1 of 26\nMay 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nhave weighed on housing and equipment investment. Improving supply conditions have\nsupported resilient demand and the strong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year.\nThe labor market remains relatively tight, but supply and demand conditions have come\ninto better balance. Payroll job gains averaged 276,000 jobs per month in the first quarter, while\nthe unemployment rate remains low at 3.8 percent. Strong job creation over the past year has\nbeen accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers, reflecting increases in participation\namong individuals aged 25 to 54 years and a continued strong pace of immigration. Nominal\nwage growth has eased over the past year and the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, but labor\ndemand still exceeds the supply of available workers.\nInflation has eased notably over the past year but remains above our longer-run goal of\n2 percent. Total PCE prices rose 2.7 percent over the 12 months ending in March; excluding the\nvolatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent. The inflation data\nreceived so far this year have been higher than expected. Although some measures of short-term\ninflation expectations have increased in recent months, longer-term inflation expectations appear\nto remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and\nforecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.\nThe Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware\nthat high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for\nthose least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We\nare strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.\nThe Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal\nfunds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities\nPage 2 of 26\nMay 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nholdings, though at a slower pace. Over the past year, as labor market tightness has eased and\ninflation has declined, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals have moved\ntoward better balance. The economic outlook is uncertain, however, and we remain highly\nattentive to inflation risks.\nWe’ve stated that we do not expect that it will be appropriate to reduce the target range\nfor the federal funds rate until we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving\nsustainably toward 2 percent. So far this year, the data have not given us that greater confidence.\nIn particular, and as I noted earlier, readings on inflation have come in above expectations. It is\nlikely that gaining such greater confidence will take longer than previously expected. We are\nprepared to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for as long as appropriate.\nWe’re also prepared to respond to an unexpected weakening in the labor market.\nWe know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of\nthe progress we’ve seen on inflation. At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too\nlittle could unduly weaken economic activity and employment. In considering any adjustments\nto the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data,\nthe evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks\nand uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate. We will continue to\nmake decisions meeting by meeting.\nTurning to our balance sheet: The Committee decided at today’s meeting to slow the\npace of decline in our securities holdings, consistent with the plans we released previously.\nSpecifically, the cap on Treasury redemptions will be lowered from the current $60 billion per\nmonth to $25 billion per month as of June 1. Consistent with the Committee’s intention to hold\nprimarily Treasury securities in the longer run, we’re leaving the cap on agency securities\nPage 3 of 26\nMay 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nunchanged per month, and we will reinvest any proceeds in excess of this cap in Treasury\nsecurities. With principal payments on agency securities currently running at about $15 billion\nper month, total portfolio runoff will amount to roughly $40 billion per month. The decision to\nslow the pace of runoff does not mean that our balance sheet will ultimately shrink by less than it\nwould otherwise but rather allows us to approach its ultimate level more gradually. In particular,\nslowing the pace of runoff will help ensure a smooth transition, reducing the possibility that\nmoney markets experience stress and thereby facilitating the ongoing decline in our securities\nholdings that are consistent with reaching the appropriate level of ample reserves.\nWe remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to\nkeeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Restoring price stability is essential to\nset the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.\nTo conclude: We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and\nbusinesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We, at the\nFed, will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.\nThank you. I look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Howard.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thank you. Howard Schneider with Reuters. A question and\nfollow-up if I could, do you consider the current policy rate still—are you confident that it’s\nsufficiently restrictive to get inflation back to 2 percent?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I do think the evidence shows, you know, pretty clearly that\npolicy is restrictive and is weighing on demand, and there are a few places I would point to for\nthat. You can start with the labor market. So demand is still strong—the demand side of the\nlabor market, in particular—but it’s cooled from its extremely high level of a couple years ago,\nPage 4 of 26\nMay 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nand you see that in job openings. You saw it—more evidence of that today in the JOLTS report,\nas you’ll know. It’s still higher than pre-pandemic. But it has been coming down both in the\nIndeed report and the JOLTS report. That’s, that’s demand cooling. The same is true of quits\nand hiring rates, which have essentially normalized. I also look at the—we look at surveys of\nworkers and—pardon me—surveys of workers and businesses, and [they] ask workers, “Are jobs\nplentiful?” and ask businesses, “Are workers plentiful? Is it easy to find workers?” And you’ve\nseen that the answers to those have come back down to pre-pandemic levels. You also see in\ninterest-sensitive spending, like housing and investment—you also see that higher interest rates\nare weighing on those activities. So I do think it’s clear that, that policy is restrictive.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Sufficiently restrictive, I guess.\nCHAIR POWELL. So I would say that we believe it is restrictive, and we believe [that]\nover time it will be sufficiently restrictive. That will be a question that, that the data will have to\nanswer.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. So as a follow-up, if inflation continues running roughly\nsideways as it has been, the job market stays reasonably strong, unemployment low, and\nexpectations are anchored and maintained, would you disrupt that for—\nCHAIR POWELL. Expectations are not anchored?\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Are anchored.\nCHAIR POWELL. Are anchored.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Stable, roughly. Would you disrupt that for the last half point\non PCE?\nPage 5 of 26\nMay 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, I don’t want to get into complicated hypotheticals. But I\nwould say that, you know, we’re committed to retaining our current restrictive stance of policy\nfor as long as is appropriate. And we’ll do that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jeanna.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Thanks for taking our questions, Chair Powell. I wonder—you\nknow, obviously Michelle Bowman has been saying that there is a risk that rates may need to\nincrease further, although it’s not her baseline outlook. I wonder if you see that as a risk as well,\nand, if so, what change in conditions would merit considering raising rates at this point?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think it’s unlikely that the next policy rate move will be a hike.\nI’d say it’s unlikely. You know, our policy focus is really what I just mentioned, which is—\nwhich is how long to keep policy restrictive. You ask, what would it take? You know, I think\nwe’d need to see persuasive evidence that our policy stance is not sufficiently restrictive to bring\ninflation sustainably down to 2 percent over time. That’s not—that’s not what we think we’re\nseeing, as I—as I mentioned, but that’s—something like that is what it would take. We’d look at\nthe totality of the data in answer to that question. That would include inflation, inflation\nexpectations, and all the other data too.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Would that be—would that be a reacceleration in inflation?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, I think, again, the test—what I’m saying is, if we were to come\nto that conclusion that policy weren’t tight enough to achieve that, so it would be the totality of\nall the things we’d be looking at. It could be expectations. It could be a combination of things.\nBut, if we—if we reach that conclusion—and we don’t see evidence supporting that\nconclusion—that’s what it would take I think for us to take that step.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Chris.\nPage 6 of 26\nMay 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Thank you, Chris Rugaber at Associated Press. You\ndidn’t mention the idea that rates are at a peak for the cycle and didn’t mention the idea that it\nmight be appropriate to cut rates later this year as you have in previous press conferences. So\nhas the Fed sort of dropped its easing bias? Where are you standing on that?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, on—let me address cuts. So, obviously, our decisions that we\nmake on our policy rate are going to depend on the incoming data, how the outlook is evolving,\nand the balance of risks, as always. And we’ll look at the totality of the data. So I think, and we\nthink, that policy is well positioned to address different paths that the economy might take. And\nwe’ve said that we don’t think it would be appropriate to dial back our restrictive policy stance\nuntil we’ve gained greater confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward\n2 percent. So, for example, let me take a path: If we did have a path where inflation proves\nmore persistent than expected and where the labor market remains strong, but inflation is moving\nsideways and we’re not gaining greater confidence, well, that would be a case in which it could\nbe appropriate to hold off on rate cuts.\nI think there’s also other paths that the economy could take, which, which would cause us\nto want to consider rate cuts. And those would be—two of those paths would be that we do gain\ngreater confidence, as we’ve said, that inflation is moving sustainably down to 2 percent, and\nanother path could be, you know, an unexpected weakening in the labor market, for example. So\nthose are paths in which you could see us cutting rates. So I think it really will depend on the\ndata. In terms of peak rate, you know, I think, really, it’s the same question. I, I think the data\nwill have to answer that question for us.\nPage 7 of 26\nMay 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHRISTOPHER RUGABER. And could you just follow—on the path where you might\nnot cut, is that—you mentioned that would be inflation persistent—I mean, is inflation—would\nthat be the key data in making that decision, or could you expand a bit more on that? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Again, it’s, it’s—we’ve set ourselves a test that we—for us to begin\nto reduce policy restriction, we’d want to be confident that inflation is moving—you know,\nmoving sustainably down to 2 percent, and, for sure, one of the things we’d be looking at is the\nperformance of inflation. We’d also be looking at inflation expectations. We’d be looking at the\nwhole story. But clearly, incoming, incoming inflation data would be at the very heart of that\ndecision.\nCHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nick.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, to what\nextent has the easing in financial conditions since November contributed to the reacceleration in\ngrowth, and do you now expect a period of sustained tighter financial conditions will be needed\nto resume the sort of disinflation the economy saw last year?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think it’s hard to know that. I think we’ll be able to look back,\nyou know, from down the road and look back and understand it better. You know, if you look\nat—let’s look at growth. Really, what we’ve seen so far this year in the first quarter is growth\ncoming in about consistent with where it was last year. I know GDP came in lower, but you\ndon’t see an acceleration in growth. I mean, the thought would be that financial conditions\nloosened in, in, December, and that caused an uptick in activity, and that caused inflation.\nPresumably, that’s what we’re tightening in the labor market. You don’t really see that\nhappening. What you see is economic activity at a level that’s roughly the same as, as last year.\nPage 8 of 26\nMay 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nSo, you know, what’s causing this inflation? You know, we’ll, we’ll have a better sense of that\nover time. I don’t know that there’s an obvious connection there, though, with easing of\nfinancial conditions. In terms of tightening, you’re, you’re right. Rates are certainly higher now\nand have been for some time than they were before the December meeting. And they’re higher,\nand that’s tighter financial conditions. And, you know, that’s appropriate, given what inflation\nhas done in the first quarter.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. You’ve said in the past that stronger growth wouldn’t necessarily\npreclude rate cuts. I wonder, would continued strength in the labor market change your view\nabout the appropriate stance of policy if it was accompanied by signs the wage growth was\nreaccelerating?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I just want to be careful that we don’t target wage growth or the\nlabor market. And remember what we saw last year: very strong growth, a really tight labor\nmarket, and a historically fast decline in inflation. So—and that’s because we know there are\ntwo forces at work here. There’s the unwinding of the pandemic-related supply-side distortions\nand demand-side distortions, and there’s also monetary policy, you know, restrictive monetary\npolicy. So I wouldn’t rule out that something like that can continue. You know, I wouldn’t give\nup, at this point, on further things happening on the supply side either because, you know, we do\nsee that companies still report that there are supply-side issues that they’re facing. And also,\neven when the supply-side issues are solved, it should take some time for that to affect economic\nactivity and ultimately inflation. So there are still those things. So I don’t like to say that either\nstrong—either growth or, or a strong labor market, in and of itself, would automatically create\nproblems on inflation, because, of course, it didn’t do that last year.\nPage 9 of 26\nMay 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nYou ask about wages. We also don’t—we don’t target wages. We target price inflation.\nIt is one of the inputs. The point with wages is, of course, we, like everyone else, like to see high\nwages, but we also want to see them not eaten up by high inflation. And that’s really what we’re\ntrying to do, is to cool the economy and work with what’s happening on the supply side to\nbring—to bring the economy back to 2 percent inflation. Part of that will probably be having\nwage increases move down incrementally toward levels that are more sustainable.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Rachel.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Hi, Chair Powell. Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. Thanks\nfor taking our questions. You talked about needing time to gain more confidence that inflation is\nsustainably moving back down to 2 percent. It’s May now. Do you have time this year to cut\nthree times, just given the calendar?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah. I’m not really thinking of it that way. You know, the—what\nwe said is that we need to be more confident, and we’ve said—my colleagues and I today said\nthat we didn’t see progress in the first—in the first quarter. And I’ve said that it appears, then,\nthat it’s going to take longer for us to reach that point of confidence. So I don’t know how long\nit’ll take. You know, I can just say that when we get that confidence, then rate cuts will be in\nscope. And I don’t know exactly when that will be.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. And, with hindsight, are there any signs that you can look back on\nnow, looking at the reports from January or February or March, that suggested something more\nworrying than just expected bumpiness?\nCHAIR POWELL. I—you know, not really. You know, what, what—so I thought it was\nappropriate to reserve judgment until, until we had the full quarter’s data, until we saw the March\ndata. And so take a step back. What do we now see in the first quarter? We see strong economic\nPage 10 of 26\nMay 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nactivity, we see a strong labor market, and we see inflation. We see three inflation readings, and\nso I think you’re at a point there where you should take some signal. We don’t like to react to\none or two months’ data, but this is a full quarter. And I think it’s appropriate to take signal now,\nand we are taking signal. And the signal that we’re taking is that it’s likely to take longer for us\nto gain confidence that we are on a sustainable path down to 2 percent inflation. That’s the\nsignal that we’re taking now. Yeah.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Mr. Chair, if I could—Steve Liesman, CNBC. If I could follow up\non that: What particular areas were sort of temporary or blips in the inflation data in the first\nquarter? What’s the dynamic by which you expect them to work out in the coming months and\nquarters?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah. So we will—you know, we will put the thing—we have put\nthe thing under a microscope. I will say, nothing is going to come out of that that’s going to\nchange the view. I think that, in fact, we didn’t gain confidence and that it’s going to take longer\nto get that confidence—but—confidence. I just think—you know the story. What’s happened\nsince December is you’ve seen higher goods inflation than expected, and you’ve seen higher\nnonhousing services inflation than expected. And those two are working together to, to sort of be\nhigher than we had thought. And there are stories behind how that happened, and, you know,\nwe—I think—I think my expectation is that we will, over the course of this year, see inflation\nmove back down. That’s, that’s my forecast. I think my confidence in that is lower than it was\nbecause of the data that we’ve seen. So, you know, we’re looking at those things. We also\ncontinue to expect, and I continue to expect, that housing services inflation, given where market\nrents are, those will show up in measured housing services inflation over time. We believe that it\nPage 11 of 26\nMay 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nwill. It just—it looks like the lag—that there are substantial lags between when, you know,\nlower market rates turned up and—for new tenants and when it shows up for existing tenants or\nfor in-housing services.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. If I could just follow up: Is there a bit of a contradiction in the idea\nthat you are reducing quantitative tightening, which is sort of an easing, while you’re holding\nrates steady at a restrictive rate to try to slow and cool the economy and inflation? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. I wouldn’t say that. No. I mean, the active tool of monetary policy\nis, of course, the interest rates. And this is—this is a long—a plan we’ve long had in place to\nslow, really not in order to, you know, provide accommodation to the economy but to—or to be\nless restrictive to the economy. It really is to ensure that the process of shrinking the balance\nsheet down to where we want to get it is a smooth one and doesn’t wind up in—with financial\nmarket turmoil the way it did the last—the last time we did this and the only other time we’ve\never done this.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Craig.\nCRAIG TORRES. Craig Torres from Bloomberg. Two questions. First, a simple one.\nGiven the run of data since March, has the probability in your mind of no cuts this year increased\nor stayed the same? That’s the first question. Second question. Chair Powell, you joined the\nBoard in 2012, and I’m sure you remember, as I do, what the jobless recovery was like: lawyers,\naccountants, all kinds of highly qualified people who couldn’t get jobs. And given your history\nthere, I wonder if there’s an argument for being more patient with inflation here. We have strong\nproductivity growth that’s helping wages grow up—go up. We have good employment. And so\nit seems to me there’s a lot of hysteria about inflation. I agree—you know, nobody likes it, but is\nPage 12 of 26\nMay 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthere an argument for being patient and working with the economic cycle to get it down over\ntime? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So, on your first question, I don’t have a probability estimate for you.\nBut all I can say is that, you know, we’ve said that we didn’t think it would be appropriate to cut\nuntil we were more confident that inflation was moving sustainably down to 2 percent. We\ndidn’t get our confidence, in that [it] didn’t increase in the first quarter. And, in fact, what really\nhappened was we came to the view that it will take longer to get that confidence. And I think\nthere are—you know, I think it’s—the economy has been very hard for forecasters broadly to\npredict—to predict its path. But there are paths to, to not cutting, and there are paths to cutting.\nIt’s really going to depend on the data.\nIn terms of the employment mandate, to your point, if you go back a couple of years, our,\nour sort of framework document says that, when you look at the two mandate goals, and if one of\nthem is further away from goal than the other, then you focus on that one. It actually—it’s the\ntime to get back there times the, you know, times how far it is from the goal. And that was\nclearly inflation. So our focus was very much on inflation. As—and this is what we referred to\nin the statement. As inflation has come down, now to below 3 percent on a—on a 12-month\nbasis, it’s become—we’re now focusing [on] the other goal. The employment goal now comes\nback into focus. And so we are focusing on it. And, and that’s how we think about that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Claire.\nCLAIRE JONES. Claire Jones, Financial Times. Thanks a lot for the opportunity to ask\nthe questions. Just to go back to the answer before the previous one, it seemed to suggest that\nyou think the likeliest path of inflation is one that’s going to allow you to have a situation where\nrates are lower at the end of the year than they are right now. It’d be good if you could just\nPage 13 of 26\nMay 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nconfirm whether or not that’s a correct reading. And the Q1 GDP print has led to some—some to\nstart mentioning the term “stagflation” with respect to the U.S. economy. Do you or anyone else\non the FOMC think this is now a risk? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah. I’m not dealing really in likelihoods. I think there are—there\nare paths that the economy can take that would involve cuts and there are paths that wouldn’t.\nAnd I don’t have great confidence in which of those paths—I think I would say my personal\nforecast is that we will begin to see further progress on inflation this year. I don’t know that it\nwill be enough, sufficient. I don’t know that it won’t. I think we’re going to have to let the data\nlead us on that.\nIn terms of your question—your second question was stagflation. I guess I would say I\nwas around for stagflation, and it was, you know, 10 percent—10 percent unemployment. It was\nhigh single-digits inflation. Right now we have—and very slow growth—so right now we have\n3 percent growth, which is, you know, pretty solid growth I would say, by any measure, and we\nhave inflation running under 3 percent. So I don’t—I don’t really understand where that’s\ncoming from. And, in addition, I would say most forecasters, including our forecasting, was that\nlast year’s level of growth was very high—3.4 percent in, I guess, the fourth quarter, you know—\nand probably not going to be sustained and would come down. But that would be—that would\nbe our forecast. That wouldn’t be stagflation. That would still be to a very healthy level of\ngrowth. And, of course, with inflation, you know, our—we will return inflation to 2 percent, and\nthat won’t be—so I don’t see the “stag” or the “flation,” actually. [Laughter]\nMICHELLE SMITH. Michael McKee.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television. The Vice\nChair of the FOMC said recently that he’s willing to consider the idea that potential growth has\nPage 14 of 26\nMay 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nmoved up. And, of course, he’s “Mr. Potential Growth/r*.” Do you share that view, and would\nthat imply that maybe policy isn’t tight enough?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think I would take that question this way: We saw a year of\nvery high productivity growth in 2023, and we saw a year of, I think, negative productivity\ngrowth in 2022. So I think it’s hard to draw from the data. I mean, the question is, will\nproductivity run—there are two questions. One is: Will productivity run persistently above its\nlonger-run trend? I don’t think we know that. In terms of potential output, though, that’s a\nseparate question. We’ve had a—what amounts to a, a significant increase in the potential output\nof the economy that’s not about productivity. It was about having more labor, frankly, both\nthrough—in 2022, both through participation and also through immigration. So we’re very\nmuch—like other forecasters and economists—getting our arms around what that means for\npotential output this year and next year—and last year for that matter, too. So I think—in that\ncase, I think you really do have a significant increase in potential output, but you’ve also got—so\nyou’ve got more supply. But those people also come in, they work, they have jobs, they spend.\nSo you’ve also got demand. So it—there may be—it may be that you get more supply than you\nget demand at the beginning, but, ultimately, it should be neither inflationary nor disinflationary\nover, over a longer period.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. You said earlier that, at this point, you’re not really considering\nrate increases. If growth is higher, but you’re not considering rate increases, does that imply that\nyou’re more worried about causing the economy to slow too much than you are about inflation\ntaking off again?\nCHAIR POWELL. No. I think we, we believe our policy stance is in a good place and is\nappropriate to the current situation. We believe it’s restrictive, and, you know, we—our evidence\nPage 15 of 26\nMay 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nfor that, I went over earlier. You see it in the labor market. You see it in inflation-sensitive\nspending, where demand has clearly come down a lot over the past few years. And that’s, that’s\nmore from monetary policy, whereas the supply side of things that are happening are more on the\nsupply side. So that’s how I would think about it.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Edward.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Edward Lawrence from Fox\nBusiness. So GDP growth is about 2 percent. Inflation—[Un]employment is about 4 percent. It\nfeels a lot like a steady state, and we have 3 percent inflation. So if the data remains the same\nthat you’re seeing, and I know you said you don’t see a rate hike, but it stands to reason that you\nwould need a rate hike to get from 3 to 2 percent inflation. So was there any discussion about a\nrate hike in today’s meeting, and, you know, are you satisfied with 3 percent inflation for the rest\nof the year?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, of course we’re not satisfied with 3 percent inflation. “Three\npercent” can’t be in a sentence with “satisfied.” [Laughter] So we will return inflation to\n2 percent over time but over time. And we think our policy stance is, is appropriate to do that.\nSo if we were to conclude that policy is not sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation sustainably\ndown to 2 percent, then that would be what it would take for us to want to increase rates. We\ndon’t see that. We don’t see evidence for that. So that’s where we are.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Was there discussion about a rate hike at all?\nCHAIR POWELL. So the policy focus has been on—has really been on what to do\nabout, about holding the current—the current level of restriction. That’s really—that’s part of the\npolicy. That’s where the policy discussion was in the meeting.\nPage 16 of 26\nMay 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. I wanted to follow [up] on the 3 percent. Is there a time frame\nof persistent inflation that would trigger a rate hike?\nCHAIR POWELL. There isn’t any rule. You can’t look to a rule. You know, these are—\nthese are going to be judgment calls. You know, clearly restrictive monetary policy needs more\ntime to do its job. That, that is pretty clear, based on what we’re seeing. How long that will take\nand how patient we should be is going to depend on the totality of the data, how the outlook\nevolves.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi. Victoria Guida with Politico. You’ve talked about your\ncommitment to being apolitical and nonpartisan. And I was just wondering, given that it’s an\nelection year, is the bar for rate changes higher close to an election? And, similarly, is there a\nsignificant economic difference between, you know, starting to cut in, say, September versus\nDecember?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we’re, we’re always going to do what we think the right thing for\nthe economy is when we come to that consensus view that it’s the right thing to do for the\neconomy. That’s our record. That’s what we do. We’re not looking at anything else. You know,\nit’s hard enough to get the economics right here. These are difficult things, and if, if we were to\ntake on a whole, another, set of factors and use that as a new filter, it would reduce the likelihood\nwe’d actually get the economics right. So that’s how we think about it around here. And, you\nknow, we’re at peace over it. We know that we’ll do what we think is the right thing, when we\nthink it’s the right thing. And we’ll all do that. And that’s, that’s how everybody around here\nthinks. So I can’t say it enough, that we just don’t—we just don’t go down that road. If you go\ndown that road, where do you stop? And, and so we’re not on that road. We’re on the road\nPage 17 of 26\nMay 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nwhere we’re serving all the American people and making our decisions based on the data and\nhow those data affect the outlook and the balance of risks.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. And then, is there a significant difference between, you know,\nwhether you start in, say, September versus December?\nCHAIR POWELL. There’s—\nVICTORIA GUIDA. An economic difference.\nCHAIR POWELL. —a significant difference between an institution that takes into\naccount all sorts of political events and one that doesn’t. That’s where the significant difference\nis, and, you know, we’re—we just don’t do that. I mean, you can go back and read the\ntranscripts for every—this is my fourth election, fourth presidential election here. Read all the\ntranscripts, and see if anybody mentions, in any way, the pending election. It just isn’t part of\nour thinking. It’s not what we’re hired to do. If we start down that road, again, I don’t know\nhow you stop. So.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Simon.\nSIMON RABINOVITCH. Thank you, Chair Powell. Question about the labor market—\nyou’ve mentioned a few times that the labor market is normalizing. Certainly, today’s JOLTS\ndata suggested that things are kind of getting back to pre-pandemic levels. One thing that hasn’t\nnormalized is wage growth, which is still quite a bit stronger than before the pandemic. I wonder\nif you can share your analysis of, of why that’s happening. Is it a lagging indicator, or is\nsomething else going on?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think if you go back to where wages peaked—wage increases\npeaked a couple, three years ago—essentially all wage measures have come down substantially\n[when compared] to that. But they are not, not down to where they were before the pandemic.\nPage 18 of 26\nMay 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nThey’re still roughly a percentage point higher. And we’ve seen pretty consistent progress but\nnot uniformly. And you’ll note the ECI reading from Tuesday was—it was expected to be—to\nhave come down, and, essentially, it was flat year over year, you know, I think roughly. So yeah,\nI mean, it’s—that part of it is bumpy. And, again, we don’t target wage increases, but, you know,\nin the longer run, if you have—if you have wage increases running higher than productivity\nwould warrant, then, you know, there will be inflationary pressures. Employers will raise prices\nover time if that’s the case. So we’ve seen progress. It has been inconsistent, but we have seen a\nsubstantial decline overall. But we have a ways to go on that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Scott. Nancy. I’m sorry.\nNANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Hey, Chair Powell. Nancy Marshall-Genzer from\nMarketplace. You mentioned consumers, and consumers are feeling the weight of interest rates\nright now. Mortgage rates are up, as are rates for car loans, credit cards. People looking to\nborrow are very discouraged. That’s reflected in their views on the economy. What would you\nsay to them?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, the thing that hurts everybody, and particularly people in the\nlower-income brackets, is inflation. If you’re a person who’s living paycheck to paycheck, and\nsuddenly all the things you buy—the fundamentals of life—go up in price, you, you are in\ntrouble right away. And so, with those people in mind, in particular, what we’re doing is, we’re\nusing our tools to bring down inflation. It will take some time, but we will succeed. And we will\nbring inflation back down to 2 percent, and then people won’t have to worry about it again.\nThat’s what we’re doing, and we know that it’s painful and inconvenient. But the dividends will\nbe paid and will be very large. And, and everyone will share in those dividends, and we’ve made\nquite a lot of progress if you can think about it. I think core—I think headline—core PCE\nPage 19 of 26\nMay 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\n[inflation] peaked at 5.8 [percent]. Now it’s at—anyway, headline peaked at 7.1. Now it’s at 2.7.\nDon’t want to get that wrong.\nNANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. No, you don’t. Quick follow-up—are current interest\nrates really doing that much, though, to fight inflation right now for those consumers?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes. I mean, I think—I think that restrictive monetary policy is\ndoing what it’s supposed to do, and it’s—but it’s also, in this case unusually, working alongside\nand with the healing of the supply side. This, this—what was different this time was that a big\npart of the source of the inflation and the reason why we’re having this conversation is that we\nhad this supply-side kind of collapse, with shortages and bottlenecks and all that kind of thing.\nAnd so—and this was to do with the shutting down and reopening of the economy and other\nthings that, that really raised demand. So, many factors did that. So I think now you see those\ntwo things working together, the reversal of those supply and demand distortions from the\npandemic and the response to it, along with restrictive monetary policy. Those two things are\nworking to bring down inflation, and we’ve made a lot of progress. Let’s remember how far\nwe’ve come. And we have a ways to go. We’ve got work left to do, but we’re not looking at the\nvery high inflation rates that we were seeing two years ago.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Courtenay.\nCOURTENAY BROWN. Courtenay Brown from Axios. Thanks for taking our\nquestions, Chair Powell. I wanted to follow up on something you mentioned earlier on housing\ninflation. There’s kind of been this long-awaited disinflation in shelter that still hasn’t arrived.\nSo I guess two questions, how do you explain the substantial lags between some of the private-\nsector data we’re seeing and the government data, and how confident are you that rents will be\nhelpful on the inflation front in the coming months?\nPage 20 of 26\nMay 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. So, essentially, there are—there are a number of places in the\neconomy where there are just lag structures built into the inflation process, and housing is one of\nthem. So when you have—when, when someone goes to—a new person goes to rent an\napartment, that’s called market rent, and you can see market rents are barely going up at all. The\ninflation in those has been very low. But it takes—before that, they were incredibly high. They\nsort of led the, the high part. So what happens is, those market rents take years, actually, to get\nall the way into rents for tenants who are rolling over their leases. Landlords don’t tend to\ncharge as much of an increase to a rollover tenant, for whatever reason. And what that does is it\nbuilds up a sort of an unrealized portion of increases when there have been big increases. And\nwhat happens is, you know—it’s complicated, but the story is it just takes some time for that to\nget in. Now I am confident that, as long as market rents remain low, this is going to show up in\nmeasured inflation, assuming that market rents do remain low. How—what will be the exact\ntiming of it? I think we’ve learned that the lags are longer. We now think significantly longer\nthan we thought at the beginning, and so confident that it will come but not so confident in the\ntiming of it. But, yes, I expect that, that this will happen.\nCOURTENAY BROWN. Thanks.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nick Jasinski.\nNICHOLAS JASINSKI. Thank you, Chair Powell, for taking the questions. This is\nNicholas Jasinski from Barron’s Magazine. It seems that over the past three or four years,\neconomies and central banks in developed markets, at least, have been on more or less the same\ntrajectory: easing during the pandemic, fighting inflation with restrictive policy on the way out.\nIt feels like that may be ending in 2024 based on some of the economic data from Europe and the\nU.S. and Japan and statements from those central banks as well. So my question is, what, what\nPage 21 of 26\nMay 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nconsiderations or risks does a period of more divergent global economic trajectories and central\nbank policies present for the FOMC?\nCHAIR POWELL. So that—you’re right. I think that, that may happen, and, you know\nthat we all serve domestic mandates, right? So I think the difference between the United States\nand other countries that are now considering rate cuts is that they’re just not having the kind of\ngrowth we’re having. They have—their inflation is performing about like ours or maybe a little\nbetter, but they’re not experiencing the kind of growth we’re experiencing. So we actually have\nthe luxury of having strong growth and a strong labor market, very low unemployment, high job\ncreation, and all of that, and we can be patient. And we will—we’ll be careful and cautious as\nwe approach the decision to cut rates, whereas I think other jurisdictions may go before that.\nIn terms of the implications, you know, I think obviously markets see it coming. It’s\npriced in now. And so I think the markets and economies can adapt to it. And I think, you know,\nwe haven’t seen—in addition, for the emerging market economies, we haven’t seen the kind of\nturmoil that was more frequent 20 years ago, 30 years ago. And that’s, I think, partly because\nemerging market countries, many of them have much better monetary policy frameworks, much\nmore credibility on inflation. And so they’re navigating this pretty well this time.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jennifer.\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. Thank you, Chair Powell. Jennifer Schonberger with\nYahoo Finance. You sort of backed away from the notion that the economy would need to\nencounter pain for inflation to come back down. But, given the sticky inflation data in the first\nquarter, can disinflation still happen along a relatively painless path for the economy, or is some\nsoftening in the labor market and the economy likely needed to bring inflation back down?\nPage 22 of 26\nMay 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. So you’re right. I think we thought, and most people thought, there\nwould have to be probably significant dislocations somewhere in the economy, perhaps the labor\nmarket, to get inflation all the way down from the very high levels it was at at the beginning of\nthis episode. That didn’t happen. That’s a tremendous result. We’re very, of course, gratified\nand pleased that that hasn’t happened. And, if you look at the dynamics that enabled that, it\nreally was that this, the—that so much of the gain was from the unwinding of things that weren’t\nto do with monetary policy but the unwinding of the distortions to the economy, you know,\nsupply problems—supply-side problems and also some, some demand issues as well. The\nunwinding of those really helped inflation come down. Now, as I’ve said, I’m not giving up on\nthat. So I think—I think it is possible that, that those forces will still work to help us bring\ninflation down. We can’t—we can’t be guaranteed that that’s true, though. And so we’re—you\nknow, we’re trying to use our tools in a way that keeps the labor market strong, and the economy\nstrong, but also helps bring inflation back down to 2 percent sustainably. We will bring inflation\ndown to 2 percent sustainably. We hope we can do it without, you know, without significant\ndislocations in the labor market or elsewhere.\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. And speaking of dislocations in the labor market: In\nterms of cutting, you said, if there were weakness in the job market, that could be a reason to cut\nrates. So if the unemployment rate were to tick above 4 percent but inflation not back down to\nyour 2 percent target, how would you look at that? Would the unemployment rate popping back\nabove 4 percent catch your attention?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, I said “an unexpected weakening” is what I—the way I\ncharacterized it. So, you know—and I’m not going to try to define exactly what I mean by that.\nBut, you know, it would be—it would have to be meaningful and get our attention and lead us to\nPage 23 of 26\nMay 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthink that the labor market was really significantly weakening for us to want to react to it. A\ncouple of tenths in the unemployment rate would be—would probably not do that. But a\nbroader—it would be a broader thing that would—that would suggest that it would be\nappropriate to consider cutting. I think whether you decide to cut will depend on all the facts and\ncircumstances, not just that one.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Kyle.\nKYLE CAMPBELL. Chair Powell, thanks for taking the question. Kyle Campbell with\nAmerican Banker. You’ve said that broad and material changes are needed for the Basel III\nEndgame proposal, and you’ve mentioned that a re-proposal is something that’s on the table. As\nyou’ve had more time to sort of sit with the public commentary, process that, and understand the\noptions available to you, do you have a better sense of whether a re-proposal will be necessary,\nand do you have a timeline in mind for when, you know, some sort of movement will be made on\nthat front—either a re-proposal or a move to finalize?\nCHAIR POWELL. So let me—let me start by saying that the Fed is committed to, you\nknow, completing this process and carrying out Basel III Endgame in a way that’s faithful to\nBasel and also comparable to what the other large comparable jurisdictions are doing. We\nhaven’t made any decisions on, on policy or on process at all. Nothing. Nothing. No decisions\nhave been made. I’ll say again, though, if we conclude that re-proposal is appropriate, we won’t\nhesitate to insist on that.\nKYLE CAMPBELL. And then do you need to resolve issues with the capital proposal in\norder to advance other parts of the regulatory agenda, or do you expect to continue to make\nprogress on those other agenda items? Thank you.\nPage 24 of 26\nMay 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, there’s no mechanical rule in place there. But I would say\nthat the, you know, the Basel III process is by far the most important thing and really is, I think,\noccupying us at this time in terms of what’s, what’s—what we’re moving ahead with.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Mark for the last question.\nMARK HAMRICK. Thank you. Mark Hamrick with Bankrate. Mr. Chairman, what\ncan you tell us about the approach that you take with your role in the sense of trying to achieve\nconsensus, which you recently identified as a priority, while allowing for a range of views or\neven dissent? We don’t see many dissenting votes in the official statements, even when more\nspirited discussions are noted in the minutes after the fact. How do you avoid groupthink and\navoid a higher risk of a policy mistake? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think if you listen to, and you all do, listen to my 18 colleagues\non the FOMC, you’ll see that we do not lack for a diversity of voices and perspectives. We\nreally don’t. And it’s one of the great aspects of the Federal Reserve System. We have\n12 Reserve Banks around the country where they have their own economic staff, not the people\nwho work here at the Board. There are different people. You know, and so each, each Reserve\nBank has its own culture around monetary policy and its own approach and that kind of thing. It\nguarantees you a diversity of perspectives. So I think that the perspectives are very diverse.\nBut—and, in terms of—in terms of dissents, you know, we have dissents. And, you\nknow, a thoughtful dissent is a good thing, if someone really makes you think, that kind of thing.\nBut all I can say from my standpoint is I try—I listen carefully to people. I try to incorporate\ntheir thinking or do everything I can to incorporate their thinking into what we’re doing. And I\nthink many people, if they feel that’s happening, you know, that for most people most of the\nPage 25 of 26\nMay 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ntime, that’ll be enough. And—but I’m not—I mean, it’s, it’s not, you know, frowned upon or\nillegal or against the rules or anything like that. It just is the way things come out.\nAnd I mean, I think we have a very diverse group of rounded people—frankly, more\ndiverse than it used to be in many dimensions, more diverse from the obvious gender and\ndemographic ways, but also we have more people who are not Ph.D. economists. So we have\npeople from business and law and academia and things like that. So I think we actually do have\nquite a good diverse perspective. I think all of us read these stories about the lack of diversity,\nand we look around the room and say, “I don’t understand. I really don’t understand what\nthey’re talking about.” So—but I get the question, though. Thank you very much.\nPage 26 of 26"

    "press_conf": "June 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nTranscript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference\nJune 12, 2024\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on\nachieving our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of\nthe American people. Our economy has made considerable progress toward both goals over the\npast two years. The labor market has come into better balance, with continued strong job gains\nand a low unemployment rate. Inflation has eased substantially from a peak of 7 percent to\n2.7 percent but is still too high. We are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent\ngoal in support of a strong economy that benefits everyone.\nToday, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to\nreduce our securities holdings. We are maintaining our restrictive stance of monetary policy in\norder to keep demand in line with supply and reduce inflationary pressures. I’ll have more to say\nabout monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.\nRecent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace.\nAlthough GDP growth moderated from 3.4 percent in the fourth quarter of last year to\n1.3 percent in the first quarter, private domestic final purchases—which excludes inventory\ninvestment, government spending, and net exports and usually sends a clearer signal on\nunderlying demand—grew at 2.8 percent in the first quarter, nearly as strong as the second half\nof 2023. Growth of consumer spending has slowed from last year’s robust pace but remains\nsolid. And investment in equipment and intangibles has picked up from its anemic pace last\nyear. Improving supply conditions have supported resilient demand and the strong performance\nof the U.S. economy over the past year. In our Summary of Economic Projections, Committee\nparticipants generally expect GDP growth to slow from last year’s pace, with a median\nprojection of 2.1 percent this year and 2.0 percent over the next two years.\nPage 1 of 27\nJune 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nIn the labor market, supply and demand conditions have come into better balance.\nPayroll job gains averaged 218,000 jobs per month in April and May, a pace that is still strong\nbut a bit below that seen in the first quarter. The unemployment rate ticked up but remains low\nat 4 percent. Strong job creation over the past couple of years has been accompanied by an\nincrease in the supply of workers, reflecting increases in participation among individuals aged 25\nto 54 years and a continued strong pace of immigration. Nominal wage growth has eased over\nthe past year, and the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed. Overall, a broad set of indicators\nsuggests that conditions in the labor market have returned to about where they stood on the eve\nof the pandemic—relatively tight but not overheated. FOMC participants expect labor market\nstrength to continue. The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP is 4.0 percent at the\nend of this year and 4.2 percent at the end of next year.\nInflation has eased notably over the past two years but remains above our longer-run goal\nof 2 percent. Total PCE prices rose 2.7 percent over the 12 months ending in April; excluding\nthe volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent. The consumer price\nindex—which came out this morning and tends to run higher than the PCE, PCE price index—\nrose 3.3 percent over the 12 months ending in May, and the core CPI rose 3.4 percent. The\ninflation data received earlier this year were higher than expected, though more recent monthly\nreadings have eased somewhat. Longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well\nanchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households and businesses and forecasters,\nas well as measures from financial markets. The median projection in the SEP for total PCE\ninflation is 2.6 percent this year, 2.3 percent next year, and 2.0 percent in 2026.\nMy colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as\nit erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials\nPage 2 of 27\nJune 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nlike food, housing, and transportation. Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual\nmandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. In\nsupport of these goals, the Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for\nthe federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue reducing our securities holdings. As\nlabor market tightness has eased and inflation has declined over the past year, the risks to\nachieving our employment and inflation goals have moved toward better balance. The economic\noutlook is uncertain, however, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks.\nWe’ve stated that we do not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range for the\nfederal funds rate until we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably\ntoward 2 percent. So far this year, the data have not given us that greater confidence. The most\nrecent inflation readings have been more favorable than earlier in the year, however, and there\nhas been modest further progress toward our inflation objective. We will need to see more good\ndata to bolster our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.\nWe know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of\nthe progress that we’ve seen on inflation. At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or\ntoo little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment. In considering any\nadjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess\nincoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.\nIn our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an\nappropriate path for the federal funds rate, based on what each participant judges to be the most\nlikely scenario going forward. If the economy evolves as expected, the median participant\nprojects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 5.1 percent at the end of this\nyear, 4.1 percent at the end of 2025, and 3.1 percent at the end of 2026. But these projections are\nPage 3 of 27\nJune 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nnot a Committee plan or any kind of a decision. As the economy evolves, assessments of the\nappropriate policy, policy path will adjust in order to best promote our maximum-employment\nand price-stability goals. If the economy remains solid and inflation persists, we’re prepared to\nmaintain the current target range for the federal funds rate as long as appropriate. If the labor\nmarket were to weaken unexpectedly or if inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated,\nwe’re prepared to respond. Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that\nwe face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate. We’ll continue to make our decisions\nmeeting by meeting, based on the totality of the data and its implications for the outlook and the\nbalance of risks.\nThe Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy—maximum employment and\nstable prices. We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to\nkeeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Restoring price stability is essential to\nachieving maximum employment and stable prices over the long run. Our success in delivering\non these goals matters to all Americans. We understand that our actions affect communities,\nfamilies, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public\nmission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and\nprice-stability goals.\nThank you, and I look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Just wondering\nif you could walk me through the Committee’s average inflation forecast—core PCE is now\nforecast to be 2.8 percent by the year-end. It’s already 2.75, and after today’s number, there\nwere several forecasts on the street that it would be 2.6 at the end of this month. Does that tell\nPage 4 of 27\nJune 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nyou that the average official expects no further progress in inflation and, in fact, that it’s going to\nget worse? And if you have this wrong, doesn’t it mean that you sort of—you, you could have\nwrong the outlook for rates there?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah. So what’s going on there is that we had very low readings in\nthe second half of last year—June through December, really. And we’re now lapping those. So\nas you go through the 12-month window, a very low reading drops out, and a new reading comes\nin. The new reading gets added to the 12-month window. So it’s just a, a slight element of\nconservativism that we’re, we’re assuming a certain level of—of, you know, incoming monthly\nPCE and core PCE numbers. We’re assuming, you know, good, but not great, numbers. And if\nyou put that on top of where we are now, you get a very slight increase in the 12-month—in the\n12-month, you know, reading. Now, do we have high confidence that that’s right? No. It’s just\nthe kind of conservative way for forecasting things. If we were to get more readings like today’s\nreading, then, of course, that wouldn’t be the case. So it’s just a forecasting device. I think, I\nthink—let me say that we welcome today’s reading and then hope for more like that.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. But if it comes in—just to follow up—if it comes in the way you\nforecast it, it would seem strange for you to be cutting rates at all in context of a rising core PCE.\nThank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah—no. I mean, I think we’ve, we’ve—what we said is that we\ndon’t think it’ll be appropriate to, to reduce rates and begin to loosen policy until we have more\nconfidence that inflation is moving back down to 2 percent on a—on a sustainable basis. And\nthat’s the—that’s the test we’ve applied. I don’t know that—I think if we—I don’t know that\nthis rules that in or out. I mean, really, it’s, it’s a forecast—a fairly conservative forecast month\nby month that would lead to slightly higher, you know, 12-months rates by the end of the year.\nPage 5 of 27\nJune 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nIf we get, you know, good—better readings than that, then you will see that come down or, or\nremain the same. If you’re at 2.6, 2.7 [percent], you know, that’s, that’s a really good place to\nbe.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nick.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, if I look at\nthe, the rate projections, I see 15 of the 19 that are anticipating either one or two cut—two cuts\nthis year—fairly evenly split between the two. And so I wonder if you could explain a little\nmore the nuances or the differences there. Would two or three more inflation readings like the\none that we saw this morning make a September interest rate cut possible?\nCHAIR POWELL. So as far as the SEP part of that is concerned—as you know, I talk\nto—I talk to all of the other participants on the FOMC every cycle, and we talk about their\nSummary of Economic Projections and, and the dot plot—and, you know, their dot plot and\neverything. And what you—what I hear and see is that people are looking at, at, you know, a\nrange of plausible outcomes. And in many cases, they’re—they’re thinking, “I don’t really”—\nyou know, “I can’t really distinguish between two of these. They’re so close for me.” These are\nvery close calls, but we ask them to write down the most likely one—so they do. And as, I think,\nyou’ve, you’ve—as you’ve said, there’s 15 of the 19 are, are kind of clustered around one or\ntwo. So I think I would look at, at all—I’d look at all of them as plausible, but I’d look at—so I\nthink that does tell you kind of what the Committee thinks.\nBut what everyone agrees on is, it’s going to be data dependent. No one—no one brings\nto this or takes away from it that is on the Committee a really strong commitment to a particular\nrate path. It’s actually just their forecast and their—it’s a combination of their forecast and their\nown reaction function. But, again, everyone would say that this is very data dependent, and I\nPage 6 of 27\nJune 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ndon’t hold it with high confidence. And I think if you’re looking for—and, and don’t really\nthink that they’re—they’re not trying to send a strong signal that “this is what I think is the right\nthing.” It’s just what they think at a given moment in time, subject to data.\nIn terms of, you know, future meetings, we haven’t, you know—we don’t—we don’t try\nto—we don’t make decisions about future meetings until we get there. I think in terms of what\nwe need to see, I mentioned it earlier—we, we want to—we want to gain further confidence.\nCertainly, more good inflation readings will help with that. I’m not going to be specific about\nhow many because, you know, really, it’s going to be not just the inflation rating—readings—it’s\ngoing to be the totality of the data: what’s happening in the labor market, what’s happening with\nthe balance of risks, what’s happening with the forecast, what’s happening with growth. You\nlook at all of that, and you ask, “Are we confident? Have we reached an appropriate level of\nconfidence that inflation is moving down sustainably to 2 percent, or, alternatively, do we see\nreally unexpected signs of weakness in the labor market that would call for a response?”—which\nis—which is another thing that could, could happen. But, again, we don’t see that. And I—we\ndo see today’s—we see today’s report as, as progress and as, you know, building confidence.\nBut we, we don’t see ourselves as having the confidence that would warrant—you know, that\nwould warrant beginning to, to loosen policy at this time.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. And if I could quickly follow up—did, did you or any of your\ncolleagues change your interest rate projections after 8:30 or whenever you got the inflation\nnumbers today?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we—this happens too often, but it, it does happen. It just is, you\nknow—data came—I think it happened a couple of meetings ago—a few meetings ago. So when\nthat happens—when there’s an important data print during the meeting, first day or second day—\nPage 7 of 27\nJune 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nwhat we do is, we, we make sure people remember that they have the ability to update. We tell\nthem how to do that. And, and some people do; some people don’t. Most, most people don’t.\nBut I’m not going to get into the specifics, but you have the ability to do that. So that, you\nknow—what’s in the SEP actually does reflect the data that we got today to the extent you can,\nyou know, reflect it in one day. I think we’ll, you know—you will see PPI tomorrow. We’ll\nknow more about the PCE [inflation] reading as the month goes on. But the initial CPI reading\nand its, you know, kind of first-level translation to, to PCE [inflation] we did have this morning.\nWe were briefed about it, and people were able to consider whether they should make changes.\nAnd, as I said, you know, some people generally do, but most people generally don’t.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jonnelle.\nJONNELLE MARTE. Hi, Chair Powell. Jonnelle Marte from Bloomberg. As you\nnoted, the labor market is now in many ways back to where it was before the pandemic. I\nwondered if you could comment on how officials are viewing that. So do you think that there\nstill needs to be more cooling in the labor market to bring inflation all the way down to 2 percent,\nor is there any sense that maybe the labor market is more vulnerable now to higher rates now that\nmany of those imbalances have eased?\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So by, by so many measures, the labor market was, was kind\nof overheated two years ago. And we’ve seen it gradually move back into much better balance\nbetween supply and demand. So, what have we seen? We’ve seen labor force supply come up\nquite a bit through immigration and through recovering participation. That’s ongoing, mostly\nnow through the immigration channel. But still, we’ve had some increases in prime-age labor\nforce. In terms of on the demand side, you know, we’ve seen—well, we’ve seen quits moving\ndown. We’ve seen job openings moving down. We’ve seen wage increases moving from very,\nPage 8 of 27\nJune 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nvery high levels a couple of years ago back down to more sustainable levels. We have seen\nunemployment creep up now sixth-tenths over the course of, of a year or so very, very gradually.\nSo you put all that together—what you have is still-low unemployment, still 4 percent\nunemployment—historically low. But it’s moved up a little bit—it’s softened a bit—and, and,\nyou know, that’s an important statistic. But, but more than that, you’ve got strong job creation.\nYou, you have payroll jobs still coming in strong, even though, you know, there’s an argument\nthat they may be a bit overstated but still they’re, they’re still—they’re strong. So that’s what we\nsee. We, we watch the labor market, of course, and the economy as a whole—but the labor\nmarket very carefully—and that’s what we see. We see gradual cooling—gradual moving\ntoward better balance. We’re monitoring it carefully for signs of, of something more than that,\nbut we really don’t see that.\nJONNELLE MARTE. As a quick follow-up—the surveys that make up the jobs report\nare, are showing different tales. There’s been some divergence, especially, we saw, in the last\nreport that we got on Friday. So how do you interpret that, and, and how does it change your\nview on the labor market?\nCHAIR POWELL. So sometimes it’s—you can’t reconcile the differences. You just\nhave to, have to—have to look at it and, and try to understand. And that’s why it always makes\nsense to look at a series, you know, in 6—in 3, 6, and 12 months of things rather than just one\nreport. But you’re right to point to the last report, where it was your—job losses in the\nhousehold survey—job gains, big job gains in the establishment survey. So, I mean, we’re left\nwith ambiguous results, and we have to deal with that uncertainty around data. Nonetheless, the\noverall picture is one of a strong and gradually cooling—gradually rebalancing labor market.\nJob openings, while they’ve come way down, are still, you know, greater than the number of\nPage 9 of 27\nJune 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nunemployed people. The jobs–workers gap is still a significantly positive number—greater than\nit was before the pandemic. So, overall, we’re looking at what is still a very strong labor market\nbut not the superheated labor market of two years ago or even one year ago.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Neil.\nNEIL IRWIN. Thanks, Chair Powell. Neil Irwin, with Axios. Back on the rates path:\nThe SEP showed quite a large shift of rate cut expectations relative to March—that’s a period in\nwhich the economic data flow hasn’t been that dramatic a shift. How, how—can you provide\nsome color on what changed in the attitudes on the Committee over the last three months to, to\nsee a much shallower path of rate cuts this year?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah. The big thing that changed was the inflation forecast. So the\ninflation forecast moved up several tenths for the end of the year. And, and, as I mentioned\nearlier, in the, you know—what, what did we take away from this? We had really, really good\ninflation data in the second half of last year, then kind of a pause in progress in the first quarter.\nAnd what we took away from that was that it’s probably going to take longer to get the\nconfidence that we need to begin to loosen policy. So the sense of that is that rate cuts that might\ntake place in—might’ve taken place this year—take place next year, you know? We, we—there\nare—there are fewer rate cuts in the median this year, but there’s one more next year. So, so you\nreally—if you look at year-end 2025 and ’26, you’re, you’re almost exactly where you would\nhave been, just it—just it’s moved later because of that progress. Now, you get another—you\nget data—different data today. So we’ll have to see where the data light the way. You know,\nwe’re, we’re—the economy has, you know, repeatedly surprised forecasters in both directions,\nand today was certainly a better inflation report than almost anybody expected. And we’ll just\nPage 10 of 27\nJune 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nhave to see what, what—what the incoming data flow brings and, and how that affects the\noutlook and the balance of risks.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jeanna.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Jeanna Smialek, New York Times. Thanks for taking our\nquestions. In the Summary of Economic Projections, the long-run interest rate forecast moved\nup a bit. I wonder if we should read that as a sign that you think that policy is not sort of as\nrestrictive as we’ve previously expected. You know, how should we interpret what that means\nabout how the Committee views its current policy setting?\nCHAIR POWELL. So two things about that—one, one is this—you’re right, it did move\nup. But, but I want to remember to point out that the long-run neutral rate of interest is, is a\nlong-run concept. It, it really is a theoretical concept—can’t be directly observed. And what it is\nis the, the interest rate that would hold the economy at equilibrium—maximum employment and\nprice stability—potentially, potentially years in the future where there are no shocks. So it’s—\nit’s a little bit—it’s not something we observe today. Today we’ve got a very specific economy\nwith all kinds of shocks we’re still getting over from the pandemic. So it’s—I, I don’t think that\nthe, the concept of r-star—it’s a very important concept in economics and in what we do. But,\nhonestly, it doesn’t really get you where you need to be to think about what appropriate policy is\nin the near term.\nBut I, I—back to your original question, people have been gradually writing it up because\nI just think people are coming to the view that rates aren’t—are less likely to go down to their,\ntheir pre-pandemic levels, which were, you know, very low by recent history measures. Now,\nwe, we can’t really know that. That’s, that’s an interesting dispute and discussion to have now,\nbut, ultimately, we think that things like the neutral rate are driven by longer-run, slow-moving\nPage 11 of 27\nJune 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nforces. And, you know, there’s a really good question about whether, whether those really have\nchanged or whether, instead, rates and the economy are experiencing a, a series of persistent but,\nultimately, temporary shocks. That’s been the debate, and we can’t know. But in the meantime,\nwe’re making policy with the economy that we have—with the distortions that we have. And I, I\nalso—to your other point, I, I think it is—it is the case that as time has gone by, the question of\n“How restrictive is policy?” has become one that everyone’s asking, and we’re asking it, too.\nAnd, you know, my answer has been that policy is restrictive. The question of whether it’s\nsufficiently restrictive is going to be one we, we know over time. But I think for the reasons I’ve\ntalked about at the last press conference and, and other places, I think the evidence is pretty clear\nthat policy is restrictive and is having, you know, the effects that we would hope for.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Howard.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thanks, Chair Powell. Howard Schneider, with Reuters. Just\nto—just to carry that a little further, should we read this as a conclusion that the combination of\ntipping to one cut this year and acknowledging further progress on inflation as kind of a mark to\nmarket on the level of restrictiveness that you need—that you, in fact, have concluded that you\nweren’t quite there yet?\nCHAIR POWELL. I’d be reluctant to try to draw that conclusion. I, I think this is about,\nyou know, looking at the incoming data and asking, “How much progress are we making on\ninflation, and how is the rest of the economy doing? Is the labor market still strong?” That’s\nwhat we’re thinking about. You know, you can—you can translate it into the—into the language\nyou’re talking about, but, to me, the focus is more on, we have a goal, which is price stability,\nand another goal, which is maximum employment. How are we doing there? We think we’ve\ngot a good, strong labor market still. We think we’ve been making progress toward the price-\nPage 12 of 27\nJune 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nstability goal. And then for a while, there was a pause. And we look at today’s thing, and we\nthink, “Well, that’s a good reading, and we hope we get more like that.” And, you know, in the\nmeantime, we’re asking, “Is our policy stance about right?” And I think we think, “Yes, it’s\nabout right.” We’re prepared to adjust that as appropriate, but we think—we think we’re getting\nthe things that we would want to get, broadly speaking. And that’s why we’ve been at this\npolicy rate now for almost a year.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. So, so just to follow up on that—I think one, one curious\nthing here is, you’ve got now this restrictive policy in place and virtually no change in any of the\nmajor things for all of this year. You’ve got growth that stays above long-run potential\nthroughout the forecast period, unemployment that never goes above the long-run estimate—\nright?—of 4.2. So this isn’t a story of slack improving inflation. So where’s the improvement in\ninflation coming from that it’s going to pick up pace so much in 2025?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, you know, it’s been coming—where’s it been coming from—\nlet’s start with that. You know, clearly a lot of what—some of what we’ve been getting is just\nthe reversal of the—the unwinding of the pandemic-related distortions to both supply and\ndemand. And that is, you know—that is complemented by and amplified—supported by\nrestrictive monetary policy. So those two things have been working together. We’ve also had a\nvery positive supply shock on the labor side. And, and, also, you get—you get a positive supply\nshock when the—when the supply conditions unwind and return to normal. So you’ve had, you\nknow, above-trend potential growth and, and high growth. And yet you’ve had the benefit of, of\ninflation coming down, you know, really fast, actually, last year, and you will see what the rest\nof this year brinks—brings. So these dynamics can continue as long as they continue. I mean,\nultimately, the question is, ultimately, are you down to demand? And, and we don’t know that,\nPage 13 of 27\nJune 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthough. I mean, look at today’s report. You know, if we see more like that—you know, we\ndon’t—we can’t know what the future holds. But in the meantime, we’ve made pretty good\nprogress on inflation with our current stance.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Mike.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television. The base\ncase of the Committee seems to be that there is going to be at least one rate cut this year, but\nyour growth forecast doesn’t see any slowdown in the rest of the year, nor does the\nunemployment forecast see any significant weakening of the labor market. And your inflation\nforecasts basically average out to no change. So if, at the end of the year, there is no change\nfrom conditions now, why would you anticipate cutting rates? What, what would be the point\nfor a rate cut?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, we think—we think policy is restrictive. And we think,\nultimately, that if you—if you just set policy at a restrictive level, eventually you will see real\nweakening in the economy. So that’s always been the thought is that, you know, since we raise\nrates this far, we’ve, we’ve always been pointing to cuts at a certain point. Not to eliminate the\npossibility of hikes, but, you know, no one has that as their base case, so—no one on the\nCommittee does. But so that’s, that’s—you know, that’s how we think about it. And that’s what\nwe’ve been getting. That’s what we’ve been getting is good progress on inflation, with growth at\na—at a, a good level and with a strong labor market. Now, ultimately, we think rates will have\nto come down to continue to support that. But, so far, they haven’t had to. And, you know,\nthat’s why we’re watching so carefully for signs of weakness. We don’t really see that. We kind\nof see what we wanted to see, which was gradual cooling in demand—gradual rebalancing in the\nPage 14 of 27\nJune 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nlabor market while we’re continuing to make progress on inflation. So we’re getting—we’re\ngetting good results here.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. But, to follow up: Is there any kind of concern for the housing\nindustry or financial stability—banks—in leaving rates where they are for too long at this point?\nCHAIR POWELL. On housing—you know, the housing situation is a complicated one.\nAnd you can see that’s a place where rates are really having, having a significant effect. I mean,\nultimately, the best thing we can do for the housing market is to bring inflation down so that we\ncan bring rates down so that the housing market can continue to normalize. There will still be a\nnational housing shortage, as there was before the pandemic. There will still be one, but the\ndistortions that we see now with lock-ins and things like that—you know, low mortgages—in\nterms of banks, the banking system has been, you know, solid, strong, well capitalized.\nLending—you know, we’ve seen good performance by the banks. We had the turmoil earlier\nlast year, but, you know, banks have been focusing on bringing up their liquidity, bringing up\ntheir capital, and having a risk—risk-management plans in place. So the banking system, you\nknow, seems to be—seems to be in good shape.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Chris.\nCHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Thanks. Chris Rugaber at Associated Press. I was\nwondering if we can read—on inflation, if you can tell us a little more about where you see\ninflationary pressure in the economy. You mentioned labor markets coming into better balance,\nand inflation expectations appear to be well anchored. You’re seeing, you know, anecdotal\nstories of, the large chains like Walmart and Target are announcing price cuts—McDonald’s\nannouncing a $5 meal deal. So people may still be unhappy about prices at the grocery store, but\nPage 15 of 27\nJune 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nit doesn’t seem like there’s a lot of inflationary pressure left in this economy—and wonder if you\ncould tell us more about that.\nCHAIR POWELL. So I, I think it’s true that housing—that inflationary pressures have\ncome down. But we still have—we’re still getting high inflation readings. So, you know—and I\nthink you can see it in, in various places in—you know, in some parts of, of nonhousing services.\nYou see elevated inflation still—and that’s probably to do with—it could be to do with wages.\nGoods prices have kind of fluctuated. There’s been a surprising increase in, in import prices on\ngoods, which is kind of hard to understand. And, you know, may, may—we’ve taken some\nsignal from that, but, you know—and, and, of course, housing services. You’re seeing—you’re\ncontinuing to see high readings there to some extent. That’s, that’s, you know, catch-up inflation\nfrom earlier pressures. But, I mean, overall, you’re right. Inflationary pressures have come\ndown. As I mentioned, the labor market has come into better balance. Wages are still running,\nyou know, I would say, above a, a sustainable path, which would be that of trend inflation and\ntrend productivity. You’re still seeing wage increases moving above that. We, we haven’t\nthought of wages as being the principal, you know, cause of inflation. But at the same time,\ngetting back to 2 percent inflation is likely to require a return to a more sustainable level, which\nis somewhat below the current level of increases in the aggregate.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Rachel.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Hi, Chair Powell. Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. Thanks\nfor taking our questions. There’s obviously a lot of focus on how many cuts could be expected\nthis year. But can you give us a sense of what one cut by the end of the year would actually do\nto the economy—what you think would be a meaningful difference if there was a cut by the end\nof the year or even two?\nPage 16 of 27\nJune 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. I think if, you know—if you look back in 5 or 10 years and, and try\nto pull out the significance to the U.S. economy of one 25 basis point rate cut, you’d, you’d have\nquite a job on your hands. So that’s not how we look at it—you know, really, the whole rate\npath matters. And I, I do continue to think that when—you know, when we do start to loosen\npolicy, that will show up in a significant loosening in financial market conditions. And the\nmarket will price in what it prices in. I don’t—I have no way of saying—we’re, we’re not at that\nstage, so I don’t know what we’ll be thinking about at that time. But it’s a consequential\ndecision for the economy. And, you know, you want to—you want to get it right. And,\nfortunately, we have a strong economy, and we, we have the ability to, you know, approach this\nquestion carefully. And we will approach it carefully while we’re very much keeping an eye on,\nyou know, downside economic risks, should they—should they emerge.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. And you’ve been talking about this clear sense that it’s just going to\ntake longer to have the confidence that’s needed for rate cuts. Is there something about what\nhappened in the first couple of months of the year that you’re seeing differently now with more\ntime or hindsight? Do you still characterize it as expected bumpiness or something more lasting\nthat is affecting your policy for the rest of the year?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, we always want to avoid the tendency to dismiss the\nparts of inflation that we—that we don’t like and just make it go away. So—but we had a\nquarter where inflation was running higher, and, yes, I could stand here and say, “It’s stuff we\nshouldn’t have taken signal from.” But it is what it is. You know, you, you have to—you know,\nlow inflation is low inflation. High—so if you have a quarter where it’s higher—we tried not to\ntake signal from the first couple of months, but we got a third month, and we said, “Okay, the\nsignal we’re taking is that, you know, we think it’s going to take longer to get confidence that\nPage 17 of 27\nJune 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ninflation is moving sustainably down to 2 percent.” That’s, that’s what we said. I think that was\nthe right thing to do. I still think that’s the right thing to do. Now we have today’s inflation\nreading, which is very different—very much more positive. We’re going to have to see what the\ntrend is—what’s, what’s going to be the data going forward. We’re looking for something that\ngives us confidence that inflation is, is moving sustainably down to 2 percent. And readings like\ntoday’s, you know—that’s a step in the right direction. But, you know, one reading is—isn’t—it\njust—it’s only one reading. You don’t want to—you don’t want to be too motivated by any\nsingle data point.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jo Ling.\nJO LING KENT. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you for taking our questions. I’m Jo Ling\nKent, with CBS News. What’s your message to Americans who are seeing encouraging\neconomic data but don’t feel good about this economy?\nCHAIR POWELL. I, you know—I, I don’t think anyone knows—has a definitive answer\nwhy people are, are not as happy about the economy as they might be. And we don’t tell people\nhow they should think or feel about the economy. That’s not our job. We—you know, people\nexperience what they experience. All I can tell you is what the—what the data show, which is,\nwe’ve got an economy that’s growing at a solid pace. We’ve got a very strong labor market with\nunemployment at 4 percent. It’s been a long time since we’ve had, you know, a long stretch of\ntime with unemployment at or below 4 percent—very long time. We had a period of high\ninflation. We—inflation has come down really significantly, and we’re doing everything we can\nto—you know, to bring that inflationary episode fully to a halt and fully restore price stability.\nWe’re confident that we’ll get there. And in the meantime, you know, it’s going to be painful\nfor, for people, but the ultimate pain would be a, a period of long, high—a long period of high\nPage 18 of 27\nJune 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ninflation. It is people who—lower-income people—people who are at the margins of the\neconomy who, who have the worst experience—who experience the most pain from inflation.\nSo, you know, it’s for those people—for all Americans, but particularly for those people—that\nwe’re doing everything we can to bring inflation back down under control.\nJO LING KENT. As just a quick follow-up here—you’ve indicated one interest rate cut\nsometime this year. And I know you don’t have a crystal ball up there, but a lot of people are\nwatching and see, you know, borrowing money remains very expensive. For everybody who’s\nout there waiting on a rate cut, about when can consumers expect some relief?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, you know, I, I don’t have a precise date for you. But what we\nsaid is that we, we want to make sure that we’re confident that inflation is actually moving back\ndown to 2 percent. And when we are, then we can look at loosening policy. So having that kind\nof confidence that inflation will be at 2 percent just—it just pays benefits to the whole economy,\nto all Americans, for a long period of time. We had that period for a very long time. We very\nmuch want to get back to a place where people can, can not think about inflation—it’s just not a\nconcern in the everyday economic decisions that they make. We were there for a long time, and\nour goal is to get back to that place. And we’ve made good progress, and we’re just—we’re in\nthe phase now of just, you know, sticking with it until we get it done.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Claire.\nCLAIRE JONES. Claire Jones, Financial Times. I’m just drawing on the change in the\nstatement on there being “modest further progress” on inflation. You know, halfway, you know,\nthrough the year and after today’s CPI release, you know, what have you and other Committee\nmembers found that has been particularly encouraging to you? And just in terms of the\nPage 19 of 27\nJune 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nconservatism, how much of that is about stickiness and shelter inflation in particular?\nThank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So, encouraging has been that growth—you know, the growth,\nclearly, that we had last year, particularly the second half of last year, and we continue to see\nstill-strong growth—solid growth this year. That’s been very encouraging. If you go back a\nyear, there was a real concern about, you know, very much slowing growth and, and a\nrecession—many forecasters had that. And that’s not what happened. Instead, we—the U.S. is,\nanyway, and it’s in—it’s in sharp distinction with many other advanced economies around the\nworld. So that’s been encouraging. I would say that the, the—today’s inflation report is\nencouraging, but it comes after, you know, several reports that were not so encouraging.\nYou asked about—your second question was really about shelter inflation. So I think if\nyou go back a couple of years—we, we know that there were renters, and then there are, you\nknow, people who own their houses. And we have OER, which is owners’ equivalent rent. And\nso when market-based rents go up sharply, as they did at the beginning of the—of the—when the\neconomy reopened, they really went up sharply. Those play into rollover rents much more\nslowly for existing tenants than they do for new tenants. And, and so what we—so we, we’ve\nfound now that there are big lags. So there’s sort of a—there’s a bulge of high past increases in,\nin market rents. It has to get worked off, and that may take, you know, several years.\nNonetheless, as long as market rents remain—are going at—up at relatively low levels—and\nthey still are—you know, this, this is just going to happen. It just is going to happen more slowly\nthan we thought.\nYou know, we, we also do sort of this thing where we impute a rental value to, to owned\nhomes. And that’s—you know, many countries around the world do that. Some do it differently\nPage 20 of 27\nJune 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthan us. It’s something that the—you know, that the, the price experts have regularly looked at.\nIt is not something that we’re the only country that does, and it’s not something we’re looking at\nchanging or would look at changing, you know, anytime soon. But it—it’s true. It’s one of the\nvery hardest things in, in inflation and in prices is how to think about, you know, the services\nthat someone is getting by living in a home that they could rent, but they’re actually living in it.\nAnd some countries—you should just ignore that. But that’s not our—that’s not how we do\ninflation here. We, we do it the way we do it, and we’ve been very transparent about it. And,\nyou know, it’s true that we’re—we’re seeing delays in, in realizing what—what’s happening\neconomically. But we understand that—you know, we understand that very well.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Edward.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Edward Lawrence, with Fox Business. Thank you for taking\nthe question, Chair Powell. So I want to go back to jobs and the consumer. The last jobs report\nshowed that over the past year, 634,000 more people took multiple jobs. That’s up 8.2 percent.\nAnd since January of 2021, we’ve seen prices rise 19 percent. So people are using their credit\ncards to pay for their lifestyle. What pressure points will signal to you that the slowing economy\ncould maybe break companies in terms of hiring or break the consumer in terms of spending?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, you know, we monitor all the things you mentioned and more.\nYou know, what we’re seeing is, basically, spending was going up faster than disposable income\nduring big parts of next year, so—last year, rather—and so what that—you’d expect to see is\npeople spending more on their credit cards. That—that has been happening. Credit card\nbalances have been going up. Credit card defaults have been going up. They’re not at high\nlevels. Remember that after the pandemic, people were cooped up. They couldn’t spend money.\nThey couldn’t go out to spend money; they could spend money from home. But households\nPage 21 of 27\nJune 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nwere in very, very strong—historically strong—financial shape. They’ve now worked off a lot\nof that. So we’re, we’re watching that carefully. And, you know, what do we see? That’s what\nwe see. We, we see the same data that everybody else sees, but you’ve still got a household\nsector that’s in—that’s in pretty good shape. You know—but, nonetheless, it’s not in the kind of\nshape it was in a year or two ago. And we’re, you know—we’re carefully watching that.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. So how close then are we to that point where the consumer\ncan’t continue to spend as it’s spending or companies can’t hire like they’re hiring?\nCHAIR POWELL. So consumer spending is still growing. It’s not growing at the pace it\nwas growing at a year or so ago, but, but it’s still—it’s still growing solidly. And, by the way,\nother parts of the economy are picking up. Spending on equipment and intangibles is—has\npicked up quite a bit, you know, in the wake of all the construction that we saw of new tech—\nyou know, tech plants. So, overall, the economy is exhibiting solid growth, and, you know—\nsomething around 2 percent—which is—which is, you know, good—a good pace of growth for\nthe U.S. economy. But, no, you’re, you’re right, though. We, we do see the same thing other\npeople see, which is, you know, increasing financial pressures on, you know, more lower-income\npeople. And, and, you know, the best thing we can do is, is to foster a very strong jobs economy,\nwhich we think we have done—ultimately to get inflation under control, because those people\nexperience inflation, you know, very directly—very painfully. And, and, you know, once, once\nwe get inflation under control, rates can come down—which, which will also improve things.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi. Victoria Guida with Politico. You’ve mentioned that\nunexpected weakening in the labor market would, would bring rate cuts sooner. And I was just\nwondering—can you talk a little bit about what that would look like? Is it more of, like, a\nPage 22 of 27\nJune 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nquicker pace of people losing jobs? Is it more the level of the unemployment rate if it were to\nstart to go above 4.2 or something like that? How are you thinking about what you’re looking\nfor to see the job market unexpectedly weaken?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know—you know, when I say “unexpectedly,” the first thing is\nmore than, kind of, is in our forecast or in common forecasts—so, something more than that.\nBut we’ll be looking at everything. You know, we’ll—the, the labor market, you know, has the\nability—has, has the tendency sometimes to, to weaken quickly. So waiting for that to happen is,\nis not what we’re doing. You know, we’re watching very carefully; we’re looking at the balance\nof risks. I always point out the balance of risks, so—and, and also the fact that we look at, at all\nof it—the whole situation. So, you know, a decision to begin to—you know, to loosen policy\ncould have several reasons associated with it at a given time. But I, you know, I would just—\nyou know, we monitor all the—all the labor market data. And if we saw troubling—weakening\nmore than—more than expected, then that would be something we’d consider responding to. But\nwe’d look at the—we look at the broader context of what’s going on, too.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. So something like negative payroll numbers would be—\nCHAIR POWELL. I’m not going to—yeah, I mean, I, I can think of things that would—\nmany things would make it on that list, but I don’t think I’ll, I’ll utter them here.\nSIMON RABINOVITCH. Thank you, Chair Powell. Simon Rabinovitch with the\nEconomist. May I ask—you mentioned, with the slightly higher PCE [inflation] readings earlier\nthis year, that it wasn’t one or two months but three months that tipped you to be a bit more\ncautious in the rate outlook. Should we take from that that—you know, it looks like May will be\nquite good for PCE [inflation], as it was for CPI—does that imply that kind of two more good\nPage 23 of 27\nJune 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nmonths would reinstill the confidence that rate cuts could be coming sooner than you currently\nproject?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, I, I don’t actually have that kind of mechanical thing in,\nin my thinking. I, I get that, you know—as many good ones as we had bad ones—but it’s not\nlike that. It’s the whole. It’s going to be the totality of the data—[including] labor market data,\nthe growth data. In terms of inflation, you know, you’d, you’d want to see real progress that\nbuilds your confidence that we’re—that we are on a path down to 2 percent. And I, I don’t want\nto try to give you specific numbers of things, because that points to dates, and I, I just don’t\nthink—we’re not at a point of being able to do that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Kosuke.\nKOSUKE TAKAMI. Thank you for doing this. I, I am Kosuke Takami, with Nikkei. I\nwould like to know about the impact of a stronger dollar on U.S. economic growth and prices.\nAnd I have no doubt that markets should determine the exchange rate, but in—Japan and some\nemerging markets are suffering from the strong dollar. So I want to know if it is having a\npositive impact on U.S. economy in total? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So we don’t—actually, it’s our—it’s our finance ministry, the\nTreasury Department, that has a responsibility for thinking about and, and, if it sees fit, doing\nthings about the level of the dollar. So for us, it’s just another financial variable. And you’re\nright—the dollar has been—has exhibited, exhibited some strength over the course of the last\nyear or so because the U.S. economy is very strong. We don’t think of it as benefiting or hurting\nthe U.S. We don’t—again, we don’t manage the level of the dollar. That’s, that’s not our—\nthat’s not our job. It’s not. You know—and for, for our economy, what, you know, we’re trying\nPage 24 of 27\nJune 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nto foster is maximum employment and price stability. And we feel like we’ve made good\nprogress on, on both of those goals over the course of the past year.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jennifer.\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. Thank you, Chair Powell. Jennifer Schonberger, with\nYahoo Finance. You said you would cut rates before inflation falls to 2 percent. You’re\nforecasting inflation to end the year at 2.8 percent on core PCE. We’re at 2.8 percent, of course,\non core PCE. Right now, you said the inflation forecast is conservative and that if you got to\n2.6 to 2.7 [percent] on PCE [inflation], that would be a good place to be. You also indicated the\njob market has mostly normalized. So why not cut rates this summer just once—you’re well\nabove neutral—to try to preserve the soft landing rather than risking waiting too long in the quest\nfor confidence for inflation?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know—so we are—we’re well aware of the two-sided risks\nhere, let me just say. We, we understand that if we wait too long, that could come at the cost of\neconomic activity, of employment, of the expansion. We understand that if we move too, too\nquickly, we could end up undoing a lot of the good that we’ve done and have to then start over,\nand it could be very disruptive. So we’re, we’re extremely aware of both of those risks and, and\njust basically trying to manage them. And what we said is that we’ll—that we’re—we don’t\nthink it’ll be appropriate to, to begin to loosen policy until we’re more confident that inflation is\nmoving down to 2 percent over time on a sustainable basis. That’s—that’s kind of been our test.\nOr there’s another test, which is, you know, an unexpected deterioration in labor market\nconditions. So I think that’s, that’s the right way for us to think about it. That’s our—that’s our\ndual mandate there. And, you know, we, we have a strong economy. We’ve got growth—all\nforecasts are very commonly around 2 percent. That’s a—that’s a strong growth rate for our\nPage 25 of 27\nJune 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\neconomy. The labor market continues to print jobs at a pretty high rate. Unemployment is still\nlow. So we have the ability now to approach this question carefully, and that’s, that’s what\nwe’re doing.\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. And just to follow, Chair Powell—do you need to be\nahead of a weakening in the labor market? Otherwise, is it too late, given that the labor market is\na lagging indicator—right?—when you look at the monthly jobs data?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah, we, we completely understand that that’s the risk. And that’s,\nthat’s not what we’re—that’s not our plan is to wait for things to break and then try to fix them.\nWe’re, we’re trying to balance these two goals in a way that is consistent with our framework,\nand we think we’re doing that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Evan.\nEVAN RYSER. Thank you, Chair Powell. Evan Ryser with Market News International.\nYou have mentioned before the framework review process will start in the latter half of the year.\nAt this point, do you have any specific time frame for the start of that? Who will lead it? Will\nyou be—will it be you or a member—a Committee group of your—of your peers? What will be\nthe parameters? Do you anticipate the review will consider changes in communications going\nforward?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we—what, what we’ve been thinking is that we would announce\nand commence the review later or late in the year. In the meantime, as that time approaches, we\nwill be devoting a lot of careful thought and planning to the contours of it. Within scope would\ncertainly be communications generally. I—I’m not going to say that we’ll look at this or that\nparticular thing. And all the other details, you know—we’re just—we don’t want to get\nPage 26 of 27\nJune 12, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nprematurely into a conversation until it’s really time to have it. And so, you know, I’m going to\nleave pretty much everything else to, to later in the year.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Go to Nancy, for the last question.\nNANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Hi, Chair Powell. Nancy Marshall-Genzer, with\nMarketplace. Just one more question on housing—can you still cut rates with shelter prices high,\nor will you wait until they start to moderate a bit?\nCHAIR POWELL. I wouldn’t—there isn’t any one thing—one variable, like housing\nprices moderating, that would really decide or decide against what we’re doing. We’ve got an\noverall test, which is greater confidence that inflation is moving down to 2 percent on a\nsustainable basis. That’s our overall test. Or, alternatively, we see unexpected weakening in the\nlabor market. So those are—those are two different tests. I would say, you know, we’re not—\nwe’re not looking at any one price in any one sector and saying, “That’s the one.” We don’t\ntarget housing prices, for example. And we don’t target wages. We, we target aggregate prices\nand overall employment, so—\nNANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. But if housing prices remain sticky, could that slow\ndown the pace of rate cuts?\nCHAIR POWELL. I think you’d look at the over—we’d be looking at the aggregate\nnumbers and, and asking ourselves, “What’s going on here with inflation in the—at the\naggregate level?” And, you know—and, of course, if, if—any price that contributed to ongoing\ninflation would, would matter. Any price that contributed to ongoing disinflation would matter,\ntoo, but I wouldn’t single out housing as having a, a special role there.\nThank you very much.\nPage 27 of 27"

    "press_conf": "July 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nTranscript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference\nJuly 31, 2024\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on\nachieving our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of\nthe American people. Our economy has made considerable progress toward both goals over the\npast two years. The labor market has come into better balance, and the unemployment rate\nremains low. Inflation has eased substantially from a peak of 7 percent to 2.5 percent. We are\nstrongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal in support of a strong economy\nthat benefits everyone.\nToday, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to\nreduce our securities holdings. We are maintaining our restrictive stance of monetary policy in\norder to keep demand in line with supply and reduce inflationary pressures. We are attentive to\nrisks on both sides of our dual mandate, and I will have more to say about monetary policy after\nbriefly reviewing economic developments.\nRecent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid\npace. GDP growth moderated to 2.1 percent in the first half of the year, down from 3.1 percent\nlast year. Private domestic final purchases, or PDFP—which excludes inventory investment,\ngovernment spending, and net exports and usually sends a clearer signal of underlying demand—\ngrew at a 2.6 percent pace over that same period, the first half. Growth of consumer spending\nhas slowed from last year’s robust pace but remains solid. Investment in equipment and\nintangibles has picked up from its anemic pace last year. In the housing sector, investment\nstalled in the second quarter after a strong rise in the first. Improving supply conditions have\nsupported resilient demand and the strong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year.\nPage 1 of 25\nJuly 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nIn the labor market, supply and demand conditions have come into better balance.\nPayroll job gains averaged 177,000 jobs per month in the second quarter—a solid pace, but\nbelow that seen in the first quarter. The unemployment rate has moved up but remains low at\n4.1 percent. Strong job creation over the past couple of years has been accompanied by an\nincrease in the supply of workers, reflecting increases in participation among individuals aged\n25 to 54 years and a strong pace of immigration. Nominal wage growth has eased over the past\nyear, and the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed. Overall, a broad set of indicators suggests that\nconditions in the labor market have returned to about where they stood on the eve of the\npandemic—strong, but not overheated.\nInflation has eased notably over the past two years but remains somewhat above our\nlonger-run goal of 2 percent. Total PCE prices rose 2.5 percent over the 12 months ending in\nJune; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose\n2.6 percent. Longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a\nbroad range of surveys of households and businesses and forecasters, as well as measures from\nfinancial markets.\nMy colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as\nit erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials\nlike food, housing, and transportation. Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual\nmandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. In\nsupport of these goals, the Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for\nthe federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue reducing our securities holdings. As\nthe labor market has cooled and inflation has declined, the risks to achieving our employment\nPage 2 of 25\nJuly 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nand inflation goals continue to move into better balance. Indeed, we’re attentive to the risks to\nboth sides of our dual mandate.\nWe’ve stated that we do not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range for the\nfederal funds rate until we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably\ntoward 2 percent. The second quarter’s inflation readings have added to our confidence, and\nmore good data would further strengthen that confidence. We will continue to make our\ndecisions meeting by meeting. We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much\ncould result in a reversal of the progress we have seen on inflation. At the same time, reducing\npolicy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment. In\nconsidering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will\ncarefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.\nAs the economy evolves, monetary policy will adjust in order to best promote our\nmaximum-employment and price-stability goals. If the economy remains solid and inflation\npersists, we can maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate as long as appropriate.\nIf the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than\nanticipated, we are prepared to respond. Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and\nuncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.\nThe Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy—maximum employment and\nstable prices. We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to\nkeeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Restoring price stability is essential to\nachieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. Our success in\ndelivering on these goals matters to all Americans. We understand that our actions affect\ncommunities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our\nPage 3 of 25\nJuly 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\npublic mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment\nand price-stability goals. Thank you. I look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jeanna.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times. Thanks for taking our\nquestions. Markets pretty much entirely expect a rate cut in September at this stage. I wonder if\nyou think that’s a reasonable expectation, and, if so, why not just make the move today?\nCHAIR POWELL. Thank you. So on September, let me say this. We, we have made no\ndecisions about future meetings, and that includes the September meeting. The broad sense of\nthe Committee is that the economy is moving closer to the point at which it will be appropriate to\nreduce our policy rate. In that, we will be data dependent but not data point dependent, so it will\nnot be a question of responding specifically to one or two data releases. The question will be\nwhether the totality of the data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks are consistent with\nrising confidence on inflation and maintaining a solid labor market. If that test is met, a\nreduction in our policy rate could be on the table as soon as the next meeting in September.\nSo you asked, why not today? And I would just say, again, that the broad sense of the\nCommittee is that we’re getting closer to the point at which it will be appropriate to reduce our\npolicy rate but that we’re not quite at that point yet.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Howard.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. So just to, to follow up on that a bit, if inflation behaves as\nyou expect between now and September, would you regard a cut in September as sort of the\nbaseline scenario right now?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I guess I would—I would think about it this way. I’ll give an\nexample of, of cases in which it would be appropriate to cut and maybe that it wouldn’t be\nPage 4 of 25\nJuly 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nappropriate to cut. So if we were to see, for example, inflation moving down quickly or more or\nless in line with expectations, growth remains, let’s say, reasonably strong, and the labor market\nremains, you know, consistent with its current condition, then I would think that a, a rate cut\ncould be on the table at the September meeting.\nIf, if inflation were to prove, you know, sticky and we were to see higher readings from\ninflation, disappointing readings, we would weigh that along with the other things. You know, I\nthink it’s going to be not just any one thing. It’s going to be the inflation data, it’s going to be\nthe employment data, it’s going to be the balance of risks as we see it—it’s going to be the\ntotality of all of that that would help us make this decision.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. And just to follow up on that—specifically, in what ways\nright now, given all you’ve seen over the last few months, in particular on shelter, on services, et\ncetera, in what ways are you not confident right now that inflation is on the way back to\n2 percent?\nCHAIR POWELL. I, I think it’s just a question of seeing more good data. We have\nseen—the last couple of readings have, have certainly added to confidence. And we’ve seen\nprogress across all three categories of core PCE inflation—that’s goods, nonhousing services,\nand housing services. So it’s really just—you know, we had a quarter of poor inflation data at\nthe beginning of the year. Then we saw some more good inflation data; we had seven months at\nthe end of last year. You know, we just want to see more and, and gain confidence. And, as I\nsaid, we have—we did gain confidence, and more good data would cause us to, to gain more\nconfidence.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Colby.\nPage 5 of 25\nJuly 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCOLBY SMITH. Thank you. Colby Smith with the Financial Times. The March SEP\npointed to three cuts in 2024, with core inflation at 2.6 percent and the unemployment rate at\n4 percent. Since we’re now at that level in terms of inflation and already beyond what was\nprojected for the labor market, I’m just wondering if that rate path is back to being the best\nguidepost for policy rather than, let’s say, the shallower one laid out in that June SEP.\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, so I would just say, really, the path ahead is going to\ndepend on the way the economy evolves. And I can’t really give you any, any better forward\nguidance on it than that. We didn’t, of course, do an SEP at this meeting. We will do another\none at the September meeting. I would just say, I can—I can imagine a scenario in which there\nwould be everywhere from zero cuts to several cuts, depending on the way the economy evolves,\nand I wouldn’t want to lay out a baseline path for you there today. I’ve said what I—what I can\nsay about September and about today, though.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nick.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, you’ve said\nbefore that you wouldn’t wait until inflation got to 2 percent to cut rates because of how inflation\nhas lagged. Does that apply for the labor market, too? If the labor market is back in equilibrium,\nwhy is restrictive policy and, potentially, very restrictive policy, given the high real funds rate,\nwarranted right now?\nCHAIR POWELL. So this is the very reason that we’re thinking about—that we’ve said\nin our—in our statement that we’re going back to looking at both mandates and that we think the\nrisks are coming back into balance. We think what the data broadly show in the labor market is\nan ongoing, gradual normalization of labor market conditions. And that’s what we want to see.\nYou know, we’ve seen that over a period of a couple of years and a move, really, from\nPage 6 of 25\nJuly 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\noverheated conditions to more normal conditions. We are watching the labor market conditions\nquite closely, and that’s what we’re seeing. If we—if we start to see something that looks to be\nmore than that, then we’re well positioned to respond. That’s, that’s part of what we’re thinking.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. And when you talk about seeing something that’s more than\nwhatever softness or slowdown you expect, in the past you’ve said that stronger growth\nwouldn’t, wouldn’t override better news on inflation. I wonder how that cuts the other way. If\nyou’re seeing more softness in the labor market than what you would expect, does that change\nthe calculus on what you’re looking for out of the inflation numbers to recalibrate policy?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we have, we have—growth isn’t one of our three. We have two\nmandates, as you know. The labor market, maximum employment is one, and stable prices is\nanother. So we weigh—we weigh those two things equally under the law. When we were far\naway from our inflation mandate, we had to focus on that. Now we’re back, back to a closer to\neven focus, so we’ll be looking at labor market conditions and asking whether we’re getting what\nwe’re seeing.\nAnd, as I said, we’re prepared to respond if we see that it’s—that it’s not what we wanted\nto see, which was, you know, a gradual normalization of conditions—if we see more than that.\nAnd it wouldn’t be any one statistic, although, of course, the unemployment rate is generally\nthought to be, you know, a single—a good single statistic. But we’d be looking at wages, we’d\nbe looking at participation, we’d be looking at all the things—surveys, quits, hires, all of those\nthings—to determine the overall status of the labor market. But we’re looking at it now.\nI would say, again, I think you’re back to conditions that are close to 2019 conditions,\nand that was not an inflationary economy—broadly similar labor markets then. I think inflation\nwas actually—core inflation was actually running below 2 percent. So we don’t think—I don’t\nPage 7 of 25\nJuly 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nnow think of the labor market in its current state as a likely source of significant inflationary\npressures. So I would—I would not like to see a material further cooling in the labor market, and\nthat’s part of what’s behind our thinking. The other part, of course, is that we have made real\nprogress on inflation. And we’re—we’ve got growing confidence there that we are not quite\nthere yet, but we’re more confident that we’re on a—that we’re on a sustainable path down to\n2 percent. So those two things are working together, and we’re factoring those both into our\npolicy.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Chris.\nCHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Chris Rugaber at Associated Press. You mentioned not\nwanting to see any further cooling in the job market. Why not? Or would you consider\npreemptive cuts to prevent if you saw risks of an unexpected cooling? Is that something you\nwould cut ahead of time for?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I wouldn’t say I wouldn’t want to see any other cooling. It would\nbe more of a material difference. If we—if we’d be looking at this and if we see something that\nlooks like a more significant downturn, that would be something that we would—we would have\nthe intention of responding to. So, in terms of—I don’t think of it that way. I think of it as, you\nknow, we’re actually in a good place here. We’re balancing these two risks of, you know, go too\nsoon, and you undermine progress on inflation; wait too long or don’t go fast enough, and, and\nyou put at risk the recovery. And so we have to balance those two things. That’s the nature of\nhaving two mandates, and I think we—this is how we balance them. It’s a rough balance, but it\ndoes feel like, again, the labor market feels like it’s in a place where it’s just a process of\nongoing normalization; 4.1 percent unemployment is still historically low. And, you know, we’ll\njust have to see what the data show us.\nPage 8 of 25\nJuly 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHRISTOPHER RUGABER. And, just to follow up quickly: [I] wanted to see what\nyou thought of the recent JOLTS report, which did show hiring, gross hiring, has come down\neven below 2019 levels. Layoffs remain low. So it painted a picture of a very static labor\nmarket. Is that sustainable in your view or something that is worrying? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think all of the data points continue to point to kind of the\ndirection we would want to see. So that was taken as, you know, there was a decline in job\nopenings. That was good. Today’s ECI reading was a little softer than expected, so that’s, that’s\na good reading. It shows that wage increases are still at a strong level but that that level\ncontinues to come down to more sustainable levels over time. That’s exactly the pattern that we\nwant to be seeing. So I think the data—the data we’ve been seeing in the labor market are\nbroadly consistent with that normalization process. Again, we’re closely monitoring to see\nwhether it starts to show signs that it’s more than that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Mr. Chairman, back in March, you talked\nabout cutting rates as a process, and, in June, you talked about the idea that, well, one rate cut\nwouldn’t do anything. So I wonder if you can sort of—following up on Colby’s question—talk\nabout, are you weighing the economy right now in terms of its ability to withstand multiple rate\ncuts? Talk us through the process that you think—or is it just one rate cut? Or are you in the\nprocess now of thinking that rates need to be normalized here? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah, I can’t really say that, honestly. You know, we’re—we—\nwe’ve seen significant movement in the labor market, and, you know, we’re very mindful of this\nquestion of, is it just normalization or is it more? We think it’s just normalization, but we want\nto be in a position to, to support the labor market. At the same time, we’re seeing progress on\nPage 9 of 25\nJuly 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ninflation. So, you know, we actually got to this—we raised rates a year ago at the July meeting.\nAnd if you look at the situation in the economy a year ago, unemployment—sorry, inflation was\nover 4 percent. It was a completely different economy. Now we’ve made a lot of progress, and\nthe labor market—I think unemployment was in the 3s, mid-3s, so it’s a different economy. And\nI think it’s time, it’s coming to be time, to adjust that so that we support this continued process.\nThe thing we’re trying to do is—you know that we have, we’ve had this really significant\ndecline in inflation, and unemployment has remained low. And this is a really unusual and\nhistorically, historically unusual and such a welcome outcome for the people we serve. What\nwe’re thinking about all the time is, how do we keep this going? And this is—this is part of that.\nWe think we don’t need to be 100 percent focused on inflation because of the progress we’ve\nmade: 12-month headline at 2½ [percent], core at 2.6. You know, it’s way down from where it\nwas. The job is not done on inflation, but, nonetheless, we can afford to begin to dial back the\nrestriction in our policy rate. And I think we’re just—it’s part of a process.\nIn terms of what that looks like, I mean, I think most rate—you would think, in a base\ncase, that policy rates would move down from here, but I don’t want to try to give specific\nforward guidance about when that might be, the pace at which it might happen, because I think\nthat’s really going to depend on the economy, and that’s highly uncertain.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Rachel.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Hi, Chair Powell. Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. Thanks\nfor taking our questions. On inflation, do the past few months of good reports look like what we\nsaw last year, where you really had a lot of momentum, with a few bumps in between? Would\nyou characterize that kind of momentum as back on track at this point in the year?\nPage 10 of 25\nJuly 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. Actually, what we’re seeing now is a little better than what we saw\nlast year. Last year, as we pointed out late in the year, a whole lot of the progress we saw last\nyear was from goods prices, which were going down at an unsustainable rate, disinflating at an\nunsustainable rate. This is a broader disinflation. This has goods prices coming down, but it’s\nalso—we’re also now seeing progress in the other two big categories: nonhousing services and\nhousing services. So, you know, the thing is, we’ve only—you’ve got one quarter of that. We\nhad seven months of low inflation; you got one quarter of this. I would say the quality of this is,\nis higher, and it’s good, but so far, it’s only a quarter. So I think, you know, we need to see more\nto know that we’re—to have more confidence that we’re on, on a good path down to 2 percent.\nBut as I mentioned, our confidence is growing because we’ve been getting good data. And\nthings like the ECI report and, frankly, the softening in the labor market conditions, you know,\ngive you more confidence that the economy’s not overheating. It doesn’t look like an\noverheating economy, and it looks like an economy that’s normalizing.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. And if we’re to think about the first couple months of the year, is\nthere any sense now that they were these blips that could have actually allowed for earlier rate\ncuts as were some of the projections going into 2024?\nCHAIR POWELL. So the thing about—if what it is is seasonality, and it could just be—\nit’s very, very hard to, you know, to do appropriate seasonal adjustments. If that’s what it is,\nthen that actually implies that, that other months were underreporting too low inflation. If you\nsmoothed it out, it’s a zero-sum game. And that’s why we look at 12 months. We look at\n12 months because that takes all of that out, all those effects out. Twelve-month now is\n2½ percent headline, 2.6 percent core. This is so much better than where we were even a year\nago. It’s a lot better. Now, the job is not done. I want to stress that, and we’re committed to\nPage 11 of 25\nJuly 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ngetting the job—inflation sustainably under 2 percent, but we need to take note of that progress,\nand we need to weigh the risks to the labor market and the risks to our inflation target now more\nequally than we did a year ago.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Michael McKee.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television. I’d like to\nask you about the balance of risks as the American people see it. At this point, is the risk greater\nto leave interest rates where they are, given the damage that higher interest rates do to the\neconomy in slowing demand and raising prices? Or is it more important for the American people\nthat you keep rates where they are to bring inflation down?\nCHAIR POWELL. I, I—you know, I think that we’ve been given an assignment by\nCongress. This is how we serve the American people is by achieving maximum employment\nand price stability, right? And so in our, you know, quasi-constitutional document, the Statement\non Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, we look at the two goals, and if one of\nthem is farther away than the other—the two variables, inflation and employment—if one is\nfarther away from its goal than the other, then you, you concentrate on the one that’s farther\naway. And you take account of the time to reach the goal.\nSo, for the last couple of years, the best service we could do to the American people was\nto focus on inflation. But as inflation has come down—and I think the upside risks to inflation\nhave decreased as the labor market has cooled off, and now the labor market has softened—you\nknow, probably the inflation, inflation’s probably a little farther from its target than is\nemployment, but I think the downside risks to, to the employment mandate are, are real now. So\nwe have to weigh all that, and if you think about where that takes us is we have a restrictive\npolicy rate. It’s clearly restrictive. It’s been the rate we’ve had in place for a full year. And the\nPage 12 of 25\nJuly 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ntime is coming—as other central banks around the world are facing the same question—the time\nis coming at which it will begin to be appropriate to dial back that level of restrictions, restriction\nso that we may address both mandates.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Well, you have event risk basically, with the jobs report on Friday\nand another one before you meet again. Are you certain that you won’t fall behind the curve and\nlead to unnecessary unemployment if you wait until September?\nCHAIR POWELL. “Certainty” is not a word that we have in our—in our business. So,\nyou know, we get—we get a lot of data between now and September, and it isn’t going to be one\ndata read or even two. It’s going to be the totality of the data, all of the data, and not just—and\nthen how is that affecting the outlook? And how is it affecting the balance of risks? That’s\ngoing to be the assessment that we do. Of course, we’ll, we’ll all look carefully at the\nemployment report, but so much other data coming in and so much happening between now and\nthe September meeting, and we’ll, you know, we’ll make a judgment.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Edward.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Edward Lawrence of Fox\nBusiness. I do want to dig deeper on what Michael and, and what Nick were asking. There’s a,\na shift in the statement to balance between the focus between inflation and jobs. Looking at the\njob sides, we’ve seen wage data show sort of an abrupt slowing. We’ve—we’re hearing on\nearnings calls from companies like Intel abrupt layoffs. In the jobs report from the BLS,\ngovernment jobs has been a leading creator. Could the government jobs—as a sector—hiring\nmask underlying weakness in the jobs report?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, you know, we’ll look at everything. We’ve seen some, some\ntendency to have a narrowing base of job creation in some months going back, but then we’ve\nPage 13 of 25\nJuly 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nhad some months where, where job creation was broader. And also, you know, the headline\nnumber of jobs has come down, so—but you look at the whole thing. And I think you do look at\nprivate demand extra carefully, to your point about, about government. So we’ll just be looking\nat, at all those things.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Just as a follow then—so could the Fed then be behind the\ncurve? Because you said some of the reports—in the last meeting, you said the reports could be\nnoisy or overstated. Was there a discussion of, of—what kind of discussion was there for a cut\ntoday, and could the Fed be “behind the curve”?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah, so look, the objective is to balance the two risks, right? It’s\nthe risk of going too soon and the risk of going too late. We’ve been—you know, we, we had\nseven months of good inflation data at the end of last year. We said we wanted to see more. We\nsaid—we pointed out that too much of this was coming from goods, and, sure enough, the first\nquarter wasn’t, wasn’t great—inflation data. And now we’ve got another quarter—a quarter that\nis good. And, you know, we’re balancing the risk of going too soon against the risk of going too\nlate. That’s what we’re doing. There’s no guarantee in this. It’s a very difficult judgment call,\nbut this is—this is how we’re making it.\nSo—but in terms of today, your question about today, we did have a—you know, we had\na nice conversation about, about this issue today. The overall sense of the Committee, as I\nmentioned, is that we’re getting closer to the point at which it will be appropriate to begin to dial\nback restriction, but we’re not quite at that point yet. We want to see more good data. The\ndecision was unanimous—all 19 participants supported it. But there was a real discussion back\nand forth of what the case would be for, for moving at this meeting. A strong majority supported\nPage 14 of 25\nJuly 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nmoving—not moving at this meeting. That was the strong sense of the Committee. But it’s a\nconversation that we had today, certainly.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Courtenay.\nCOURTENAY BROWN. Courtenay Brown from Axios. Thank you for taking our\nquestions. When the Fed was raising rates, there was a lot of conversation about long and\nvariable lags. I wonder if that applies on the way down, too. How are you and the Committee\nthinking about that?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes, it does. And I think the lags have kind of showed up here in the\nlast six months, by the way. You, you really do now see the restriction, whereas, I mean, even a\nfew months ago, people were questioning how restrictive policy was. Look at the labor market\nnow—you can see. And look at inflation—sorry—rate-sensitive, interest-sensitive spending.\nYou really do see now that policy is restrictive. I wouldn’t say it’s extremely restrictive, but it’s\ncertainly effectively restrictive. Yes, there—the lag should, should be on the way down. It\nshould take some time to get into—to get into the full economy, affect financial conditions. And\nthat affects economic activity, hiring and that kind of thing, and, ultimately, inflation. It\ndoesn’t—it’s not instantaneous, although it’s faster than it used to be because markets move now\nin anticipation of our moves.\nCOURTENAY BROWN. So are you worried then that if monetary policy acts with long\nand variable lags, even when you’re lowering interest rates, it might be too late for the Fed to\nhelp stave off any kind of slowdown in the labor market or broader economy?\nCHAIR POWELL. We have to worry about that. I mean, we—just to make it clear, you\nknow, it’s a very difficult, challenging judgment, and we don’t want to go too soon, and we don’t\nwant to go too late. But that’s—this is how we made that judgment. I feel good about where we\nPage 15 of 25\nJuly 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nare. We’re certainly very well positioned to respond to weakness with the policy rate at\n5.3 percent. We certainly have a lot of room to respond if we were to see weakness. That’s not\nwhat we’re seeing, though. What we’re seeing—look at the—look at the first-half growth\nnumbers. Look at PDFP at 2.6 percent for the first half. It’s not signaling a weak economy. It’s\nalso not signaling an overheating economy.\nLabor market—admittedly, the unemployment rate has moved up seven-tenths, and we’re\nseeing—we’re seeing normalization there, but wage, wage increases are still at a high level.\nUnemployment is still at a low level. Layoffs are very low. Initial claims have moved up, but\nthey’re pretty stable, and they’re historically not high at all. So the total scope of the data\nsuggests a normalizing labor market, and, again, we are carefully watching to see that that\ncontinues to be the case.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi. Victoria Guida with Politico. On the labor market, I was\nwondering, how worried are you all about unemployment rising to the point where it triggers the\nSahm rule, and would that potentially affect how quickly you cut rates?\nCHAIR POWELL. We—so I would just say, the question really is, is one of, are we\nworried about a sharper downturn in the labor market? So, and the answer is, we’re watching\nreally carefully for that. We’re, we’re aware of that rule, which is really a, you know, a—I\nwould call it a statistical, statistical thing that has happened through history. A “statistical\nregularity” is what I’d call it. It’s not like an economic rule where it’s telling you something\nmust happen.\nSo, again, what do we see? What are our eyes telling us? We look at—we look at all the\nthings we’re seeing, and what it looks like is a normalizing labor market—again, job creation at a\nPage 16 of 25\nJuly 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\npretty decent level, wages moving up at a strong level but coming down gradually. Job\nvacancies have come down, but they’re still high by historical standards. So, again, I’ve been\nthrough some of the data already, but what we think we’re seeing is, is a normalizing labor\nmarket, and we’re watching carefully to see if it—if it turns out to be more. If it starts to show\nsigns that it’s more than that, then we’re well positioned to respond.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Is there reason to think that the labor market might behave\ndifferently this time than it has historically?\nCHAIR POWELL. I think, you know, history doesn’t repeat itself; it rhymes. That\nstatement is very true about the economy. You never assume it’s going to be just the same. An\nexample would be, is there a trend increase in the level of vacancies? There are many, many\nexamples, so it’s never exactly the same. Also, let’s remember that this pandemic era has been\none in which so many, you know, apparent rules have been flouted, like the inverted yield curve\nfor starters. So, many, many received—pieces of received wisdom just haven’t worked, and it’s\nbecause this situation really is unusual or unique in that so much of this inflation came from the\nshutdown of the economy and the resulting supply problems in the face of, admittedly, very\nstrong demand. So the whole—the whole situation is not the same as many of the other prior\ninflation or downturns that we’ve seen or business cycles that we’ve seen. So we’re having to\nlearn. We’re having to, to be very careful about the judgments that we make, I would say. So\nwe don’t assume that these regularities will, will just repeat themselves automatically.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Amara.\nAMARA OMEOKWE. Thank you, Chair Powell. Amara Omeokwe with Bloomberg.\nThere seems to be quite a difference between what the anecdotal data are telling us, such as the\nvery recent downbeat Beige Book, and the hard data. Do you take those anecdotes seriously—\nPage 17 of 25\nJuly 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthat is, that the economy and labor market are cooling much more rapidly than what’s shown in\nthe data?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I do take that seriously, and the Beige Book is great. What’s even\ngreater is hearing the Reserve Bank presidents come in and talk about their conversations with,\nwith businesses and business leaders and workers and people in the nonprofit sector in their\nDistricts. But I’ll tell you, it’s a pretty—the picture is, is not one of a slowing or, you know, a\nreally bad economy. It’s one of there are spots of weakness, and there are regions where growth\nis stronger than other regions, but, overall, it’s—again, look at the aggregate data. The aggregate\ndata is—particularly PDFP, private domestic final purchases—is 2.6 percent, and that’s a good\nindicator of private—of private demand. So we listen to all of that, and it does, does—I think\nit’s important to listen to anecdotal data and not just look at the aggregate data. Especially, you\nknow, it’s very hard—GDP data can be volatile quarter to quarter. So it’s just hard to measure\neconomic activity. There are a lot of—it’s just difficult to do. So I look at both, but I wouldn’t\nsay that the—that the anecdotal data is uniformly downbeat. It’s more mixed.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jo Ling.\nJO LING KENT. Thank you. Jo Ling Kent with CBS News. Chair Powell, thanks for\ntaking our questions today. You have consistently said that the Fed does not consider politics in\nmaking decisions. With a possible September rate cut on the table, it would be less than two\nmonths before the election, and former President Trump reportedly said that cutting rates so\nclose to the election is something the central bank knows “they shouldn’t be doing.” What’s\nyour response, and do you believe it’s possible to really remain apolitical with a September rate\ncut?\nPage 18 of 25\nJuly 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. I absolutely do, and I think it’s—first of all, we haven’t made any\ndecisions. I would say it this way: haven’t made any decision about any future meeting. I don’t\nknow what the data will reveal or how that will affect the appropriate path of our policy. I really\ndon’t know. I do know how we will make that assessment. That’s what I do know.\nSo if you take a step back, the current situation, again, is inflation has come down much\ncloser to our goal, and that’s happened while unemployment has remained low. We’re, we’re\nvery tightly focused on using our tools to try to foster that state of affairs continuing. That’s at\neach of our meetings and all of our decisions, our focus is strictly on that and really on nothing\nelse—doing our part, whatever that part may be. You know, we’re using our best thinking.\nWe’re doing our best to understand the economy. We, we follow academics. We follow the\nmany commentators who bless us with their commentary [laughter], but we don’t change\nanything in our approach to address other factors, like the political calendar.\nCongress has, we believe, ordered us to conduct our business in a nonpolitical way at all\ntimes, not just some of the time. I’ll say this, too: We never use our tools to support or oppose a\npolitical party, a politician, or any political outcome. The bottom line is, if we do our very best\nto do our part and we stick to our part, that will benefit all Americans. If we get it right, the\neconomy will be stronger. We’ll have price stability. People will find jobs. Wages will rise in\nreal terms. Everyone will benefit. So that’s what we believe, and that’s how we will always act.\nThis is my fourth presidential election at the Fed. I can tell you this is how we think about it.\nThis is what we do. So anything that we do before, during, or after the election will be based on\nthe data, the outlook, and the balance of risks and not on anything else.\nPage 19 of 25\nJuly 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nJO LING KENT. Just a quick follow-up—do your economic forecasts and models take\ninto account the two very different economic plans of these two presidential candidates, Harris\nand Trump, and, if so, how?\nCHAIR POWELL. No. We do not do that. We absolutely do not do that. We don’t—\nwe don’t know who’s going to win. We don’t know what they’re going to do. We don’t act as\nthough we know, and we just can’t do that, you know? We basically—we have our forecast.\nWe’re not—we can run simulations of different potential policies, but we would never try to\nmake policy decisions based on the outcome of an election that hasn’t happened yet. We would\njust—that would just be a line we would never cross. You know, we’re a nonpolitical agency.\nWe don’t want to be involved in any—in politics in any way, so we wouldn’t do that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nicholas.\nNICHOLAS JASINSKI. Thank you, Chair Powell. Nicholas Jasinski from Barron’s\nMagazine. There hasn’t been a dissenting vote on an interest rate decision in some time. If the\ndata do evolve as you expect, if you do have more confidence by the September meeting, do you\nget the sense that there will be a unanimous vote on an interest rate move in September?\nBasically, are there meaningful differences in Committee members’ assessments of how much\nmore confidence is needed?\nCHAIR POWELL. So there’s—there are always meaningful differences. There are.\nAnd, you know, we talk a lot before, during, and after the meeting. We do have a very robust\ndiscussion of these things. You’re right that in, in most cases, people, if they feel heard and they\nfeel that they’ve—that their position has been given serious consideration, for most people, most\nof the time, that’s going to be enough. There are dissents. That’s fine. You know, no one has a\nveto. No single person has a veto, so it just is a question of, who will vote for and against?\nPage 20 of 25\nJuly 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nWe’ve had—we’ve had, you know, dissents. We haven’t had so many during the pandemic era,\nand it just may be that we, we felt more united because we felt under a lot of pressure to get\nthings right, but before the pandemic, we had plenty of dissents. And dissents happen. It’s part\nof the process. There’s nothing wrong with dissents, and if it happens, it happens.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jean.\nJEAN YUNG. Hello. Jean Yung with MNI Market News. Is a 50 basis point cut as a\nfirst cut at all likely or even on the table? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, I don’t want to say—I don’t want to be really specific\nabout what we’re going to do, but that’s, that’s not something we’re thinking about right now.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jennifer.\nCHAIR POWELL. Of course, we haven’t made any decisions at all as of today.\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. Thank you, Chair Powell. Jennifer Schonberger with\nYahoo Finance. Not to get into the minutes, but you said there was a real discussion today for\nmoving at this meeting. I’m curious if you could provide some more color on the nature of the\ndiscussion today at the meeting about a possible rate cut as early as September.\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, so, you know, the way the meeting is set up, the first day\nthere’s a discussion of financial stability because it’s every other meeting we have that, and then\nwe have an opportunity to comment on that. Then we have an economic go-round. And then,\nthis morning, we have the monetary policy go-round. And I think in people’s economic or in\ntheir monetary policy go-round, people express their views about this, and, you know, there’s a\nrange of views. People—as you will know from the speeches that they give—people have\ndifferent ways of thinking about the economy. And so, in the minutes, we’ll lay this out in a\nmuch—in a much better way than I can do off the cuff, but there’s a range of perspectives. And,\nPage 21 of 25\nJuly 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nyou know—but I do think that we are, we’re a consensus-driven organization. People come\ntogether. This was a unanimous—a unanimous decision. And, at the end, everyone, everyone\nsupported the outcome—not just the voters, but everyone. So I would also say, some people\nexamined the possibility, you know, the case for moving at this meeting, but, overwhelmingly,\nthe sense of the Committee was not at this meeting but as soon as the next meeting, depending\non how the data come in.\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. But there is a growing sense of confidence that you could\nmove at the next meeting—\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes.\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. —assuming inflation comes?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, assuming that the totality of the data supports such an\noutcome. No question. That’s, that is the case, as I mentioned. We think that the time is, is—\nit’s approaching, and if we do get the data that we—that we hope we get, then a reduction in our\npolicy rate could be on the table at the September meeting.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nancy.\nNANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Hi, Chair Powell. Nancy Marshall-Genzer with\nMarketplace. Former New York president Bill Dudley wrote an op-ed in Bloomberg earlier this\nmonth, which you probably saw, in which he said, “It might already be too late to fend off a\nrecession by cutting rates, dawdling now unnecessarily increases the risk.” Is he wrong?\nCHAIR POWELL. So this is the judgment that we have to make, and we’re, we’re well\naware of the judgment. We’re—as I’ve said, we have to weigh the risk of going too soon against\nthe risk of going too late. If we go too soon, we can—we had a lot of advice, you know, to go\nahead and cut after the seven good months of last year. We didn’t. We said we needed to see\nPage 22 of 25\nJuly 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nmore. Then we saw some higher inflation. We’ve seen one quarter of good inflation, and we’ve\nseen the labor market move quite a bit. And, as I mentioned, I don’t think it needs to cool off\nanymore for us to get the inflation results that are related to the labor market—not all inflation is,\nof course. So I think it’s a difficult judgment to make, and what you see is the judgment of the\nCommittee is that that time is drawing near. That time could be in September if, if the data\nsupport that.\nNANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. And have the chances of a hard landing increased?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I, I don’t know whether they’ve increased. I think they’re low. I\nthink this is—you don’t see any reason to think that this economy is either overheating or sharply\nweakening. That’s just not in the data right now. What’s in the data right now is an economy\nthat’s growing at a—at a solid pace, a labor market that has cooled off, but, nonetheless,\ninflation—sorry, unemployment is low. The data overall show a strong labor market. And so\nthat’s, that’s really what you see.\nIt’s not—it’s neither an overheating economy, nor is it a sharply weakening economy.\nIt’s, it’s kind of what you would want to see, but, of course, the job is never done. You know,\nwe’re, we’re watching to see, you know, which way the economy heads. And I think we’re—if\nwe are to respond to weakness, we’re certainly, you know, well equipped to do that. But that’s\nnot what we’re seeing. What we’re seeing is strong economic activity and, you know, a good\nlabor market and inflation coming down.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Greg.\nGREG ROBB. Thank you so much. In the—in the minutes of the June meeting that\ncame out a few weeks ago, there was a discussion about communications, and some Fed officials\nsaid maybe the Fed wasn’t as clear enough about its reaction function. And, and when I talked to\nPage 23 of 25\nJuly 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthe commentators who bless you with their comments [laughter], they say that they really don’t\nhave a sense of what is going to judge, maybe not the first cut, but the pace of the cuts going\nforward. They don’t have a good sense of that. Is there anything you can say, like how will we\njudge that?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah, I mean, I think the reality is that, that forecasters—and this\nisn’t just the Fed by any means—forecasters have been continually surprised by, for example, the\nstrength of the economy last year. So I think we had to be pretty humble about, about giving\nforward guidance about this, that, and the other thing. We need to be pretty careful about that.\nAnd, you know, when you’re saying you’re going to be data driven, of course, it’s always what\nthe data—how they affect the outlook and the balance of risks, but it’s—nobody has great vision\ndeep into the future.\nIn terms of a reaction function, that’s a—that’s a long-time discussion that people have\nhad forever. I think people have understood for a long time, actually, that we were very focused\non bringing down inflation. Nobody was really confused about that. The data have, you know—\nagain, we’ve seen significant improvement in inflation just for the last quarter. Markets move\naround on that—on the data, really. Not so much—it’s not really what we’re going to do. It’s\nmore just that the data keep coming in, and markets are very, very responsive to that data right\nnow.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Go to Jeff for the last question.\nJEFF COX. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’m going to change gears on you just a little bit\nfrom all of the rate talk and whatnot. With FedNow being in the books for a little over a year,\nthere hasn’t been a whole lot of talk about central bank digital currency and wondering if you\ncould give us an update on where things are with that. Is that considered a dead issue now? Is it\nPage 24 of 25\nJuly 31, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nstill something that’s being discussed within the Committee, and what, what’s happening with\nthat?\nCHAIR POWELL. It’s not something that comes up at all with the—in the FOMC. So,\nmore broadly, digital finance is an area that’s having—that has really significant implications for\npayments generally, instant payments. And, you know, it’s something that’s going to really\nchange the way—it’s going to make more efficient and, hopefully, safer and all those things—\nthe way payments are made around the world. And so we have people who are researching that\nand trying to keep up to speed, because we play an important role in the payments sector, both as\na convener and as an operator, too.\nIn terms of a CBDC, there’s really nothing new going on. There’s not much going on at\nall. We’re not—we don’t have the authority to issue a CB—a retail CBDC that’s available to the\npublic. We’re not seeking that authority. So what we’re doing is keeping up with—keeping up\nwith developments there. Pretty much every major central bank in the world is at least doing,\ndoing that. Some of them are actually seriously looking at implementing a CBDC. We’re really\nnot. We’re really just evaluating, you know, the story and what’s happening out there. So I\nthink it’s work that we need to be doing, which could be very beneficial down the road, but we\ndon’t have—on a CBDC, we don’t have any plan to. We would need to go to Congress, and we\nhave no plan to do that. We’re not—no one here has decided that we think it’s a good idea yet.\nThank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you.\nPage 25 of 25"

    "press_conf": "September 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nTranscript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference\nSeptember 18, 2024\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on\nachieving our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of\nthe American people. Our economy is strong overall and has made significant progress toward\nour goals over the past two years. The labor market has cooled from its formerly overheated\nstate. Inflation has eased substantially from a peak of 7 percent to an estimated 2.2 percent as of\nAugust. We’re committed to maintaining our economy’s strength by supporting maximum\nemployment and returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.\nToday, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to reduce the degree of policy\nrestraint by lowering our policy interest rate by ½ percentage point. This decision reflects our\ngrowing confidence that with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, strength in the\nlabor market can be maintained in a context of moderate growth and inflation moving\nsustainably down to 2 percent. We also decided to continue to reduce our securities holdings. I\nwill have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.\nRecent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid\npace. GDP rose at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the first half of the year, and available data\npoint to a roughly similar pace of growth this quarter. Growth of consumer spending has\nremained resilient, and investment in equipment and intangibles has picked up from its anemic\npace last year. In the housing sector, investment fell back in the second quarter after rising\nstrongly in the first. Improving supply conditions have supported resilient demand and the\nstrong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year. In our Summary of Economic\nProjections, Committee participants generally expect GDP growth to remain solid, with a median\nprojection of 2 percent over the next few years.\nPage 1 of 26\nSeptember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nIn the labor market, conditions have continued to cool. Payroll job gains averaged\n116,000 per month over the past three months, a notable step-down from the pace seen earlier in\nthe year. The unemployment rate has moved up but remains low at 4.2 percent. Nominal wage\ngrowth has eased over the past year, and the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed. Overall, a broad\nset of indicators suggests that conditions in the labor market are now less tight than just before\nthe pandemic in 2019. The labor market is not a source of elevated inflationary pressures. The\nmedian projection for the unemployment rate in the SEP is 4.4 percent at the end of this year,\nfour-tenths higher than projected in June.\nInflation has eased notably over the past two years but remains above our longer-run goal\nof 2 percent. Estimates based on the consumer price index and other data indicate that total PCE\nprices rose 2.2 percent over the 12 months ending in August and that, excluding the volatile food\nand energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.7 percent. Longer-term inflation expectations\nappear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households,\nbusinesses, and forecasters as well as measures from financial markets. The median projection\nin the SEP for total PCE inflation is 2.3 percent this year and 2.1 percent next year, somewhat\nlower than projected in June. Thereafter, the median projection is 2 percent.\nOur monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people. For much of the past three years,\ninflation ran well above our 2 percent goal, and labor market conditions were extremely\ntight. Our primary focus had been on bringing down inflation, and appropriately so. We are\nacutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power,\nespecially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and\ntransportation.\nPage 2 of 26\nSeptember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nOur restrictive monetary policy has helped restore the balance between aggregate supply\nand demand, easing inflationary pressures and ensuring that inflation expectations remain well\nanchored. Our patient approach over the past year has paid dividends: Inflation is now much\ncloser to our objective, and we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving\nsustainably toward 2 percent.\nAs inflation has declined and the labor market has cooled, the upside risks to inflation\nhave diminished, and the downside risks to employment have increased. We now see the risks to\nachieving our employment and inflation goals as roughly in balance, and we are attentive to the\nrisks to both sides of our dual mandate.\nIn light of the progress on inflation and the balance of risks, at today’s meeting, the\nCommittee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by ½ percentage point to\n4¾ percent to 5 percent. This recalibration of our policy stance will help maintain the strength of\nthe economy and the labor market and will continue to enable further progress on inflation as we\nbegin the process of moving toward a more neutral stance. We are not on any preset course. We\nwill continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting.\nWe know that reducing policy restraint too quickly could hinder progress on inflation. At\nthe same time, reducing restraint too slowly could unduly weaken economic activity and\nemployment. In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate,\nthe Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of\nrisks.\nIn our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an\nappropriate path for the federal funds rate, based on what each participant judges to be the most\nlikely scenario going forward. If the economy evolves as expected, the median participant\nPage 3 of 26\nSeptember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nprojects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 4.4 percent at the end of this\nyear and 3.4 percent at the end of 2025. These median projections are lower than in June,\nconsistent with the projections for lower inflation and higher unemployment, as well as the\nchanged balance of risks. These projections, however, are not a Committee plan or decision.\nAs the economy evolves, monetary policy will adjust in order to best promote our\nmaximum-employment and price-stability goals. If the economy remains solid and inflation\npersists, we can dial back policy restraint more slowly. If the labor market were to weaken\nunexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we are prepared to\nrespond. Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in\npursuing both sides of our dual mandate.\nThe Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy—maximum employment and\nstable prices. We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation\nback down to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.\nOur success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans. We understand that our\nactions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in\nservice to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-\nemployment and price-stability goals.\nThank you. I look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking our\nquestions. In July, you said you weren’t necessarily thinking about a 50. You didn’t want to be\nspecific, but you said you weren’t thinking about a 50. The inflation data last week came out a\nlittle firmer than expected. Retail was strong, third-quarter GDP running 3 percent. So what\nPage 4 of 26\nSeptember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nchanged that made the Committee go 50, and how do you respond to the concerns that perhaps it\nshows the Fed is more concerned about the labor market? And I guess, should we expect more\n50s in the months ahead? And based on what should we make that call? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So, okay, a lot of questions in there. [Laughter] Let me jump in. So,\nsince the last meeting—okay, the last meeting we have had a lot of data come in. We’ve had the\ntwo employment reports, July and August. We’ve also had two inflation reports, including one\nthat came in during blackout. We had the QCEW report, which suggests that maybe—that not\nmaybe, but suggests that the payroll report numbers that we’re getting may be artificially high\nand will be revised down. You know that. We’ve also seen anecdotal data, like [the data\ncollected in] the Beige Book. So we took all of those, and we went into blackout. And we\nthought about what to do, and we concluded that this was the right thing for the economy, for the\npeople that we serve, and that’s, that’s how we made our decision. So that’s one question. What\nwas the second and third?\nSTEVE LIESMAN. How do we make the—sorry, thank you, sir. How do we figure out\nin the months ahead, is there another 25 or 50 coming in based on what should we make that\ncall? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So a couple things. A good place to start is the—is the SEP,\nbut let me start with what I said, which was that we’re going to be making decisions meeting by\nmeeting based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook, the balance of risks. If you look at\nthe SEP, you’ll, you’ll see that it’s, it’s a process of recalibrating our policy stance away from\nwhere we had it a year ago, when inflation was high and unemployment low, to a place that’s\nmore appropriate given where we are now and where we expect to be. And that process will take\nplace over time. There’s nothing in the—in the SEP that suggests the Committee is in a rush to\nPage 5 of 26\nSeptember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nget this done. This, this process evolves over time. Of course, that’s a projection. That’s a\nbaseline projection. We know, as I mentioned in my remarks, that the actual things that we do\nwill depend on the way the economy evolves. We can go quicker if that’s appropriate. We can\ngo slower if that’s appropriate. We can pause if that’s appropriate. But that’s, that’s what we are\ncontemplating. Again, I would point you to the SEP as just an assessment of where—what the\nCommittee is thinking today—what the individual members, rather, of the Committee are\nthinking today, assuming that their particular forecasts take—you know, are realized.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Chris.\nCHRIS RUGABER. Hi. Chris Rugaber at Associated Press. Thank you. The\nprojections show that the Fed—Fed officials expect the fed funds rate to still be above their\nestimate of long-run neutral by the end of next year. So does that suggest that you see rates as\nrestrictive for that entire period? Does that threaten the weakening of the job market that you\nsaid you’d like to avoid? Or does it suggest that maybe people see the short-run neutral as a little\nbit higher? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. I think it would—the way I would really characterize it is this: I\nthink people write down their estimate, individuals do. I think every single person on the\nCommittee, if you asked them, what’s your level of certainty around that, they would say there’s\na wide range where that could fall. So I think we don’t know. There are model-based\napproaches and empirically based approaches that estimate what the neutral rate will be at any\ngiven time. But, realistically, we know it by its works. So that leaves us in a place where we’ll\nbe—where we expect, in the base case, to be continuing to remove restriction, and we’ll be\nlooking at the way the economy reacts to that. And that’ll be guiding us in our thinking about the\nquestion that we’re asking at every meeting, which is, is our policy stance the appropriate one?\nPage 6 of 26\nSeptember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nWe know—if you go back, we know that the policy stance we adopted in July of 2023 came at a\ntime when unemployment was 3½ percent and inflation was 4.2 percent. Today, unemployment\nis up to 4.2 percent; inflation’s down to a few tenths above 2. So we know that it is time to\nrecalibrate our policy to something that is more appropriate given the progress on inflation and\non employment moving to a more sustainable level. So the balance of risks are now even. And\nthis is the beginning of that process I mentioned, the direction of which is toward a sense of\nneutral, and we’ll move as fast or as slow as we think is appropriate in real time. What you have\nis our individual—accumulation of individual estimates of what that will be in the base case.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Howard.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Howard Schneider with Reuters. How close was this in terms\nof the decision? You do have the first dissent by a Governor since 2005, I think. Was the weight\nclearly in favor of a 50, or was this a very close decision?\nCHAIR POWELL. I think we had a good—a good discussion. You know, if you go\nback, I talked about this at Jackson Hole, but I didn’t address the question of the size of the cut\nand left it open, and I think we left it open going into blackout. And so there was a lot of\ndiscussion back and forth, good diversity of—excellent discussion today. I think there was also\nbroad support for the decision that the Committee voted on. So I would add, though, look at the\nSEP. All 19 of the participants wrote down multiple cuts this year. All 19. That’s a big change\nfrom June, right? Seven of the—seven of them wrote down three or more and—sorry, 17 of the\n19 wrote down three or more cuts, and 10 of the 19 wrote down four or more cuts. So, you\nknow, there is a dissent, and there’s a range of views, but there’s actually a lot of common\nground as well.\nPage 7 of 26\nSeptember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Follow-up to that. Now that this is in the books, can you give\nus some guidance as sort of a follow-up to Steve on the pacing here? Would you expect this to\nbe running every other meeting once we get into next year?\nCHAIR POWELL. We’re going to take it meeting by meeting, as I mentioned. There’s\nno sense that the Committee feels it’s in a rush to do this. We made a good, strong start to this,\nand that’s really, frankly, a sign of our confidence—confidence that inflation is, is coming down\ntoward 2 percent on a sustainable basis. That gives us the ability. We can, you know, make a\ngood, strong start. But—and I’m very pleased that we did. To me, the logic of this, both from an\neconomic standpoint and also from a risk-management standpoint, was clear. But I think we’re\ngoing to go carefully, meeting by meeting, and make our decisions as we go.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jeanna.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Chair Powell. Jeanna Smialek, New York Times. Thanks for\ntaking our questions. You and your colleagues in your economic projections today see the\nunemployment rate climbing to 4.4 percent and staying there. Obviously, historically, when the\nunemployment rate climbs that much over a relatively short period of time, it doesn’t typically\njust stop—it continues increasing. And so I wonder if you can walk us through why you see the\nlabor market stabilizing, sort of what’s the mechanism there? And what do you see as the risks?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, again, the labor market is actually in solid condition, and our\nintention with our policy move today is to keep it there. You can say that about the whole\neconomy. The U.S. economy is in good shape. It’s growing at a solid pace, inflation is coming\ndown, the labor market is in a strong pace, we want to keep it there. That’s, that’s what we’re\ndoing.\nPage 8 of 26\nSeptember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMICHELLE SMITH. Sorry—Nick.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, does today’s\naction constitute a catch-up in action given recent substantial revisions to the employment data,\nor is this larger-than-typical rate cut a function of the elevated nominal level of the policy rate\nsuch that an accelerated cadence could be expected to continue?\nCHAIR POWELL. Okay, multiple questions in there. So I would say we don’t think\nwe’re behind. We do not think—we think this is timely, but I think you can take this as a sign of\nour commitment not to get behind. So it’s, it’s a strong move. Sorry, your other question was?\nNICK TIMIRAOS. It was, is this about what happened in the employment data between\nthis meeting and the last meeting? Or is this about the level of the funds rate—the high nominal\nlevel of funds rate relative to what might be expected if you’re trying to maintain equilibrium?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think it’s about—we come into this with a policy position that\nwas put in place, as you know, I mentioned, in July of 2023, which was a time of high inflation\nand very low unemployment. We’ve been very patient about, about reducing the policy rate.\nWe’ve waited. Other central banks around the world have cut, many of them several times.\nWe’ve waited, and I think that that patience has really paid dividends in the form of our\nconfidence that inflation is moving sustainably under 2 percent. So I think that is what enables\nus to take this, this strong move today. I do not think that anyone should look at this and say,\n“Oh, this is the new pace.” You know, you have to think about it in terms of the base case. Of\ncourse, what happens will happen. So, so, in the base case, what you see is—look at the SEP,\nyou see cuts moving along. The sense of this is we’re recalibrating policy down over time to a\nmore neutral level. And we’re moving at the pace that we think is appropriate given\nPage 9 of 26\nSeptember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ndevelopments in the economy and the base case. The economy can develop in a way that would\ncause us to go faster or slower, but that’s what the base case is.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. And, if I could follow up on the balance sheet, in 2019, when you\ndid the mid-cycle adjustment, you ceased the balance sheet runoff. With a larger cut today, is\nthere any—should there be any signal inferred about how the Committee would approach “end\nstate” on the balance sheet policy?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, in the current situation, reserves have really been stable. They\nhaven’t come down. So reserves are still abundant and expected to remain so for some time. As\nyou know, the shrinkage in our balance sheet has really come out of the overnight RRP [facility].\nSo I think what that tells you is, we’re not thinking about, about stopping runoff because of this\nat all. We know that these two things can happen side by side. In a sense, they’re both a form of\nnormalization, and so, for a time, you can have the balance sheet shrinking but also be cutting\nrates.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Colby.\nCOLBY SMITH. Thank you. Colby Smith with the Financial Times. Just following up\non Jeanna’s question on rising unemployment. Is it your view that this is just a function of a\nnormalizing labor market amid improved supply, or is there anything to suggest that something\nmore concerning perhaps is taking place here, given that other metrics of labor demand have\nsoftened too? And I guess, in direct follow-up to Jeanna, do you not—why should we not expect\na further deterioration in labor market conditions if policy is still restrictive?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think what we’re seeing is, clearly labor market conditions have\ncooled off by any measure, as I talked about in Jackson Hole, and—but they’re still at a level—\nthe level of those conditions is actually pretty close to what I would call maximum employment.\nPage 10 of 26\nSeptember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nSo you’re close to mandate, maybe at mandate, on that. So what’s driving it? Clearly, clearly\npayroll job creation has moved down over the last few months, and this bears watching. Many—\nBy many other measures, the labor market has returned to or below 2019 levels, which was a\nvery good, strong labor market, but this is more sort of 2018, ’17. So the labor market bears\nclose—bears close watching, and we’ll be giving it that. But ultimately, we think—we believe,\nwith an appropriate recalibration of our policy, that we can continue to see the economy growing,\nand that will support the labor market. In the meantime, if you look at the growth in economic\nactivity data, retail sales data that we just got, second-quarter GDP—all of this indicates an\neconomy that is still growing at a solid pace. So that should also support the labor market over\ntime. So—but again, we’re—it bears watching. And we’re watching.\nCOLBY SMITH. And just on the point about starting to see rising layoffs, if that were to\nhappen, wouldn’t the Committee already be too late in terms of avoiding a recession?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we’re—that’s—you know, our plan, of course, has been to begin\nto recalibrate and we’re—as you know, we’re not seeing rising claims, we’re not seeing rising\nlayoffs, we’re not seeing that, and we’re not hearing that from companies that that’s something\nthat’s getting ready to happen. So we’re not waiting for that, because, you know, there is—there\nis thinking that the time to support the labor market is when—is when it’s strong and not when\nwe begin to see the layoffs. There’s some lore on that. So that’s the situation we’re in. We have,\nin fact, begun the cutting cycle now, and we’ll be watching—and that’ll be one of the factors that\nwe consider. Of course, we’re going to look at the totality of the data as we make these decisions\nmeeting by meeting.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Michael McKee.\nPage 11 of 26\nSeptember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee with Bloomberg TV and Radio. To follow up on\nthat, what would constitute for you and the Committee a deterioration in the labor market?\nYou’re pricing in, basically by the end of next year, 200 basis points of cuts just to maintain a\nhigher unemployment rate. Would you be moving to a more preemptive monetary policy style—\nrather than, as you did with inflation, waiting until the data gave you a signal?\nCHAIR POWELL. We’re going to be watching all of the data, right? So if—as I\nmentioned in my remarks, if the labor market were to slow unexpectedly, then we have the\nability to react to that by, by cutting faster. We’re also going to be looking at our other mandate,\nthough. We are more—we have greater confidence now that inflation is moving down to\n2 percent, but, at the same time, our plan is that we will be at 2 percent, you know, over time.\nSo—and policy, we think, is still restrictive, so that should still be happening.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. I’m just curious as to how sensitive you’ll be to the labor market,\nsince you forecast we are going to see higher unemployment and it is going to take a significant\namount of monetary easing to just maintain it.\nCHAIR POWELL. So, you know, what I would say is, we don’t think we need to see\nfurther loosening in labor market conditions to get inflation down to 2 percent. But we have a\ndual mandate, and I think you can take this whole action as—take a step back, what have we\nbeen trying to achieve? We’re trying to achieve a situation where we restore price stability\nwithout the kind of painful increase in unemployment that has come sometimes with disinflation.\nThat’s what we’re trying to do. And I think you can take today’s action as a sign of our strong\ncommitment to achieve that goal.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Rachel.\nPage 12 of 26\nSeptember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Hi, Chair Powell. Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. Thanks\nfor taking our questions. You’re describing this view that you don’t think you’re behind when it\ncomes to the job market. Can you walk us through the specific data points that you found to be\nmost helpful in the discussions at this meeting? You’ve mentioned a couple, but would you be\nable to walk us through what that dashboard told you, as far as what you know about the job\nmarket now?\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So we’ll start with unemployment, which is the single most\nimportant one probably. You’re at 4.2 percent. That’s, you know—I know it’s higher than we\nwere used to seeing, numbers in the mid- and even below mid-3s last year, but, if you look back\nover the sweep of the years, that’s, that’s a low. That’s a very healthy unemployment rate. And\nanything in the low 4s is, is a really—is a good labor market. So that’s one thing. Participation\nis at high levels. It’s, you know—we’ve had—we’re right—adjusted for demographics for\naging, participation’s at pretty high levels. That’s a good thing. Wages are still a bit above what\nwould be their—wage increases, rather, are still just a bit above where they would be over the\nvery longer term to be consistent with 2 percent inflation, but they’re very much coming down to\nwhat that sustainable level is. So we feel good about that. Vacancies over—per unemployed is\nback to what is still a very strong level. It’s not as high as it was. That number reached two to\none, two vacancies for every unemployed person. As measured, it’s now below—it’s around\none. But that’s still—that’s still a very good number, I would say. You know, quits have come\nback down to normal levels. I mean, I could go on and on. There are many, many employment\nindicators. What do they say? They say this is still a solid labor market. The question isn’t the\nlevel; the question is that there has been change, particularly over the last few months, and, you\nknow, so what we say is, as the risks, the upside risks, to inflation have really come down, the\nPage 13 of 26\nSeptember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ndownside risks to employment have increased. And, and because we have been patient and held\nour fire on cutting while, while inflation has come down, I think we’re now in a very good\nposition to manage the risks to both of our goals.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. And what do you expect to learn between now and November that\nwill help inform the scale of the cut at the next meeting?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, more data, the usual. Don’t look for anything else. We’ll\nsee another labor report. We’ll see another jobs report. I think we get a—we might, actually—\nwe get two—we get a second jobs report on the day of the meeting, I think, or no, no, on the\nFriday before the meeting. So—and inflation data. We’ll get all this data. We’ll be watching.\nYou know, it’s always a question of, look at the incoming data and ask what are the implications\nof that data for the evolving outlook and the balance of risks and then go through our process and\nthink, what’s the right thing to do? Is policy where we want it to be to foster the achievement of\nour goals over time? So that’s what it is, and that’s what we’ll be doing.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Neil.\nNEIL IRWIN. Thanks. Hi, Chair Powell. Neil Irwin with Axios. We’ve only been\nrunning a little above 100,000 jobs a month on payroll the last three months. Do you view that\nlevel of job creation as worrying or alarming, or would you be—would you be content if we\nwere to kind of stick at that level? And relatedly, you know, one of the welcome trends of the\nlast couple of years has been labor markets seen coming out through job openings falling, rather\nthan job losses. Do you think that trend has further to run, or do you see risk that further labor\nmarket cooling will have to come through job losses?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, on the job creation, it depends on—it depends on the inflows,\nright? So, if you’re having millions of people come into the labor force then, and you’re creating\nPage 14 of 26\nSeptember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\n100,000 jobs, you’re going to see unemployment go up. So it really depends on what’s the trend\nunderlying the volatility of people coming into the country. We understand there’s been quite an\ninflux across the borders, and that has actually been one of the things that’s, that’s, that’s allowed\nthe unemployment rate to rise. And the other thing is just the slower hiring rate, which is\nsomething we also watch carefully. So it does depend on what’s happening on the supply side.\nOn the Beveridge curve question, yes, so we all felt, on the Committee, not all, but I think\neveryone on the Committee felt that job openings were so elevated that they could fall a long\nway before you hit the part of the curve where job openings turned into higher unemployment,\njob loss. And yes, I mean, I think we are—it’s hard to know that—you can’t know these things\nwith great precision, but certainly it appears that we’re very close to that point, if not at it, so that\nfurther declines in job openings will translate more directly into unemployment. But it’s been—\nit’s been a great ride down. I mean, we’ve seen a lot of, of tightness come out of the labor\nmarket in that form without it resulting in lower employment.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Edward.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thanks, Chair Powell. Edward Lawrence with Fox Business.\nSo we’ve heard some speculation that you may be going with the federal funds rate to 3½,\nmaybe under 4 percent. There’s basically an entire generation that has experienced zero or near-\nzero federal funds rate, and some think we’re heading in that direction again. What’s the\nlikelihood that cheap money is now the norm?\nCHAIR POWELL. So this is a question—and you mean after we get through all of this?\nIt’s just—great question that we just, we can only speculate about. Intuitively, most—many,\nmany people anyway, would say we’re probably not going back to that era where there were\ntrillions of dollars of sovereign bonds trading at negative rates—long-term bonds trading at\nPage 15 of 26\nSeptember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nnegative rates. And it looked like the neutral rate was—might even be negative, so—and it\nwas—people were issuing debt at negative rates. It seems that’s so far away now. My own sense\nis that we’re not going back to that. But, you know, honestly, we’re going to find out. But, you\nknow, it feels—it feels to me that the neutral rate is probably significantly higher than it was\nback then. How high is it? I don’t—I just don’t think we know. It’s—again, we only know it by\nits works.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. And one more, how do you respond to the criticism that will\nlikely come that a deeper rate cut now, before the election, has some political motivations?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah, so, you know, this is my fourth presidential election at the Fed,\nand, you know, it’s always the same. We’re always—we’re always going into this meeting, in\nparticular, and asking, what’s the right thing to do for the people we serve? And we do that, and\nwe make a decision as a group, and then we announce it. And it’s—that’s always what it is. It’s\nnever about anything else. Nothing else is discussed, and I would also point out that the things\nthat we do really affect economic conditions for the most part with a lag. So, nonetheless, this is\nwhat we do. Our job is to support the economy on behalf of the American people. And, if we\nget it right, this will benefit the American people significantly. So this really concentrates the\nmind, and, you know, it’s something we all take very, very seriously. We don’t put up any other\nfilters. I think if you start doing that, I don’t know where you stop. And so we just don’t do that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jo Ling.\nJO LING KENT. Thank you, Chair Powell. I’m Jo Ling Kent with CBS News. My first\nquestion is, very simply, what message are you trying to send American consumers, the\nAmerican people, with this unusually large rate cut?\nPage 16 of 26\nSeptember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. I would just say that, you know, the U.S. economy is in a good place,\nand, and our decision today is designed to keep it there. More specifically, the economy is\ngrowing at a solid pace, inflation is coming down closer to our 2 percent objective over time, and\nthe labor market is still in solid shape. So our intention is really to maintain the strength that we\ncurrently see in the U.S. economy. And we’ll do that by returning rates from their high level,\nwhich has really been—the purpose of which has been to get inflation under control. We’re,\nwe’re going to move those down over time to a more normal level over time.\nJO LING KENT. Just have a follow-up to that. Listening to you talk about inflation\nmoving meaningfully down to 2 percent, is the Federal Reserve effectively declaring a decisive\nvictory over inflation and rising prices?\nCHAIR POWELL. No, we’re not. So inflation, you know—what we say is we want\ninflation—the goal is to have inflation move down to 2 percent on a sustainable basis. And, you\nknow, we’re not really—we’re close, but we’re not really at 2 percent. And I think we’re going\nto want to see it be, you know, around 2 percent and close to 2 percent for some time, but we’re\ncertainly not doing—we’re not saying “mission accomplished” or anything like that. But I have\nto say, though, we’re encouraged by the progress that we have made.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Catarina.\nCATARINA SARAIVA. Hi. Catarina Saraiva with Bloomberg News. I just would love\nto know kind of how the Committee is thinking about the persistence we’ve seen in housing\ninflation. You know, do you think you can return to 2 percent with housing inflation where it is?\nYeah.\nCHAIR POWELL. So housing inflation is the—is the one piece that is kind of dragging\na bit, if I can say. We know that market rents are doing what we would want them to do, which\nPage 17 of 26\nSeptember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nis to be moving up at relatively low levels, but they’re not rolling over—the leases that are\nrolling over are not coming down as much and OER is coming in high. So, you know, it’s been\nslower than we expected. I think we now understand that it’s going to take some time for those\nlower market rents to get into this. But, you know, the direction of travel is clear, and as long as\nmarket rents remain, you know, relatively low inflation, over time that will show up, just the time\nit’s taking now, several years rather than just one or two cycles of annual lease renewals. So\nthat’s—I think we understand that now, but I don’t think the outcome is in doubt again. As long\nas market rents remain under control, the outcome is not as in doubt. So I would say it’s—the\nrest of the portfolio—or of the elements that go into core PCE inflation have behaved pretty well.\nYou know, they’re all—they all have some volatility. We will get down to 2 percent inflation, I\nbelieve, and I believe that, ultimately, we’ll get what we need to get out of the housing services\npiece, too.\nCATARINA SARAIVA. Some of your colleagues have expressed concern that, with\nstarting to cut rates, you could re-ignite demand in housing and see prices go up even more.\nWhat’s the likelihood of that, and how would you react to that?\nCHAIR POWELL. The housing market, it’s hard to—it’s a game that—the housing\nmarket is in part frozen because of lock-in with low rates. People don’t want to sell their homes.\nSo, because they have a very low mortgage, it would be quite expensive to refinance. As rates\ncome down, people will start to move more, and that’s probably beginning to happen already.\nBut remember, when that happens, you’ve got a seller, but you’ve also got a new buyer in many\ncases. So it’s not, you know, obvious how much additional demand that would make. I mean,\nthe real issue with housing is that we have had, and are on track to continue to have, not enough\nhousing. And so it’s going to be challenging. It’s hard to find—to zone lots that are in places\nPage 18 of 26\nSeptember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nwhere people want to live. It’s—all of the aspects of housing are more and more difficult, and,\nyou know, where are we going to get the supply? And this is not something that the Fed can, can\nreally fix. But I think, as we normalize rates, you’ll see the housing market normalize. And, I\nmean, ultimately by getting inflation broadly down and getting those rates normalized and\ngetting the housing cycle normalized, that’s the best thing we can do for house holders. And then\nthe supply question will have to be dealt with by the market and also by government.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi. Victoria Guida with Politico. Just following up on some of the\nlabor market talk earlier, you know, monetary policy operates with long and variable lags, and\nI’m wondering how much you see being able to keep the unemployment rate from raising too\nmuch comes from the fact that you’re starting to act now and that’s going to give people more\nroom to run versus just the labor market is strong. And then, also, if I could, following up on\nNick’s question, do you see today’s 50 basis point move as partially a response to the fact that\nyou didn’t cut in July and that sort of gets you to the same place?\nCHAIR POWELL. So you’re right about lags, but I would just point to the overall\neconomy. You have an economy that is growing at a solid pace. If you look at forecasters or\ntalk to companies, they’ll say that they think 2025 should be a good year, too. So there’s no\nsense—the U.S. economy is basically fine if you talk to market participants, I mean, you know,\nbusiness people who are actually out there doing business. So I think, you know, I think our\nmove is timely. I do. And, as I said, you can—you can see our, our 50 basis point move as a\ncommitment to make sure that we don’t fall behind.\nSo you’re really asking about—your second question, you’re asking about July. And I\nguess if you ask if we’d gotten the July report before the meeting, would we have cut? We might\nPage 19 of 26\nSeptember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nwell have. We didn’t make that decision, but we might well have. I think that’s not—you know,\nthat doesn’t really answer the question that we ask ourselves, which is, let’s look, you know—at\nthis meeting we’re looking back to the July employment report, the August employment report,\nthe two CPI reports, one of which came, of course, during blackout, and all of the other things\nthat I mentioned. We’re looking at all of those things, and we’re asking ourselves, what’s the\nright—what’s the policy stance we need to move to? We knew—it’s clear that we—clearly,\nliterally, everyone on the Committee agreed that it’s time to move. It’s just how big—how fast\ndo you go, and what do you think about the paths forward. So this decision we made today had\nbroad support on the Committee, and I’ve discussed the path ahead.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Elizabeth.\nELIZABETH SCHULZE. Thank you, Chair Powell. Elizabeth Schulze with ABC\nNews. Mortgage rates have already been dropping in anticipation of this announcement. How\nmuch more should borrowers expect those rates to drop over the next year?\nCHAIR POWELL. Very hard for me to say. That’s—from our standpoint, I can’t really\nspeak to mortgage rates. I will say that’ll depend on how the economy evolves. Our intention,\nthough, is—we think that our policy was appropriately restrictive. We think that it’s time to\nbegin the process of recalibrating it to a level that’s more neutral, rather than restrictive. We\nexpect that process to take some time, as you can see in the projections that we released today.\nAnd as—if things work out according to that forecast, other rates in the economy will come\ndown as well. However, the rate at which those things happen will really depend on how the\neconomy performs. We can’t see—we can’t look a year ahead and know what the economy is to\nbe doing—going to be doing.\nPage 20 of 26\nSeptember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nELIZABETH SCHULZE. What’s your message to households who are frustrated that\nhome prices have still stayed so high as rates have been high? What do you say to those\nhouseholds?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, what I can say to the public is that we had the highest—we had\na burst of inflation. Many other countries around the world had a similar burst of inflation, and,\nwhen that happens, part of the answer is that we raise interest rates in order to cool the economy\noff in order to reduce inflationary pressures. It’s not something that people experience as\npleasant, but, at the end, what you get is low inflation restored, price stability restored. And a\ngood definition of price stability is that people in their daily decisions, they’re not thinking about\ninflation anymore. That’s where everyone wants to be, is back to what’s inflation, you know?\nJust keep it low, keep it stable. We’re restoring that. So what we’re going through now really\nrestores—it will benefit people over a long period of time. Price stability benefits everybody\nover a long period of time, just by virtue of the fact that they don’t have to deal with inflation.\nSo that’s what’s been going on, and I think we’ve made real progress. I completely—we don’t\ntell people how to think about the economy, of course. And, of course, people are [still]\nexperiencing high prices, as opposed to high inflation. And we understand that’s painful.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Greg.\nGREG ROBB. Hi, Chair Powell. Greg Robb from Marketwatch.com. I was wondering\nif you could go through—you said just at the beginning that, coming into the blackout, there was\nlike an open thought of 25 or 50—you know, the Fed could move either 25 or 50. I would sort of\nargue that when we had those two last speeches by Governor Waller and New York Fed President\nJohn Williams, that they were sort of saying that maybe a gradual approach was going to win the\nday. I mean, I sort of want to ask a seven-part question about this. But, I mean, could you talk—\nPage 21 of 26\nSeptember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nwould you have cut rates by 50 basis points if the market had been pricing in, like, low odds of a\n50 point move like they were last Wednesday, you know, after the CPI number came out? It was\na really small probability of a 50 point cut. Does that play in your consideration at all? Just talk\na little bit about that. Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. We’re always going to try to do what we think is the right thing for\nthe economy at that time. That’s what we’ll do. And that’s what we did today.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Simon.\nSIMON RABINOVITCH. Thank you, Chair Powell. Simon Rabinovitch with the\nEconomist. You’ve mentioned how closely you’re watching the labor market, but you also noted\nthat payroll numbers have been a little bit less reliable lately because of the big downward\nrevisions. Does that put your focus overwhelmingly on the unemployment rate? And given the\nSEP projection of 4.4 [percent] basically being the peak in the cycle, would going above that be\nthe kind of thing that would trigger another 50 basis point cut?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we will continue to look at that broad array of labor market data,\nincluding the payroll numbers. We’re not discarding those. I mean, we’ll certainly look at those,\nbut we will mentally tend to adjust them based on the QCEW adjustment, which you referred to.\nThere isn’t a bright line. You know, it will be—the unemployment rate’s very important, of\ncourse, but there isn’t a single statistic or single bright line over which that thing that might move\nthat would dictate one thing or another. We’ll look at—each meeting, we’ll look at all the data\non inflation, economic activity, and the labor market, and we’ll make decisions about, is our\npolicy stance where it needs to be to foster over the medium term our mandate goals? So I\ncan’t—I can’t say we have a bright line in mind.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Matt Egan.\nPage 22 of 26\nSeptember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMATT EGAN. Thanks, Chair Powell. Matt Egan from CNN. I know that you discussed\nearlier how the Fed does whatever the right thing is and nothing else factors in. But, in general,\ncan you talk about whether or not you believe a sitting U.S. president should have a say in Fed\ndecisions on interest rates? Because that’s something that former President Trump, who\nobviously appointed you, has previously suggested. And I know the Fed is designed to be\nindependent, but why? Can you tell the public why you view that as so important?\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So countries that are—democracies around the world,\ncountries that are sort of like the United States, all have what are called independent central\nbanks. And the reason is that people have found over time that insulating the central bank from\ndirect control by political authorities avoids making monetary policy in a way that favors maybe\npeople who are in office as opposed to people who are not in office. So that’s the idea, is that—\nyou know, I think the data are clear that countries that have independent central banks, they get\nlower inflation. And so we’re, we’re not—we do our work to serve all Americans. We’re not\nserving any politician, any political figure, any cause, any issue, nothing. It’s just maximum\nemployment and price stability on behalf of all Americans. And that’s how the other central\nbanks are set up, too. It’s a good institutional arrangement, which has been good for the public\nand I hope—and I hope and strongly believe that it will continue.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Kyle.\nKYLE CAMPBELL. Kyle Campbell for American Banker. Thanks for taking the\nquestions, Chair Powell. A couple regulatory developments in the past week that I want to ask\nyou about. First, last week Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr outlined his views for the\nchanges to the Basel III endgame. I’m wondering if you are in alignment with him on what\nthose changes should be, if those have support on the Board in the broad way that you’re looking\nPage 23 of 26\nSeptember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nfor, and if you think the other agencies are also fully onboard with that approach. And then\nyesterday, other banking regulators—\nCHAIR POWELL. You know what, hold the second question.\nKYLE CAMPBELL. Okay. Sure.\nCHAIR POWELL. We’ll give you the second question. So the answer to your question\nis that, yes, those, those changes were negotiated between the agencies with my support and with\nmy involvement, with the idea that we were going to re-propose, re-propose the changes that\nVice Chair Barr talked about and then take comment on them. So, yes, that is—that’s happening\nwith my support.\nKYLE CAMPBELL. Is there a date for that—\nCHAIR POWELL. That’s not a final proposal, though, you understand. We’re putting\nthem out for comment. We’re going to take comment and make appropriate changes. We don’t\nhave a—we don’t have a calendar date for that, and, as for the other agencies, you know, the idea\nis that we’re all moving together, we’re not moving separately, so that—I don’t know exactly\nwhere that is. But the idea is that we will move as a group to put this, again, out for comment,\nand then, you know, it’ll—the comments will come back 60 days later, and we’ll dive into them,\nand we’ll try to bring this to a conclusion sometime in the first half of next year.\nKYLE CAMPBELL. Right. And then, yesterday. there were merger reform finalizations\nfrom the other bank regulators. What does the Fed have to do to align itself on a merger?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, I would—I would bounce that question to Vice Chair\nBarr. It’s a good question, but I don’t have that today. Thanks.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jennifer, for the last question.\nPage 24 of 26\nSeptember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. Thank you, Chair Powell. Jennifer Schonberger with\nYahoo Finance. You said earlier that the decision today reflects with appropriate recalibration\nstrength in the labor market that could be maintained in the context of moderate growth, even\nthough the policy statement says you view the risks to inflation and job growth as roughly\nbalanced. Given what you’ve said, though, today, I’m curious, are you more worried about the\njob market and growth than inflation? Are they not roughly balanced?\nCHAIR POWELL. No, I think—I think, and we think, they are now roughly balanced.\nSo if you go back for a long time, the risks were on inflation. We had a historically tight labor\nmarket, historically tight. There was a severe labor shortage, so very hot labor market. And we\nhad inflation way above target. So, you know, that said to us, concentrate on inflation,\nconcentrate on inflation. And we did for a while, and we kept at that, that the stance that we put\nin place 14 months ago was a stance that was focused on bringing down inflation. Part of\nbringing down inflation, though, is cooling off the economy and a little bit cooling off the labor\nmarket. You now have a cooler labor market, in part because of our activity. So what that tells\nyou is, it’s time to change our stance. So we did that. The sense of the change in the stance is\nthat we’re recalibrating our policy over time to a stance that will be more neutral. And today\nwas—I think we made a good strong start on that. I think it was the right decision, and I think it\nshould send a signal that we, you know, that we’re committed to coming up with a good outcome\nhere.\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. Is the economy more vulnerable to a shock now that\ncould tip it into recession?\nCHAIR POWELL. I don’t think so. I don’t—there’s—as I look—well, let me look at it\nthis way: I don’t see anything in the economy right now that suggests that the likelihood of a\nPage 25 of 26\nSeptember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nrecession—sorry, of a downturn is elevated, okay? I don’t see that. You see—you see growth at\na solid rate, you see inflation coming down, and you see a labor market that’s, that’s still at very\nsolid levels. So, so I don’t really see that, no. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you.\nPage 26 of 26"

    "statement": "For release at 2:00 p.m. EST November 7, 2024\nRecent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace.\nSince earlier in the year, labor market conditions have generally eased, and the unemployment\nrate has moved up but remains low. Inflation has made progress toward the Committee’s\n2 percent objective but remains somewhat elevated.\nThe Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of\n2 percent over the longer run. The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment\nand inflation goals are roughly in balance. The economic outlook is uncertain, and the\nCommittee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.\nIn support of its goals, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal\nfunds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent. In considering additional\nadjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess\nincoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.

    "press_conf": "November 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nTranscript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference\nNovember 7, 2024\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on\nachieving our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of\nthe American people. The economy is strong overall and has made significant progress toward\nour goals over the past two years. The labor market has cooled from its formerly overheated\nstate and remains solid. Inflation has eased substantially from a peak of 7 percent to 2.1 percent\nas of September. We are committed to maintaining our economy’s strength by supporting\nmaximum employment and returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.\nToday, the FOMC decided to take another step in reducing the degree of policy restraint\nby lowering our policy interest rate by ¼ percentage point. We continue to be confident that,\nwith an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, strength in the economy and the labor\nmarket can be maintained, with inflation moving sustainably down to 2 percent. We also\ndecided to continue to reduce our securities holdings. I’ll have more to say about monetary\npolicy after briefly reviewing economic developments.\nRecent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace.\nGDP rose at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the third quarter, about the same pace as in the\nsecond quarter. Growth of consumer spending has remained resilient, and investment in\nequipment and intangibles has strengthened. In contrast, activity in the housing sector has been\nweak. Overall, improving supply conditions have supported the strong performance of the U.S.\neconomy over the past year.\nIn the labor market, conditions remain solid. Payroll job gains have slowed from earlier\nin the year, averaging 104,000 per month over the past three months. This figure would have\nbeen somewhat higher were it not for the effects of labor strikes and hurricanes on employment\nPage 1 of 23\nNovember 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nin October. Regarding the hurricanes, let me extend our sympathies to all the families,\nbusinesses, and communities who have been harm—harmed by these devastating storms.\nThe unemployment rate is notably higher than it was a year ago but has edged down over\nthe past three months and remains low at 4.1 percent in October. Nominal wage growth has\neased over the past year, and the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed. Overall, a broad set of\nindicators suggests that conditions in the labor market are now less tight than just before the\npandemic in 2019. The labor market is not a source of significant inflationary pressures.\nInflation has eased significantly over the past two years. Total PCE prices rose\n2.1 percent over the 12 months ending in September; excluding the volatile food and energy\ncategories, core PCE prices rose 2.7 percent. Overall, inflation has moved much closer to our\n2 percent longer-run goal, but core inflation remains somewhat elevated. Longer-term inflation\nexpectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of\nhouseholds, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.\nOur monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people. We see the risks to achieving our\nemployment and inflation goals as being roughly in balance, and we’re attentive to the risks to\nboth sides of our mandate. At today’s meeting, the Committee decided to lower the target range\nfor the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, to 4½ percent to 4¾ percent. This further\nrecalibration of our policy stance will help maintain the strength of the economy and the labor\nmarket and will continue to enable further progress on inflation as we move toward a more\nneutral stance over time.\nWe know that reducing policy strain—restraint too quickly could hinder progress on\ninflation. At the same time, reducing policy restraint too slowly could unduly weaken economic\nPage 2 of 23\nNovember 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nactivity and employment. In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the\nfederal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and\nthe balance of risks. We are not on any preset course. We will continue to make our decisions\nmeeting by meeting.\nAs the economy evolves, monetary policy will adjust in order to best promote our\nmaximum-employment and price-stability goals. If the economy remains strong and inflation is\nnot sustainably moving toward 2 percent, we can dial back policy restraint more slowly. If the\nlabor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than\nanticipated, we can move more quickly. Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and\nuncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.\nThe Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy—maximum employment and\nstable prices. We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation\nsustainably to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.\nOur success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans. We understand that our\naffect—actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we\ndo is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our\nmaximum-employment and price-stability goals. Thank you. I look forward to our discussion.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Colby.\nCOLBY SMITH. Thank you. Given the expectation that the election outcome will\nproduce policies that would meaningfully impact the U.S. economy next year, how is the\nCommittee taking these proposals into account for upcoming decisions, including potentially the\nnext one in December? And, and can you give us any more sense of how proactive or reactive\nthe Fed is prepared to be to changes in economic policies with the next Administration?\nPage 3 of 23\nNovember 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So let me say that in the near term, the election will have no\neffects on our policy decisions. As you know, many, many things affect the economy, and\nanyone who writes down forecasts in their job will tell you that the economy is quite difficult to\nforecast, looking out past the very near term. Here, we don’t know what the timing and\nsubstance of any policy changes will be. We therefore don’t know what the effects on the\neconomy would be—specifically, whether and to what extent those policies would matter for the\nachievement of our goal variables: maximum employment and price stability. We don’t—we\ndon’t guess, we don’t speculate, and we don’t assume. Now, just in principle, it’s possible that\nany Administration’s policies or, or policies put in place by Congress could have economic\neffects over time—over time that would matter for our pursuit of our dual-mandate goals. So,\nwe—along with countless other factors, forecasts of those economic effects would be included in\nour models of the economy and would be taken into account through that channel.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nick.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Chair Powell, Nick Timiraos from the Wall Street Journal. Roughly\none year ago when the 10-year Treasury was flirting with 5 percent and 30-year mortgage rates\nwere near 8 percent, you noted how higher borrowing costs, if they were sustained, could weigh\non economic activity. Given that you’ve said you believe policy is restrictive and the Fed is now\ndialing back that restriction, are the growth risks presented by higher U.S. Treasury yields today\nany different from those you identified one year ago when inflation was still meaningfully above\nyour target?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I would just say this. We’ve watched the, the run-up in bond\nrates, and it’s, it’s nowhere where it was, of course, a year ago. I guess that, you know, the long-\nPage 4 of 23\nNovember 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nrun rates are well below that level. So we’re watching that. Things have been moving around,\nand we’ll see where they settle. I think it’s too early to really say where they settle.\nUltimately, I’m sure we’ve all read these decompositions of what, you know—and I\ncertainly have, but it’s not really our job to provide our specific decomposition. I will say,\nthough, that it appears that the moves are not, not principally about higher inflation expectations.\nThey’re really about a sense of more likely to have stronger growth and perhaps less in the way\nof downside risks. So that’s what they’re about.\nYou know, we do take financial conditions into account. If they—if they’re persistent\nand if they’re material, then we’ll certainly take them into account in our policy. But I would say\nwe’re not at—we’re not at that stage right now. It’s just something that we’re watching. And,\nagain, these things don’t really have mainly to do with, with Fed policy, but to do with other\nfactors in the economy.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. If I could follow up—is the September SEP—are those rate\nprojections still valid? Do they still seem relevant given where we are now?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know what? It’s—you get halfway through the cycle between\nthe last set and the next set. I, I wouldn’t want to comment one way or the other. You know,\npeople are—let’s talk about the data we’ve gotten since the last meeting.\nSo, in the main, the economic activity data have been stronger than expected. The NIPA\nrevision was stronger. Certainly, the September employment report was stronger; the October\nreport, not stronger; retail sales, stronger. So, overall, though, I think you take away a sense of,\nof some of the downside risks to economic activity having, having been diminished, with the\nNIPA revisions in particular, and so, overall, feeling, feeling good about economic activity. So I\nthink we would factor that in.\nPage 5 of 23\nNovember 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nAt the same time, we got one inflation report, which was—it wasn’t terrible, but it was—\nit was a little higher than expected. So I think, really, the question is, is December. And, you\nknow, by December we’ll have—we’ll have more data: I guess one more employment report,\ntwo more inflation reports, and lots of other data, and, you know, we’ll make a decision as we\nget to December.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jeanna.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times. Thanks for taking our\nquestions, Chair Powell. When it comes to December, what will you be looking at specifically\nas you try to make that decision? And then, as of the Fed’s economic projections in September,\nyou, you had written down four quarter-point interest rate cuts in 2025. Do you still think that\nthose are likely? Is that sort of the baseline outlook at this point, or has that shifted? And if it\nshifted at all, can you—can you give a little bit of, of detail as to why?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, I can’t. We don’t fill out a—we don’t fill out an SEP,\nand I can’t characterize one that wasn’t filled out today. So I can’t really speak for kind of\nexactly where the—where the Committee is. I would just say, for December, we’re going to\nbe—again, in every meeting—we’re going to be looking at the incoming data and how that\naffects the outlook.\nAs you know, we’re in the process of recalibrating from a fairly restrictive level at\n5.33 percent. After today’s move, we’re down 75 basis points. And we’re, we’re asking\nourselves, “Is that where we need to be?” You know that we’re, we’re trying to steer between\nthe risk of moving too quickly and perhaps undermining our progress on inflation or moving too\nslowly and allowing the labor market to weaken too much. We’re trying to, to be on a middle\npath where we can maintain the strength in the labor market while also enabling further progress\nPage 6 of 23\nNovember 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\non inflation. We think that’s where we are, but that’s the question we’re going to be asking in\nSeptember and, and in other meetings. And, again, I can’t really update you on the Committee’s\nthinking, because we don’t fill out an SEP at this meeting.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Yes, total—totally appreciate that. I guess when it comes to your\nown thinking, do you think that that—a full percentage point of rate cuts in 2025—is a\nreasonable outlook?\nCHAIR POWELL. Again, I’m going to wait—we’re going to wait and see how things\ncome in in December. I mean, I—it’s just—I would put it this way: We’re on a path to a more\nneutral stance. And, and that’s very much what we’re on. That has not changed at all since\nSeptember. And, you know, we’re just going to have to see where the—where the data lead us.\nWe have, you know, a whole six weeks of data to look at to make that decision in December.\nObviously, I’m not ruling it out or in, but, but, you know, I would say—you know, I would say\nthat, you know, again, we didn’t update the SEP, so I’m not going to characterize, you know,\nwhere the Committee would be.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Howard.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thanks. Howard Schneider with Reuters. I wondered if you\ncould please elaborate and explain a little bit the two changes in the language of the statement\nhere in the first paragraph when you say, “Inflation has made progress,” dropping the word\n“further progress,” and in the second paragraph dropping the sentence that the Committee had\n“gained greater confidence” that inflation was progressing towards its 2 percent goal. Is there\nany policy substance behind either of those changes in language? Is it—is it meant to open the\ndoor to a December pause? Is it meant to communicate anything about the stickiness of core\ninflation in the last three months?\nPage 7 of 23\nNovember 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. Not really, no. So let me tell you what we were thinking. So the test\nof gaining further confidence was a—was our test for the first rate cut, right? And so we, we met\nthat test in September, and therefore we take that test out. If you leave it in, then it’s new\nforward guidance. It’s brand new forward guidance. “What do you mean by it? Are you—are\nyou making—are you requiring yet further guidance?” We have to say “yes” or “no” at every\nmeeting whether we’ve made further progress.\nThe point is we have gained confidence that, that we’re on a sustainable path down to\n2 percent. So that, I would tell you, is, is what that’s really all about. And it’s not meant to send\na signal. Neither of those is meant to send a further signal. And, you know, saying “further\nprogress” it becomes a test where we don’t want to be—we don’t think it’s a good time to be\ndoing a lot of, of forward guidance.\nYou know, we’re—there’s a fair amount of uncertainty in that—in what I’ve said. The\npath that we’re on, we do know what—where the destination is, but we don’t know the right\npace, and we don’t know exactly where the destination is. So the—the—the point is to find that,\nto find the right pace and the right destination as we go. And I think there’s a fair amount of\nuncertainty about that, and, you know, you don’t want to tie yourself up with, with guidance.\nYou want to be able to make sensible decisions as you go.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Mr. Chairman, you talked about higher\nrates, perhaps from an expectation of higher growth. You didn’t talk about it in terms of\nexpectations of higher deficits. Is that something you think might be behind the recent rise in\ninterest rates, and is that—are rising deficits a concern to you?\nPage 8 of 23\nNovember 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. So we don’t comment on fiscal policy, and, again, I don’t have a lot\nmore to say on, on what’s driving bond yields. In terms of, of policy changes, though, let me\ngive you a sense of how this, this works in the ordinary case. Let’s say Congress is considering a\nrewrite of the tax laws; it doesn’t matter what’s in the content. So we would follow that. At a\ncertain point, we’d, we’d think we see the outline, so we’d start to model it. And then we’d wait,\nand we’d wait, and, at a certain point, the staff would brief the FOMC and say, you know, “This\nis—these are the likely effects.” There’s lots and lots of literature on the effects of tax policy\nchanges on various parts of the economy. So we’d, we’d try to get smart on that. And then the\nlaw actually passes, and, you know, you’d start to put it—you’d probably run an alternative\nsimulation before that happens, just to keep people trying to understand it. Then, then when it\nactually passes, it goes into the model, along with a million other things.\nSo, you know, these—we have a very large economy. Many things are affecting it at any\ngiven time. And, you know, a law change of some kind would go in there, but—it would go in,\nbut it would—you know, it’s a process that takes some time. Clearly, the legislative process\ntakes a lot of time. And, of course, the real question is not the effect of that law. It’s all of the\npolicy changes that are happening. What’s the net effect and, you know, the overall effect on the\neconomy at any given time? So I think that’s a—that’s a process that takes a lot of time and that\nwe go through all the time with every Administration, constantly. And I just—this will be no\ndifferent. But, you know, right now, we’re—there’s nothing to—there’s nothing to model right\nnow. It’s such an early stage. We don’t know what the policies are, and once we know what\nthey are, we won’t—we won’t have a sense of, you know, when they’ll be implemented or, or all\nthose sorts of things. So I think I would just say—\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Mm-hmm.\nPage 9 of 23\nNovember 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. —we’re not doing that now, and all that will take time, and it will be\nvery much regular order when we do do that.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. If I could just follow up on Nick’s question—are the current rates\nsomething you feel like you need to lean against, in that they go against the direction of policy\nby being—adding restriction to the economy? Or do you just take them as a given or perhaps a\nsignal that you should do less?\nCHAIR POWELL. I—look, I just think—the first question is, how long will they be\nsustained? If you remember the 5 percent 10-year, people were drawing massively important\nconclusions only to find, you know, three weeks later that the 10-year was 50 basis points lower.\nSo, you know, it’s material changes and financial conditions that last, that are persistent, that\nreally matter. And we don’t know that about these. What we’ve seen so far? You know, we’re\nwatching it. We’re reading. You know, we’re doing the decompositions and reading others, but\nright now it’s not a major factor in, in how we’re thinking about things.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Chris.\nCHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Thank you. Chris Rugaber at Associated Press. You\nmentioned the positive economic data that we’ve seen since the September meeting, including\nthe revisions to things like savings, higher GDP growth. We saw a stock market jump yesterday.\nThat’s renewed some of the questions about why, why do many cuts at all in this—with this\nbackdrop?\nCHAIR POWELL. So you’re right. As I mentioned, and as you mentioned, the latest\neconomic data have been strong, and that’s, of course, a great thing and highly welcome. But, of\ncourse, our mandate is maximum for employment and price stability, and we think that even with\ntoday’s cut, policy is still restrictive. We understand it’s not possible to say precisely how\nPage 10 of 23\nNovember 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nrestrictive, but we feel that it is still restrictive. And if you look at our goal variables, the labor\nmarket has cooled a great deal from its overheated state of two years ago and is now essentially\nin balance. It is continuing to cool, albeit at a—at a modest rate, and we don’t need further\ncooling, we don’t think, to achieve our inflation mandate. So that’s the labor market.\nInflation has moved down a great deal from its higher—its highs of two years ago, and\nwe judged, as I mentioned, that it’s on a sustainable path back to 2 percent. So the job’s not\ndone on inflation. But if you look at those two things, we judged in September that it was\nappropriate to begin to recalibrate our policy stance to reflect this progress, and today’s decision\nis really another step in that process. Overall, as I mentioned, we believe that with an\nappropriate recalibration of our policy stance, we can maintain strength in the labor market even\nas our policy stance enables further progress toward our inflation goal.\nCHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Great. And just to follow up, could you—what might\ncause you to pause rate cuts in December? What kind of economic data would lead you to that\npath? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So we haven’t, you know, made any decision like that at all. But\nwe’re—so we’re in the process, as I mentioned, of moving policy down—our stance down over\ntime to a more neutral level. And, as a general matter, as we move ahead, we are prepared to\nadjust our assessments of the appropriate pace and destination as the outlook evolves. So, for\nexample, if we were to see the labor market deteriorating, we’d be prepared to move more\nquickly. Alternatively, as we approach levels that are plausibly neutral or close to neutral, it may\nturn out to be appropriate to slow the pace at which we’re dialing back restriction.\nAgain, haven’t made any decisions about that, but that’s certainly a possibility. If you—\nyou can think of it as similar to what we do with asset purchase—with asset runoff with QT. So\nPage 11 of 23\nNovember 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nwe reach a point where we slow the pace, much like an airplane reaching the airport slows down.\nAnd so, you know, it—we’re thinking about it that way, but it’s, it’s something that we’re just\nbeginning to think about.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Edward.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thanks, Chair Powell. So with, with this noise in the jobs\nreports that we’ve seen and you look at the Fed’s favorite inflation, PCE inflation, overall it’s\n2.1 percent—very close to the Fed’s target—but core inflation is 2.7 percent, and it’s been that\nway since July. So why doesn’t this data give fuel to a rate pause for this meeting?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, so I think if you look at the 3- and 6-month—you’re quoting\nthe 12-month.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Yes.\nCHAIR POWELL. So we look at all of them, right?\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Yes.\nCHAIR POWELL. But if you look at three- and six-month core PCE, you’ll see they’re\naround 2.3 percent. So we look at all of them. And we look at—we also—we look at 12 as well.\nBut what it’s telling us is that we really have made significant progress. And we expect there to\nbe bumps. For example, you know, the, the last three months of last year, the core PCE readings\nwere very, very low—probably unsustainably low. So that’s why you see—that’s why forecasts\ngenerally see a couple of upticks toward the end of the year. On the other hand, the January\nreading certainly looks like an example of residual seasonality, so that we saw last year. So\nwhen that falls out of the 12-month calculation in February, we should see it staying down. So\nthere will literally be a bump up and then down. We understand that.\nPage 12 of 23\nNovember 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nOverall, you see the progress on inflation, and you also look at the economy, and you say,\n“What’s—what is the inflation story now? Where is it coming from?” So I point to a couple of\nthings. One is the nonhousing services and goods, which together make up 80 percent of that—\nof the core PCE index, are back to the levels they were at the last time we had sustained\n2 percent inflation, which happens to be in the early 2000s for a period of five, six, seven years.\nSo they’re back at that level. What’s not is housing services.\nSo let’s talk about housing services. Housing services is higher. What’s going on there\nis, you know, market rents, newly signed leases, are experiencing very low inflation. And what’s\nhappening is older, you know, leases that are turning over are taking several years to catch up to\nwhere market, market leases are—market rent leases are. So that’s just a catch-up problem. It’s\nnot really reflecting current inflationary pressures; it’s reflecting past inflationary pressures. So\nthat’s, that’s one thing.\nThe other thing is, I’d say look at the labor market—not a source of inflationary\npressures. Where is it coming from? It’s not a very tight economy. What is the story about\ninflation? You see that catch-up inflation also in insurance and in several other areas. So you’re\nseeing—we’re not, not declaring victory, obviously, but we feel like the story is very consistent\nwith inflation continuing to come down on a bumpy path over the next couple of years and\nsettling around 2 percent. That story is intact, and it won’t be one or two really good data\nmonths, or bad data months aren’t going to really change the pattern at this point, now that we’re\nthis far into the process.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. So you’re quickly trying to get to that neutral rate that you\nsee, or do you foresee that you have some time to get there?\nPage 13 of 23\nNovember 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. Nothing in the economic data suggests that the Committee has any\nneed to be in a hurry to get there. We are seeing strong economic activity. We are seeing\nongoing strength in the labor market; we’re watching that carefully, but we do see maintaining\nstrength there. And so we think that the right way—the right way to find neutral, if you will, is\ncarefully, patiently. Again, that’s not meant to have a specific meaning other than we—to the\nextent—to the extent the economy remains strong, we have the ability to, to take advantage of\nthat as we try to navigate that middle path between the two risks.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Craig.\nCRAIG TORRES. Hi, Chair Powell. Craig Torres from Bloomberg. Two questions\ntoday. Did you learn anything about what Americans think about the economy from the election\nresults? First question. Second question—I want to talk about some labor market indicators, and\nI do so with great respect for your attentiveness to the maximum-employment side of the\nmandate, Chair Powell.\nSo the unemployment rate has been at 4 percent or higher for six months. One of the\nbroadest measures of unemployment is up about a half a point from a year ago. Compensation\ngains are sliding back. The quits rate, a signal of labor market dynamism, has been heading\ndown to that bad neighborhood of the 20-teens. So you have put a marker at Jackson Hole\nsaying any “further cooling” is unwelcome. It is cooling, generally, a little bit further. So at\nwhat point do we reach what you would describe as a shortfall from maximum employment?\nThank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So on your first question, I’m not going to talk about anything\nthat relates directly or indirectly to the election. On the second one, you’re—you know, this is\nthe great question, and it’s the one we think about all the time. So I’ll just say a couple things.\nPage 14 of 23\nNovember 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nYou know, there’s nothing really surprising here. What we know is that the\nunemployment rate is low. We also know that it’s come down significantly—sorry, moved up\nsignificantly from a year or so ago. So we’ve seen a big change upward in unemployment.\nSometimes that has meant bad things. So far, it doesn’t appear to be. It appears that the—I\nwouldn’t say that the labor market has fully stabilized, because I do think it’s continuing to very\ngradually cool, but it seems to be in a good place. And our policy, of course, is designed to keep\nit in that good place, to maintain the strength in the labor market, while also enabling further\nprogress on inflation.\nYou know, you mentioned a bunch of, of indicators, and you’re right. You know, the, the\nopenings to unemployment rate is back to a normal level. I would—I would characterize it more\nbroadly as “normalizing.” You mentioned wages. Wages are still running just a bit above where\nthey would need to be to be consistent with 2 percent inflation, unless productivity is going to\nremain at this high level. If we see the—if we see productivity, you know, more sustainably at\nthese high levels, then that would sustain higher wage gains. So I would say—in fact, you can\nsay it the other way, that, that wage increases are now consistent with 2 percent inflation given\ncurrent productivity readings.\nBut, of course, you know, the lore on productivity readings is whenever you see high\nreadings, you should assume they’re going to revert pretty quickly to the longer-term trend. That\nhas always been the case for 50 years. But, you know, it may be that—we’re now five years. If\nyou look at the NIPA revisions that came out a month ago, we’re five years into, into a nice set\nof productivity readings, which are sustained and very healthy. But, overall, it’s a good labor\nmarket. We could talk about 20 different data series. We’ll be looking at all of them, of course.\nPage 15 of 23\nNovember 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nBut, you know, we don’t want the labor market to, to soften much from here. We don’t think we\nneed that to happen to get inflation back to 2 percent.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi. Victoria Guida with Politico. Some of the President-elect’s\nadvisers have suggested that you should resign. If he asked you to leave, would you go?\nCHAIR POWELL. No.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Can you follow up on is—do you think that legally that you’re not\nrequired to leave?\nCHAIR POWELL. No.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Mike.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television. You talk\na lot about what the data are telling you and how you are dependent on the data. But in terms of\nforward-looking assessments of the economy, what are you hearing from CEOs or other officials\naround the country? What did you hear today from the regional Bank presidents about what\ncompanies and consumers think about where the economy is going from here, rather than\nlooking backwards? And does that match up with what your forecasts have been and what you\nthink the appropriate policy path should be?\nCHAIR POWELL. So it’s hard to characterize a, you know, really interesting set of\ndiscussions we had, and, of course, you’ll see them in the minutes in three weeks. But I would\nsay this. I think, you know, the comments from our Reserve Bank colleagues and from the\nCEOs that they talk to are pretty constructive on the economy right now—pretty constructive,\nfeeling that the labor market is, is, you know, back to normal to the point where it’s no longer\nPage 16 of 23\nNovember 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthat much of a discussion topic in their world, whereas two years ago, it was all they were talking\nabout. So they feel like the labor market’s in balance.\nPeople feel good about where the economy is. Demand is obviously pretty strong. And,\nyou know, you’re seeing, what, 2.8 percent growth in the third quarter estimated. Maybe the\nyear is 2½. This is—this is—you know, this is a strong economy. It’s actually remarkable how\nwell the U.S. economy has been performing with, you know, strong growth, a strong labor\nmarket, inflation coming down. We’re, you know, really performing better than any of our\nglobal peers. And I think that is reflected in what you hear from—what I hear people hear from\nCEOs. I don’t get to talk to a lot of CEOs in my job, but I hear what others summarize from\nthose. And, of course, I hear the Reserve Bank presidents do a lot of that, and it’s pretty\nconstructive overall. Now, that’s not to say—there are areas of caution and things like that but,\nultimately, overall pretty positive.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. To follow up on the areas of caution, if there were black clouds on\nthe horizon that you identified as something you’re watching, what would they be?\nCHAIR POWELL. I think it’s—you know, it’s things like—clearly, geopolitical risks\naround the world are elevated, and just as clearly, they’ve had relatively little effect on the U.S.\neconomy. Now, that can change through the price of oil or otherwise, but people talk about\nthose as, you know, something that’s on the horizon all the time. But, you know, ultimately, if\nyou look at the U.S. economy, its, its performance has been very good. And that’s, that’s what\nwe hear from businesspeople, an expectation that that will continue. If anything, people feel next\nyear—I’ve heard this from several people—that next year could even be stronger than this year.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Andrew.\nPage 17 of 23\nNovember 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nANDREW ACKERMAN. Hi. It’s Andrew Ackerman with the Washington Post. I just\nwanted to follow up on the discussion earlier on fiscal policy. Your predecessors Greenspan and\nVolcker spoke up loudly when they thought large budget deficits endangered financial—\neconomic or financial stability. Will you do that, too? And, right now, we’re in a period of full\nemployment. We have large budget deficits and debt at historic, historic highs that are—and\nrising. Is that something you’d speak out against?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, you know, I have said many times no more, no less than what the\npredecessors you mentioned have said. And what that is is that the U.S. fiscal—federal\ngovernment’s fiscal path—fiscal policy is on an unsustainable path. The level of our debt\nrelative to the economy is not unsustainable. The path is unsustainable. And we see that. And,\nyou know, you’ve got a very large deficit at—you’re at full employment, and that’s expected to\ncontinue. So it’s important that we—you know, that that be dealt with. It is ultimately a threat\nto the economy. Now, I can say that. I don’t have oversight. We don’t have oversight over\nfiscal policy. I’ve said it on many occasions—just said it again.\nANDREW ACKERMAN. Okay. Thank you. I guess the only other question is—to\nfollow up on Victoria’s question—do you believe the President has the power to fire or demote\nyou, and has the Fed determined the legality of a President demoting at will any of the other\nGovernors with leadership positions?\nCHAIR POWELL. Not permitted under the law.\nANDREW ACKERMAN. Not what?\nCHAIR POWELL. Not permitted under the law.\nANDREW ACKERMAN. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Courtenay.\nPage 18 of 23\nNovember 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCOURTENAY BROWN. Hi, Chair Powell. Courtenay Brown from Axios. In response\nto Howard’s question, you said it wasn’t an ideal time to give forward guidance because of the\neconomic uncertainties. Can you lay out what some of those uncertainties are and whether or not\nit includes some of the proposals that the President-elect has put out on the campaign trail—\ntariffs, for instance?\nCHAIR POWELL. No. I was not referring to, to the new Administration’s policies at\nall, nor will I today. So I—what I’m just saying is, as we look ahead, we know—and I\nmentioned this in my statement—that the risks are two sided. I guess I should start by saying\nthat we think that the economy and we think our policy are both in a very good place, a very\ngood place. And—but as you look forward, you say, “What are the risks?” And one risk is that\nwe would move too quickly and find ourselves having moved too quickly, and inflation comes\nback, and we—and we lost our chance to get inflation back to 2 percent. So we have to avoid\nthat risk. And that, that—to avoid that risk, that means you want to move carefully. The other\nrisk is that we move too slowly and that we allow the labor market to weaken too much and do\nunnecessary damage to the labor market and to people’s working lives. That, that says, “Don’t\nget behind the curve.”\nSo these are two—these two things are the two risks that we have to manage. And so\nwe’re, we’re in the middle there. We try to be in the middle and deal with both of the—manage\nboth of those. Again, the idea is to maintain support, the strength that we have in the labor\nmarket and in the economy, but also with somewhat less restrictive but still restrictive policy,\nenable further progress toward our 2 percent inflation goal. And so there’s—you know, there—\nthis is the thing: Meeting by meeting, we’re going to be making our assessment of what the right\npath is.\nPage 19 of 23\nNovember 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nYou know, it’s not as important—the precise timing of these things is not as important as\nthe overall arc of them, and the arc of them is to move from where we are now to a sense of\nneutral, a more neutral policy. We don’t know exactly where that is; we only know it by its\nworks. We’re pretty sure it’s below where we are now. But as we move further, there will be\nmore uncertainty about where that is. And we’re going to move carefully as, as this goes on so\nthat, you know, we can increase the chances that we will get it right.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Simon.\nSIMON RABINOVITCH. Thank you, Chair Powell. Simon Rabinovitch with the\nEconomist. I know you don’t want to share your decomposition of bond yields, but if you look\nat the breakevens, it, it is clear that longer-term inflation expectations do seem to have risen up at\nabout 2.5 percent, for example, on the five-year. That’s up half a point from when you cut in\nSeptember. Do you have any concern at all that longer-term inflation expectations are\ndeanchoring or, put another way, are anchoring at a slightly higher level? Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. So we, we would be concerned if we saw—if we thought we saw\nlonger-term inflation expectations anchoring at a higher level. That’s not what we’re seeing.\nWe’re still seeing between surveys and market readings broadly consistent with—you know, I, I\nlooked at the five-year, five-year earlier today, and it’s probably moved, but it’s just not—it’s\njust—it’s kind of right where it’s been, and also it’s pretty close to consistent with 2 percent PCE\ninflation. So that’s one that’s been a traditional one that we look at a lot. But, overall,\nexpectations seem to be—and really have throughout this—in a place that’s consistent with\n2 percent inflation. But you’re right to say we watch that very carefully, and we will not allow\ninflation expectations to drift upward. But that’s, that’s really why we reacted so sharply back in\n2022 was, was to avoid that.\nPage 20 of 23\nNovember 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMICHELLE SMITH. Kelly.\nKELLY O’GRADY. Hi, Chair Powell. Kelly O’Grady, CBS News. We just talked\nabout what you’ve heard from business leaders on the economy, but many average Americans\nare still not feeling the strength of the economy in their wallets. So what’s your message to them\non when they might expect relief?\nCHAIR POWELL. So you’re right that, you know, we say that the economy is\nperforming well, and it is, but we also know that people are still feeling the effects of high prices,\nfor example. And we went through—the world went through a global inflation shock, and\ninflation went up everywhere. And, you know, it, it stays with you because the price level\ndoesn’t come back down. So what that takes is it takes some years of real wage gains for people\nto feel better. And that’s what we’re—that’s what we’re trying to create. And I think we’re well\non the road to creating that.\nInflation has come way down. The economy is still strong here. Wages are moving up\nbut, but at a sustainable level. So it’s just—I think—I think what needs to happen is happening\nand, for the most part, has happened. But it’ll be some time before people, you know, regain\ntheir confidence and feel that. And, you know, we don’t tell people how to—how to feel about\nthe economy. We respect—completely respect—what they’re feeling. Those feelings are true;\nthey’re accurate. We don’t question them. We—you know, we respect them.\nKELLY O’GRADY. And just a quick follow-up—President-elect Trump has been\ncritical of your performance. Any concern about his influence on the Fed’s independence?\nCHAIR POWELL. I’m not going—I’m not going to get into the—any of the political\nthings here today, but thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nancy.\nPage 21 of 23\nNovember 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nNANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Hi, Chair Powell. Nancy Marshall-Genzer with\nMarketplace. What is your plan if we start to see stagflation?\nCHAIR POWELL. So that’s a—you know, the whole plan is not to have stagflation, so\nwe don’t have to deal with it. So that’s our—that is actually our plan. [Laughter] You know,\nit’s, of course, a very difficult thing because you’re—you know, you’re—anything you do with\ninterest rates will, will hurt one side or the other, either the inflation mandate or the—or the\nemployment mandate.\nI would just say that, you know, we’ve, we’ve been able to see inflation come down a\nwhole lot, you know, much closer to our goal without the kind of sharp increase in\nunemployment that has often accompanied programs of disinflation. So knock on wood, we’ve\ngotten this far without seeing a real weakening in, in the labor market. And we believe we can\ncomplete the inflation task while also keeping the labor market strong, and that, of course, is\nexactly what we’re trying to do.\nNANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Can you rule out an interest rate hike next year?\nCHAIR POWELL. I—no. I wouldn’t rule anything out or in that far away. But that’s\ncertainly not, not our plan. I mean, our baseline expectation is that we’ll continue to move\ngradually down towards neutral, that the economy will continue to grow at a healthy clip, and\nthat the labor market will remain strong. If you look at our—look at our—that will not change\nfrom the September SEP. You know, that is our baseline forecast. And, short of some\nexogenous event, it will—that will continue to be our forecast for the foreseeable future. So—\nbut, ultimately, you know, it’s—we’re not in a—we’re not in a world where we can afford to\nrule, rule things out a full year in advance. It’s—there’s just too much uncertainty in what we\ndo.\nPage 22 of 23\nNovember 7, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Jean for the last question.\nJEAN YUNG. Hi, Chair Powell. Jean Yung with MNI Market News. I wanted to go\nback to a comment that you had made about Americans being quite unhappy about the\ncumulative price level rises over the past few years, even though now inflation is back on a path\nto 2 percent. Would it be appropriate for the Fed to undershoot for a while on its inflation goal\nunder the average inflation-targeting regime so people have a chance to catch up?\nCHAIR POWELL. No. That’s, that’s not the way our framework works. We’re aiming\nfor inflation at, at 2 percent. We’re—we do not have—we do not think it would be appropriate\nto deliberately undershoot. And, you know, part of the problem there is that low inflation can be\na problem, too, in a way. But that’s not part of our framework, and it’s not something we’re\ngoing to be—going to be looking at in our framework review.\nThank you very much.\nPage 23 of 23"

    "press_conf": "December 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nTranscript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference\nDecember 18, 2024\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on\nachieving our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of\nthe American people. The economy is strong overall and has made significant progress toward\nour, our goals over the past two years. The labor market has cooled from its formerly overheated\nstate and remains solid. Inflation has moved much closer to our 2 percent longer-run goal.\nWe’re committed to maintaining our economy’s strength by supporting maximum\nemployment and returning inflation to our 2 percent goal. To that end, today, the Federal Open\nMarket Committee decided to take another step in reducing the degree of policy restraint by\nlowering our policy interest rate by ¼ percentage point. We also decided to continue to reduce\nour securities holdings. I’ll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing\neconomic developments.\nRecent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a—at a solid\npace. GDP rose at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the third quarter, about the same pace as in the\nsecond quarter. Growth of consumer spending has remained resilient, and investment in\nequipment and intangibles has strengthened. In contrast, activity in the housing sector has been\nweak. Overall, improving supply conditions have supported the strong performance of the U.S.\neconomy over the past year. In our Summary of Economic Projections, Committee participants\ngenerally expect GDP growth to remain solid, with a median projection of about 2 percent over\nthe next few years.\nIn the labor market, conditions remain solid. Payroll job gains have slowed from earlier\nin the year, averaging 173,000 per month over the past three months. The unemployment rate is\nhigher than it was a year ago, but, at 4.2 percent in November, it has remained low. Nominal\nPage 1 of 28\nDecember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nwage growth has eased over the past year, and the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed. Overall, a\nbroad set of indicators suggests that conditions in the labor market are now less tight than in\n2019. The labor market is not a source of significant inflationary pressures. The median\nprojection for the unemployment rate in the SEP is 4.2 percent at the end of this year and\n4.3 percent over the next few years.\nInflation has eased significantly over the past two years but remains somewhat elevated\nrelative to our 2 percent longer-run goal. Estimates based on the consumer price index and other\ndata indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.5 percent over the 12 months ending in November, and\nthat, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent.\nLonger-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range\nof surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial\nmarkets. The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 2.4 percent this year and\n2.5 percent next year, somewhat higher than projected in September. Thereafter, the median\nprojection falls to our 2 percent objective.\nOur monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people. We see the risks to achieving our\nemployment and inflation goals as being roughly in balance, and we are attentive to the risks on\nboth sides of our mandate.\nAt today’s meeting, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds\nrate by ¼ percentage point, to 4¼-4½ percent. We’ve been moving policy toward a more neutral\nsetting in order to maintain the strength of the economy and the labor market while establishing\nfurther progress in—sorry, enabling further progress on—inflation. With today’s action, we\nhave lowered our policy rate by a full percentage point from its peak, and our policy stance is\nPage 2 of 28\nDecember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nnow significantly less restrictive. We can therefore be more cautious as we consider further\nadjustments to our policy rate.\nWe know that reducing policy restraint too fast or too much could hinder progress on\ninflation. At the same time, reducing policy restraint too slowly or too little could unduly\nweaken economic activity and employment. In considering the extent and timing of additional\nadjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess incoming\ndata, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. We’re not on any preset course.\nIn our Summary of Economic Projections, FOMC participants wrote down their\nindividual assessments of an appropriate path for the federal funds rate, based on what each\nparticipant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward. The median participant projects\nthat the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 3.9 percent at the end of next year and\n3.4 percent at the end of 2026. These median projections are somewhat higher than in\nSeptember, consistent with the firmer inflation projection. These projections, however, are not a\nCommittee plan or decision.\nAs the economy evolves, monetary policy will adjust in order to best promote our\nmaximum-employment and price-stability goals. If the economy remains strong and inflation\ndoes not continue to move sustainably toward 2 percent, we can dial back policy restraint more\nslowly. If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly\nthan anticipated, we can ease policy more quickly. Policy is well positioned to deal with the\nrisks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.\nOn a technical note: We lowered the offering rate on our overnight reverse repo facility\nto align it with the bottom of the target range for the federal funds rate—its typical configuration.\nTechnical adjustments of this kind have no bearing on the stance of monetary policy.\nPage 3 of 28\nDecember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nThe Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy: maximum employment and\nstable prices. We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation\nsustainably to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.\nOur success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans. We understand that our\nactions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in\nservice to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our\nmaximum-employment and price-stability goals. Thank you, and I look forward to your\nquestions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jeanna.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Jeanna Smialek with the New York Times. Thank you for taking\nour questions. I, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about why officials think it’s appropriate\nto cut rates at all in 2025 if inflation is expected to remain firm throughout the year. And what\nwould you expect, at this point, the timing might look like? Would a January cut potentially be\npossible, or does a pause next month seem more likely?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, so let, let me start by saying why we—why we cut today and\nthen—and then move to 2025. So I would say today was a—was a closer call, but we decided it\nwas the right call because we thought it was the best decision to foster achievement of both of\nour goals, maximum employment and price stability. We see the risks as two-sided: moving too\nslowly and needlessly undermine economic activity and the labor market, or move too quickly\nand needlessly undermine our progress on inflation. So we’re trying to steer between those two\nrisks, and, on balance, we decided to go ahead with a further cut. And I, I’ll give you some\ndetails on why.\nPage 4 of 28\nDecember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nDownside risks to the labor market do appear to have diminished, but the labor market is\nnow looser than pre-pandemic, and it’s clearly still cooling further, so far in, in a gradual and\norderly way. We don’t think we need further cooling in the labor market to get inflation down to\n2 percent. Job creation is now well below the level or certainly below the level that would hold\nunemployment constant, the job-finding rate is low and declining, and other measures—such as\nsurveys of workers and businesses, quits, things like that—broadly show a, a much cooler labor\nmarket than there was, than we had in 2019. It’s still quite gradually cooling. So we, we keep an\neye on that.\nInflation, we see that story as still broadly on track, and, and I’ll tell you why. We, we’ve\nmade a great deal of progress. Twelve-month core inflation, as I mentioned, through November\nis estimated at 2.8 percent, down from a high of 5.6 percent. Twelve—but 12-month inflation\nhas actually been moving sideways, as we are “lapping” very low readings of late last year.\nHousing services inflation actually is steadily coming down now, albeit at a slower pace than we\nmight like, but it has now come down substantially and it is making progress, slower than hoped.\nAnd we, we’ve had recent high readings from nonmarket services and some bumpiness for\ngoods. So I’ll just say, we, we—so remember that we couple this decision today with the “extent\nand timing” language in the postmeeting statement that signals that we are at or near a point at\nwhich it will be appropriate to slow the pace of further adjustments.\nYou ask about 2025. I, I think that the lower—the slower pace of cuts for next year\nreally reflects both the higher inflation readings we’ve had this year and the expectation that\ninflation will be higher. You saw in the SEP that risks and, and uncertainty around inflation we\nsee as higher. Nonetheless, we, we see ourselves as, as still on track to continue to cut. I think\nthe actual cuts that we make next year will not be because of anything we wrote down today.\nPage 5 of 28\nDecember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nWe’re, we’re going to react to data. That’s just the general sense of what the Committee thinks\nis likely to be appropriate.\nJEANNA SMIALEK. Sorry, just one, one quick follow-up: Why, I guess, would you\nmake those cuts? Like, what would—what would be the trigger to cut?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we’re—to, to cut further after this point, I, I would say it this\nway: We’ve reduced our policy rate now by 100 basis points. We’re significantly closer to\nneutral. At 4.3 percent and “change,” we believe policy is still meaningfully restrictive. But as\nfor additional cuts, we’re going to be looking for further progress on inflation as well as\ncontinued strength in the labor market. And as long as the economy and the labor market are\nsolid, we can be cautious about—as we consider further cuts. And all of that is reflected—to\nyour question—in the December SEP, which shows a median forecast of down [to] two cuts next\nyear, compared to four in September.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Howard.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Howard Schneider with Reuters, and thanks for the\nopportunity to ask you a question. So this does seem similar to the dynamic in 2016 during the\nlast transition to a Trump Administration, where the Committee saw slightly tighter policy in\npart in expected anticipation of the fiscal policy stance that was seen evolving over the year.\nSome of it was a data mark-to-market exercise, and some of it was anticipation of fiscal. What’s\nthe split on this one? How much of this was accounting for inflation data that was coming in,\nand how much of it is expecting that there will be inflationary fiscal policy next year?\nCHAIR POWELL. I, I’d say—I’d, I’d point to five or six things, and, and I’d start—let\nme start by saying that we think the economy’s in a really good place, and we think policy’s in a\nreally good place. Let’s remember that the economy’s growing 2½ percent this year, that\nPage 6 of 28\nDecember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ninflation has come down by 50 percent to, to—from 5.6 percent to 2.6 percent. Headline\ninflation is 2.5 percent on a 12-month basis. We’re actually in a really good starting place here.\nBut since, you know—so, so what’s really driving the, the slower rate-cut path? First\nthing is growth is stronger, right? We, the economy grew faster in the second half of 2024, so\nfar, than we had expected and is expected to be above what our expectations in September next\nyear as well. Unemployment is lower, and, you know, in the SEP, you’ll see that participants\nthink that the—that the downside risks are less and uncertainty is less. And so that’s, that’s more\nstrength, right?\nInflation is higher, as we talked about. Inflation’s higher this year. It’s also higher in the\nforecast next year. I’d also point out that we’re, we’re closer to the neutral rate, which is another\nreason to be cautious about, about further moves. And—but then getting to your—to your point,\nthere’s also, there’s uncertainty—uncertainty around inflation, I pointed out, is actually higher.\nIt’s also—it’s also, in the case of some people, some people—the way I’d say it is this: Some\npeople did take a very preliminary step and start to incorporate highly conditional estimates of\neconomic effects of policies into their forecast at this meeting and said so in the meeting. Some\npeople said they didn’t do so, and some people didn’t, didn’t say whether they did or not. So we\nhave people making a bunch of different approaches to that. But some did identify policy\nuncertainty as one of the reasons for their, their writing down more uncertainty around inflation.\nAnd, you know, the point of that uncertainty is, it’s kind of commonsense thinking that when the\npath is uncertain you go a little bit slower. It’s not unlike driving on a foggy night or walking\ninto a dark room full of furniture. You just slow down. And so that may have affected some of\nthe people. But as, as I said, there’s a range of—range of approaches on the Committee.\nPage 7 of 28\nDecember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. If I could follow up on that: You mentioned the risk and\nuncertainty indexes toward the back of the document. The upside risk to inflation jumped quite\nsubstantially. The only thing, really, that’s happened—you, you mentioned that the\ndisinflationary story remains intact, yet the risk weighting has jumped to the upside. The only\nreal thing that’s happened is November 5th, in the meantime. Is it fair to say that that’s what’s\ndriving the higher sense of upside risk on inflation?\nCHAIR POWELL. Actually, that’s not the only thing that’s happened. What’s happened\nis that our forecast for inflation for this year, I think, are five-tenths higher than they were in\nSeptember. So, you’ve got—you had two months of higher inflation, September and October.\nAs I mentioned, November is, is back on track. But, you know, once again we’ve, you know,\nwe’ve had a year-end projection for inflation and it’s kind of fallen apart as we’ve approached\nthe end of the year. So that is certainly a large factor in people’s thinking. I can tell you that\nmight be the single biggest factor is inflation has once again underperformed relative to\nexpectations. It’s still, you know, going to be between 2½ and 3 [percent]. It’s way below\nwhere it was. But, you know, we really want to see progress on inflation, to, to, you know, as I\nmentioned, as we think about further cuts, we’re going to be looking for progress on inflation.\nWe have been moving sideways on 12-month inflation as the 12-month window moves. That’s\nin part because inflation was very, very low measured in, in the 4th quarter of 2023.\nNonetheless, as we go forward, we’re going to want to be seeing further progress on bringing\ninflation down and keeping a solid labor market.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Chris.\nCHRIS RUGABER. Thank you. Chris Rugaber at Associated Press. Thanks for taking\nthe question. In September 2018, the Fed staff in the Tealbook discussed a policy of “looking\nPage 8 of 28\nDecember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthrough” any new tariffs as long as they were one-time increases and inflation expectations\nremained anchored. Could you comment on if that analysis remains effective and any other\nthinking on tariffs generally that you can share?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I do think that the 2018, the September 2018 Tealbook alternative\nsimulations are a good place to start. I happened to have brought them here with me today. I’m\nsure you have them too. They’re, they’re a good starting point, and, and I would just say, you\nknow, it’s six-years-old analysis. But nonetheless, this is still, I think, I think the right, the right\nquestions to ask. And, you know, there, there were two simulations: one was—one was “seeing\nthrough,” one was not. And I point you to, you’ll— there’s some language in the—in the “see-\nthrough” paragraph. It says, you know, it considers situations in which it might be appropriate to\n“see through” inflation and then, and then names some conditions that in, in which it might not\nbe.\nIn any case, this is not a question that’s in front of us right now. We, we won’t face that\nquestion—we don’t know when we’ll face that question. What the Committee’s doing now is, is\ndiscussing pathways and understanding, again, the ways in which tariff-driven inflation can\naffect—tariffs can affect inflation and the economy, and, and how to think about that. So, we’re,\nwe’re—we’ve done a bit of, good bit of work, all of us have, each of us has, and, you know, it\nputs us in position, when we finally do see what the, what the actual policies are, to be, to make,\nyou know, a more, more careful, thoughtful assessment of what might be the appropriate policy\nresponse.\nCHRIS RUGABER. Great, and just a quick follow[-up]. Do you, given the recent bout\nof inflation that we’ve been through, with consumers seeing how, you know, prices can rise and\nbusinesses being—seeing that they can raise prices, at least for some time, does that make it a\nPage 9 of 28\nDecember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nlittle bit riskier to look through tariffs? I mean, are—do you feel that you have to respond more\nquickly to inflation threats, given what we’ve seen the past few years?\nCHAIR POWELL. So the, the main thing is—and this is also a point in these alternative\nsimulations—is that there’re just many, many factors that go into what, what—how much tariffs\nwill, will even go into consumer inflation. How persistent will that be? And, you know, so, we\njust—we just don’t know, really, very much at all about the actual policies, so it’s very\npremature to try to make any kind of conclusion. We don’t know what’ll be tariffed, from what\ncountries, for how long, and what size. We don’t know whether there’ll be, you know,\nretaliatory tariffs. We don’t know what the, you know, the transmission of any of that will be\ninto consumer prices.\nTo your—to your point as well, I don’t—I wouldn’t say that we know whether the last\nepisode is or is not a good model for what happened. You pointed out we’ve just been through a\nperiod of high inflation. We’ve just gotten through that period. That’s a difference. It was also\nquite a bit of diversion of trade away from China to other countries, since that, that may—that\nmay have affects. I don’t know. I just think we, we need to take our time, not rush, and make a\nvery careful assessment, but only when we’ve actually seen what the policies are and how\nthey’re implemented. And, you know, we’re just—we’re just not at that stage. We’re at the\nstage of doing what other forecasters are doing—which is kind of thinking about these questions,\nbut not, not trying to get to definitive answers for some time.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nick.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, to make sure\nI understand, participants today revised up their core PCE inflation projection for ’25 so that the\ncentral tendency runs from 2½ to 2.7 percent, and, as Howard noted earlier, most of the\nPage 10 of 28\nDecember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCommittee sees the risks to those projections to the upside. So if inflation only declines next\nyear from 2.8 to 2.5 to 2.7, what would compel the Committee to be cutting in that situation?\nCHAIR POWELL. Let me—let me find these numbers. So we have—we have inflation\ncoming down, core inflation coming down to 2½ [percent] next year. That’s, that’d be—that’d\nbe significant progress. You see a slower path. I think that does take on board that we want to\nsee real progress. But we, we, you know, we’d be seeing meaningful progress to get inflation\ndown to that level. That wouldn’t be all the way to 2 percent, but that would be, it would be, you\nknow, better than this year. This year, [it] will be 2.8 or 2.9. That would be meaningful. We,\nwe also have to think about the, the, you know, the labor market. And while we, we have the\nlabor market forecast as being in good shape, we are also mindful that it is still out there very\ngradually cooling, so far in an orderly, gradual way. But it’s also something we need to keep our\neye on.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. I, I guess, if I could follow up: If somebody looked at these\nprojections and also the insertion of the “extent and timing” language in the statement, which has\nbeen used at times in the past when the Committee thinks maybe it’s going to be on hold for a\nwhile, and they said, “Gee, this looks like it could be the last rate cut for some time,” would they\nbe mistaken to, to infer that?\nCHAIR POWELL. So that’s, that’s not the—that’s not any decision that we’ve made at\nall. Let me explain “extent and timing.” So the, the sense of that wording is to make clear that if\nthe economy does evolve about as anticipated, we’re at a point at which it would be appropriate\nto slow the pace of rate cuts. So “extent,” that just relates to how, how much further we can\nreduce our policy rate consistent with getting to a neutral stance. Clearly, that distance has\nshrunk by 100 basis points. So it’s significantly smaller. So that’s, that’s the “extent” question.\nPage 11 of 28\nDecember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nAnd, again, we’re going to be looking for further progress on inflation, as well as a strong labor\nmarket, to make those cuts.\n“Timing” just suggests, again, that we’re at a place where we, we, assuming the economy\ndevelops as expected, we’re at or near a level that will make it appropriate to slow the pace of\nadjustments. So that, that’s what we mean by that. We’re not trying to make decisions about the\nlonger run. You know, we are, we’re trying to make sensible policy as we go. And, you know, I\njust would emphasize the uncertainty, which is, it’s just—it’s just a function of the fact that, that\nwe expect significant policy changes. There’s nothing really unusual about that. I think we need\nto, we need to see what they are and see what the effects they will have. We’ll, we’ll have a\nmuch clearer picture, I think, you know, when that happens.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Mike.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television. Even\nthough you’ve cut rates by 100 basis points this year, we haven’t seen much change in\nmortgages, auto loan rates, or credit card rates. You say you’re significantly restrictive. Are you\nrunning a risk that the markets are fighting against you and the economy could be more at risk of\na slowdown than you anticipate?\nCHAIR POWELL. So the, the risks that you—sorry, the rates that you talked about are,\nare really longer-run rates, and they’re affected, they are affected to some extent by Fed policy,\nbut they’re also affected by many other things. And longer rates have actually gone up quite a\nbit since September, as, as you well know, and those are the things that drive, for example,\nmortgage rates more than short-term rates do. So we look at that, but we look at all financial\nconditions, and then we look at what’s happening in the economy. So what we see happening in\nthe economy, again, is, you know, most forecasters have been calling for a slowdown in growth\nPage 12 of 28\nDecember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nfor a very long time, and it keeps not happening. So we have—we’re now well into another year\nof growth. It looks like it might be 2½ percent. Third and—second and third quarters were right\nabout at the same level. So the U.S. economy is just performing very, very well. Substantially\nbetter than our global peer group. And I, I—there’s no reason to think a downturn is, is any\nmore likely than it—than it usually is.\nSo, the outlook is pretty bright for our economy. We have to stay on task, though, and\ncontinue to have restrictive policies so that we can get inflation down to 2 percent. We’re also\ngoing to be looking out for the labor market. We want to keep the labor market pretty close to\nwhere it is. We’re pretty close to estimates of the, the natural rate of unemployment. Job\ncreation is, is a little below the, the level that would keep it there but, nonetheless, close. And so\nthat’s what our policy’s trying to achieve.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. If I could follow up by asking about—your formulation for\nbeginning rate cuts included the phrase “we need to have confidence that inflation is moving\ndown towards our target.” Given the fact that you’ve raised your forecast for next year, do you\nhave confidence or are you uncertain about the path of inflation going forward?\nCHAIR POWELL. So confidence was our test for raising rates, and, you know, we’ve\nmade—look, look at the broader suite: We’ve made just a great deal of progress. We’re, you\nknow, we’re well into the 2’s in, in core inflation and around 2½ [percent]—or even lower than\nthat, we have been—for headline inflation. So I, I would say I’m confident that inflation has\ncome down a great deal, and I, I’m confident in the story about why it’s come down and why\nthat portends well. And I’ll—and I’ll tell you why. You, again, you do see with housing\nservices inflation, which is one that we’ve really worried, worried about, it really has come down\nnow quite steadily, at a slower pace than we thought, you know, two years ago, but it’s\nPage 13 of 28\nDecember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nnonetheless steadily coming down as, as market rents, you know, market rents start to equilibrate\nbetter with, you know, new leases that turn over. Not, not new tenants, but new leases. Market\nrents is new leases. So that, that’s happening; that process is ongoing pretty much as we expect.\nGoods inflation, which is another big piece of it, has returned right to the range where it\nwas before the pandemic. Just for some months this year it kind of moved up in a bumpy way\nbecause of used cars and things like that. But we think, overall, that should generally be in the\nrange it was in. Then that leaves nonhousing services, and market-based nonhousing services are\nin, in good shape. It’s nonmarket services, and those are—those are services that are imputed\nrather than measured directly, and they, they don’t, we, we think they don’t really tell us much\nabout the, you know, about tightness in the economy. They don’t really reflect that. I mean, a\ngood example is financial services, which is really done off of asset prices, and that just—so that,\nthat’s how that inflation works.\nSo the overall picture, the story of why inflation should be coming down, is still intact.\nIn particular, the labor market—look at the labor market. It’s, it is cooler by so many measures\nnow—modestly cooler than it was in 2019, a year when inflation was well under 2 percent. So\nit’s not a source of inflationary pressures. Not to say there aren’t regional and, and, you know,\nparticular professions where labor is tight. But, overall, you’re not getting inflationary impulses\nof any significance from the labor market.\nSo what’s the story? The story is still just, we’re unwinding from these large shocks that\nthe economy got in 2021 and ’22 in, for example, housing services, and now also in, in\ninsurance, in particular, where costs went up, and those are now being reflected later in housing\ninsurance. It’s real inflation, but it doesn’t portend persistently high inflation. So we and most\nother forecasters still feel that we’re on track to, you know, to get down to 2 percent. It might\nPage 14 of 28\nDecember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ntake another year or two from here, but I, I’m confident that that’s the path we’re on. And, you\nknow, our policy will do everything it can to assure that that is the case.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Colby.\nCOLBY SMITH. Thank you. Colby Smith with the Financial Times. So the\nunemployment rate as of November, while still very low, is within spitting distance of the level\nthat generated a lot of concern about the labor market over the summer in the lead-up to the\n50 basis point cut in September. Hiring has also narrowed to just a handful of sectors. But now\nthe Committee appears comfortable skipping cuts at upcoming meetings. So what has changed\nabout the Committee’s assessment of the risks confronting the labor market? Is there just less\nconcern now on that front, or is it just about there being more upside risk to inflation that now\nneeds to be accounted for?\nCHAIR POWELL. The, the unemployment rate has now—is now the same as it was in\nJuly: 4.2 percent. It’s moved up and down, but it’s now the same as July. And job creation is, is\nlower than it has been, but it’s been—it’s been steady—it’s not—it’s not declining. It’s been\nsteady at a level which, as I pointed out a couple times, is actually below the level that would\nhold the unemployment rate constant, but it’s not so far below. So, you might—you might—if,\nif we have the, the breakeven level right, and if jobs continue—job creation continues at that\nlevel in the establishment survey, then you would get a tenth maybe every other month kind of\nthing. So gradually declining. But we don’t have that kind of precision in this.\nSo, but you’re right, though, and I, I read out some of the reasons. We, we do think the\nlabor market is still cooling by many measures, and we’re watching that closely. It’s, it’s not\ncooling in a—in a quick or in a way that really raises concerns. I think, you know, you pointed\nout participants in the FOMC really thought that the risks and uncertainty had improved relative\nPage 15 of 28\nDecember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nto the labor market. And it’s because of, because things have just gotten a little bit better, it\ndoesn’t—the unemployment rate flat and things like that. Nonetheless, you know, we’re\nwatching it closely.\nCOLBY SMITH. If, if the idea, though, is that no additional kind of softening in the\nlabor market is welcome here, what’s to prevent that from happening if rates are still restrictive?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I—what I said is, we don’t think we need further softening to get\nto 2 percent inflation. That’s what I’m saying, not that it’s not welcome. We don’t need it, we\ndon’t think. If, if you had a situation where inflation’s moving around by a tenth every few\nmonths, that’s, you know, we’d have to weigh that against the fact that inflation has in recent\nmonths been moving sideways in the 12-month window. And so we’ve got to weigh them both,\nat this point. You know, for a while there we were only really focused mainly, mainly focused\non, on inflation. We’ve now gotten to a place where, where the risks of the two are what we\nthink are broadly, roughly in balance. And so that’s how we think about it.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Mr. Chairman, I, I did not hear you use the word “recalibration”\ntoday. And I’m just wondering if the recalibration phase is over and what you might call this\nnew phase and whether the criteria for changing rates is somehow different and higher than it\nwas before. Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. We’re not—we’re not renaming the phase—yet. But we may get\naround to that. But, no, I, I would say we, we are, though, in, in a new phase in the process, as I\nsaid. So, and that’s just because we’ve reduced—we’ve reduced our policy rate by 100 basis\npoints. We’re significantly closer to neutral. We still think where we are is meaningfully,\nmeaningfully restrictive, and I think from this point forward, you know, it’s appropriate to move\nPage 16 of 28\nDecember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ncautiously and look for progress on inflation. We’ve, you know, we’ve done a lot to support\neconomic activity by cutting 100 basis points, and that’s a good thing. I, I think it would—I\nsupport the decision, and, and I think it was the right decision to make. I think from now we are\nin a place where the risks really are in balance, and we need to see progress on inflation. And\nthat’s, that’s how we’re thinking about it. So it is kind of a new thing. We moved pretty quickly\nto get to here, and I think going forward, obviously, we’re going to be moving slower, which is\nconsistent with, with the SEP.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Wonder if I could follow up and ask you how much you or the\nCommittee are looking through some of the high numbers we’ve had in the recent inflation\nnumbers. For example, cars being up maybe because of the hurricanes, eggs because of the\navian flu, that, that kind of stuff. And, and then looking forward, perhaps, to housing inflation\ncoming down, as it did in the recent report.\nCHAIR POWELL. So we, yeah, we always try to be careful about not throwing out the\nnumbers we don’t like, you know? It’s just a, an occupational hazard is, is to [say], “Look, those\nhigh months are wrong.” What about the low months? You know, we’ve got, we have a very\nlow month, potentially, in November. You know, it’s estimated by many to be in the mid-teens\nfor core PCE. So that could be idiosyncratically low. We try to look—we try to look at not just\na couple or three months. We shouldn’t have—our, our position shouldn’t change based on two\nor three months of good or bad data. We have a long string now of inflation coming down\ngradually over time. As I mentioned, 12-month, I think it’s 12-month headline’s 2½; 12-month\ncore is 2.8. That’s way better than we were. We still have some work to do, though, is how\nwe’re looking at it. And we need policy to remain restrictive to, to get—to get that work done,\nwe think.\nPage 17 of 28\nDecember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMICHELLE SMITH. Neil.\nNEIL IRWIN. Thanks Chair, Chair Powell. Neil Irwin from Axios. Financial markets\nhave been very buoyant, really all year. Is the Committee comfortable with where financial\nconditions are, or do you see a risk that looseness in financial conditions could undermine\nprogress on your inflation target?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we, we do look carefully at financial conditions, of course; that’s\npart of what we do. But, you know, we, we really look carefully at is the performance of our—\nof our goal variables and, and how are we affecting the economy. So what we’ve seen over the\ncourse of—just take the last year. We, we’ve seen inflation—well, over the last couple of\nyears—come down a lot. We’ve seen the labor market cool off quite a bit. That suggests that\nour policy is restrictive.\nWe’ve, we can also look more directly at, at the parts of the economy that are affected\nby—that, that are interest sensitive, like particularly housing. Housing activity is, is very low,\nand that’s partly, significantly because of our policy. So we think our policy is working. It’s\ntransmitting, and it’s having the effects on our goal variables that we would want. You know, a\nlot of things move financial conditions around, as you know, and we don’t really control those.\nBut I’d say we, we see the effects we’re hoping to see on, on the goal variables and, and the\nplaces where we’d expect to see it.\nNEIL IRWIN. So, if I may, speaking of assets that have—that have been buoyant, do\nyou see any value or benefit in the U.S. government building a reserve of Bitcoin?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, you know, we, we’re not allowed to own Bitcoin. The Federal\nReserve Act says what we can own, and we’re, we’re not looking for a, a law change. That’s the\nkind of thing for Congress to consider, but we are not looking for a law change at the Fed.\nPage 18 of 28\nDecember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMICHELLE SMITH. Andrew.\nANDREW ACKERMAN. Hey, happy holidays, Mr. Chairman. Thanks for taking our\nquestions. I was wondering if you are satisfied with the way 2024 is ending, if you’re confident\nthat we’ve avoided the recession that forecasters were predicting as inevitable a couple years\nago.\nCHAIR POWELL. I think it’s pretty clear we’ve avoided a recession. I think growth\nthis year has, has been solid, it really has. PDFP, private domestic final purchases, which, which\nwe think is the best indicator of private demand, is looking to come in around 3 percent [real\ngrowth] this year. This is a really good number. Again, the U.S. economy has just been\nremarkable. And it’s—when we, in these international meetings that I attend, this has been the\nstory, is that how well the U.S. is doing. And if you look around the world, there’s just a lot of\nslow growth and continued struggles with inflation. So I feel—I feel very good about where the\neconomy is and the performance of the economy, and we want to keep that going.\nANDREW ACKERMAN. The other thing I just wanted to ask about was the—you, you\nguys have noted that the unemployment rate is, is still low. However, employment rates have\nfallen rather quickly. The prime-age employment rate has fell by about half a point—half a\npercent, rather—recently. The question, I guess, is, do you think there’s maybe more downside\nmomentum in the labor market than the unemployment rate alone is signaling?\nCHAIR POWELL. I don’t think so, no. I think, overall, if you look at it, prime-age\nparticipation is still very high. What, what’s going on in the labor market is that the hiring rate is\nlow. So if you—if you have a job, you’re doing very well, and layoffs are very low, right? So\npeople are not losing their jobs in large numbers, unusually large numbers. If you are looking\nfor a job, though, the hiring rate is low, and that’s a signal of, of lower demand, and it has come\nPage 19 of 28\nDecember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ndown. So we look for signs like that, and that, that’s clearly a sign of softening, further\nsoftening. I didn’t mention it earlier, but I, I think you can see a, an ongoing gradual softening in\nthe labor market. Again, not something we need to see to get 2 percent inflation. And, you\nknow, that’s part of the reason that explains why we moved ahead today with, with our, with the\naction, with, with an additional cut. So, but you take a step back, the level of unemployment is\nvery low—again, participation is high. Wages are at a healthy and, and ever more sustainable\nlevel—wage growth. And so the labor market—this is a good, a good labor market, and, you\nknow, we want to keep it that way.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Amara.\nAMARA OMEOKWE. Thank you. Amara Omeokwe from Bloomberg News. I just\nwant to put a finer point on the labor market. Can you keep the labor market this way, in the\nstrong position that you have described, without further cuts? In other words, do you still view\nthe labor market as needing support to protect against a further cooling?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, we, we can’t know that with any tremendous certainty. I,\nI will say that we think that, that our policy balances the risks—we think the risks are roughly in\nbalance as between the two mandates, and we think the labor market is, is in solid shape. And\nwhen I say it’s softening or cooling, it’s very gradual process. You know, job creations are, are\nmeaningfully positive; wages are, you know, if anything, a little, still a bit above what would be\nsustainable if productivity were to revert to its longer-run trend. If you, if you take into account\nthe high productivity readings we’ve had, then wages are already at a sustainable level relative to\n2 percent inflation.\nSo, again, I, I don’t want to overstate the downside in the labor market, because the\ndownsides clearly appear to have diminished. Nonetheless, it’s, it’s one of our mandate goals,\nPage 20 of 28\nDecember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nand, you know, we pay close attention to it, and it’s, it’s worth noting that it is still gradually\ncooling—gradually and in an orderly way. And, and, you know, that’s, that’s how I would\ncharacterize it, and that’s why we’re paying careful attention.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Elizabeth.\nELIZABETH SCHULZE. Thanks so much, Chair Powell. Elizabeth Schulze from ABC\nNews. As you’ve noted, the Fed is now forecasting higher inflation next year. High prices are\nstill a burden for so many households right now. Why do you think it is that inflation is proving\nto be more stubborn than you’d expected?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, it, it breaks down into a long answer, if you want, but it\njust has been a little bit more stubborn. I think if you go back two or three years, many people\nwere saying that to get this far down we would’ve had to have a, had a deep recession and, you\nknow, high unemployment by now. Well, that has not been the case, so, you know, the, the path\ndown has actually been much better than many predicted. We, we’ve managed to, to have the\nunemployment rate remain essentially at its longer-run natural rate, while inflation has come\ndown from—you know, core PCE inflation has come down from 5.6 percent to 2.8 percent on a\n12-month basis. So that’s, that’s a pretty good outcome.\nWhy hasn’t it come down [more]? One reason is that, that—just a technical issue around\nthe way we calculate housing services, and that, that process has been slower than—market rents\nhave, are showing up more slowly in that measure than we might have thought three, two, two\nyears ago. So that’s part of it.\nI think there are other, other parts of the story, but, you know, the, the—what, what I\nthink people are feeling right now is the effect of high prices, not high inflation. So we, we\nunderstand very well that prices went up by a great deal, and people really feel that. And it’s\nPage 21 of 28\nDecember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nprices of food and transportation and heating your home and things like that. So there’s\ntremendous pain in, in that burst of inflation that was very global. This was everywhere in all the\nadvanced economies at the same time. So now we have—inflation itself is way down, but\npeople are still feeling high prices, and that is—that is really what people are feeling. The best\nwe can do for them—and that’s who we work for—is to get inflation back down to its target and\nkeep it there so that people are earning, you know, big, real wage increases so that their, their\nwages are going up, their, their compensation is going up faster than inflation year upon year\nupon year. And that’s what will restore people’s good feeling about the economy. That’s what it\nwill take, and that’s what we’re aiming for.\nELIZABETH SCHULZE. And as we look ahead to next year, what do you see as the\nbiggest challenge to the economy under the next Administration?\nCHAIR POWELL. I feel—I feel very good about where the economy is, and, honestly,\nI’m very optimistic about, about the economy, and it’s—we’re, we’re in a really good place; our\npolicy’s in a really good place. I, I expect another good year next year.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Edward.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thanks, Chair Powell, for doing the questions. Edward\nLawrence from Fox Business. So you say that we’re closer to the neutral rate. What percent do\nyou see, and the Committee believes—where is that neutral rate?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I’ll say a couple things. First of all, when we, when we write—\nthe thing we write down in the Summary of Economic Projections is the longer-run neutral rate,\nwhich is the neutral rate at a time when supply and demand are in balance, the full economy’s in\nbalance, and no shocks are hitting the economy. That is not where we are right now. So when\nwe’re making monetary policy at the Fed, that’s not the question we’re asking. So you can’t do a\nPage 22 of 28\nDecember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nstraight read between those longer-run numbers that we write down and what we think the\nappropriate policy should be. So, basically, at any given time, various shocks are hitting the\neconomy. And so what we’re doing in, in real time is we’re looking at our policy stance, and\nwe’re looking at the way it’s hitting the economy, and, particularly, we look at the effects it’s\nhaving as we try to move the economy toward maximum employment and price stability.\nAnd the answer can be that there are things that affect the economy that are—that are\nlasting but not permanent. And the, the ones that are permanent are the ones that would be in r*.\nThe ones that are, could be lasting, but, but nonetheless go away over time, they could actually\naffect what, what’s sort of technically the appropriate neutral stance in near term. So we’re\nlooking at that, and, you know, we don’t—we don’t know exactly where it is, but as I like to say,\nwe know it by its works, and I think what, what we know for sure is that we’re 100 basis points\ncloser to it right now. There are many estimates of where that might be, and we know we’re a lot\ncloser to it, and I think we’re in a good place. But I think from here it’s a new phase, and we’re\ngoing to be, you know, cautious about, about further cuts.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. But, but I think that the markets are looking for, for a little\nmore clarity. I mean, I’ve heard estimates from 2.9 percent to 4 percent. You know, I, I think\nthe markets would like to see a little more clarity about a year out, 18 months out, as to where\nthat, that goalpost, for lack of a better term, is, because at the moment, it looks big.\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah, I mean, honestly, we—you know, there are countless models\nof what—of what a neutral rate might be at any given time. There, there are empirical models,\nthere are theoretical models, there are things that combine them, and they have as many different\nanswers as you’d like. So there is no real certainty. And, I mean, it’s, it’s actually a good thing\nto know that we don’t know exactly where it is, so you’re not—you’re not tempted to think, “Oh,\nPage 23 of 28\nDecember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nI think this model or this estimate is right.” You, you just have to be open to, you know, the\nempirical data that are coming in and also how it’s affecting the outlook. And it’s not made any\neasier by the fact that, you know, that our policy works with long and variable lags.\nNonetheless, that is the job we have, and so we’re, we’re— I think we need— it’s\nappropriate for us—for us now to proceed cautiously, now that we’re 100 basis points closer to,\nto neutral, and we’ll do so. Meanwhile, the economy seems to be in, in good shape, and these\ncuts will certainly help to support economic activity and the labor market while we can still make\nprogress on inflation, because policy is still meaningfully restrictive.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico. I just wanted to make sure I\nunderstood what you were saying at the beginning about inflation. Are you saying that progress\non core PCE counts as progress on inflation even if headline inflation ticks up? And then also,\nsince that’s what’s projected in the SEP, I was wondering, what accounts for that? Why, why do\nyou all see core PCE going down and, potentially, headline inflation ticking up?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, and as, as I imagine you know, the, you know, the goal overall is\nheadline inflation, because that’s what people experience. People don’t experience core\ninflation; they experience inflation, and that includes food and energy costs. So that’s the overall\ngoal. But, as we know, headline inflation contains energy and food, and those prices can\nfluctuate for reasons that are not related to tightness in the economy and therefore are not really\ngood predictors of future inflation. So it turns out that core inflation is, is a better predictor of\noverall inflation than overall inflation is. So we look at core inflation because it’s a better\nmeasure of what future inflation is like to be, likely to be, because it’s a better measure of, of\nPage 24 of 28\nDecember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nwhat inflation pressures exist. So that’s, that’s—it’s complicated, but ultimately, we, you know,\nour goal is headline, not core. So your question was, your second question was what?\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Why do you all see core going down but headline potentially\nticking up?\nCHAIR POWELL. So headline can be affected—you’re talking about next year.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Mm-hmm.\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah, so headline can, again, it can be affected by energy prices and\nfood prices. So that, there, there will be things in, in the headline forecasts that are to do with\nforecasts of energy prices, whereas core will be—if, if you look at core going out a full year,\nthen it’ll be much more driven by things like tightness in the economy. So it—that, that’s why\nthe two can go in different directions. Headline has been lower, as you know, most of this year,\nbut that’s because energy prices have been coming down, which is a great thing for people. But\nenergy prices will come down, and then they will go up, and it won’t really be telling us anything\nabout how tight the economy is and how, how future inflation will perform.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Do geopolitical risks factor in at all to how you’re thinking about\nenergy prices?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we, we monitor geopolitical risks really quickly, but, you know,\nbut—really carefully, rather. But, you know, I would say so far those risks haven’t really—\nnothing has come out of those risks that really, has really been important for the United States\neconomy. The single thing that you would look to is the price of oil, given that we’re talking\nabout the Middle East and Ukraine, and, you know, and—but that, that is a good summary\nstatistic for the kind of thing that could go wrong in, in, with global turmoil. But the price of\noil’s been coming down, and, for, because of supply conditions, global supply conditions. So we\nPage 25 of 28\nDecember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ndon’t—the U.S. is not feeling, really, the effects of geopolitical turmoil, but we are at, certainly,\nat a time of elevated geopolitical turmoil. And it remains, you know, a risk.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Kelly.\nKELLY O’GRADY. Thanks, Chair Powell. Kelly O’Grady from CBS News. I want to\ngo back to something that you said a minute ago, that wage growth is outpacing inflation now. It\nwasn’t the case for some time, of course. It’s partly why Americans haven’t felt much relief in\ntheir wallets from prices yet. But with inflation ticking up, how worried are you the progress in\nclosing that gap could go away?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah, so inflation—again, we don’t overreact to a couple of months\nof higher readings or a couple months of lower readings. And we, what we had was—we had\nfour months of really nice readings, and then September and October were higher, but then\nNovember is much lower. So I don’t really think the public is experiencing that as a surprising\nupside risk to inflation. I, I think inflation is much lower. What the public is feeling, and they’re\nright about it, is that prices are, are just—the price level went up, because of the past inflation. It\nis going to take some time to, for real wages to recover, over a period of years in which your,\nyour real compensation is growing. And, in other words, your compensation’s growing\nmeaningfully faster than inflation. That’s exactly the kind of economy we have now, and we just\nwant to hold onto it. That, that process will probably take some years, but that’s, that’s what’s\ngoing on right now. And I don’t think that, you know, a, a couple of months of higher inflation\nreally signal that, anything of the nature you’re suggesting.\nKELLY O’GRADY. And just one follow-up: Let’s look more long-term. You\npreviously predicted hitting the 2 percent inflation target in 2026. It’s now been pushed out to\nPage 26 of 28\nDecember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\n2027. You said you’re focused on enabling further progress on inflation. That’s not necessarily\nprogress in the right direction. Are you confident that target isn’t going to move further out?\nCHAIR POWELL. We’re talking about—when you’re projecting the economy, you\nknow, three years out, two years out, you’re talking about high uncertainty. Very high\nuncertainty. You know, we, we really—at that point it, it’s not, it’s not possible to confidently\npredict where the economy is going to be in three years. So what we’re doing is we’re looking at\nwhat’s happening now. And we’re kind of projecting that the same kinds of things are\nhappening—so we, we keep a strong labor market, housing services inflation comes down, goods\nand services—goods inflation settles down, and, you know, nonmarket services return to their,\ntheir prior level. All of those things should happen over time, and, and, you know, those pieces\ncome together. There’s every reason to think that they will. The timing of it is highly uncertain.\nYou know, but you’re not wrong, though, that, you know, we’ve, the— it’s been a bit\nfrustrating because the—while we’ve made progress, it has been slower than we had hoped.\nNonetheless, we’re still on track. And, you know, I think if you’d—if two, two years ago, you’d\nsaid, “we were [going to be] at 4.2 percent unemployment and 2.8 percent inflation,” people\nwould be, would say, “I’ll take that.” I mean, that, that’s a pretty good interim place to be. Job’s\nnot done, but, but I think we’re, we’re feeling good about where we are and where we’re headed.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Go to Nancy for the last question.\nNANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Hi, Chair Powell. Nancy Marshall-Genzer from\nMarketplace. You said a couple times, inflation has been moving sideways. You know, it\nappears to be settling in around, excuse me, 2½ percent. Do you think the Fed is just going to\nhave to settle for that and accept that you’re not going to get to your 2 percent target?\nPage 27 of 28\nDecember 18, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. No, we’re not going to settle for that. I think we’re, we’re, you\nknow, we certainly have every intention and expectations that we’ll get inflation back\nsustainably to 2 percent. That is—and I am confident we will achieve that. It has taken longer,\nbut it’s, you have to be—you know, we are making progress. We have made a great deal of\nprogress. And we’ll continue to do so and get back to 2 percent inflation. That’s what we owe\nthe public. And, and, you know, we’re committed to achieving it.\nNANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. In that case, can you rule out a rate hike next year?\nCHAIR POWELL. You don’t rule things completely in or out in this—in this world.\nThat doesn’t appear to be a likely outcome. I think we’re at 4.3 percent. That’s, that’s\nmeaningfully restrictive, and I, I think it’s a well-calibrated rate for us to continue to make\nprogress on inflation while, while keeping a, a strong labor market.\nSo—Thank you very much.\nPage 28 of 28"

    "press_conf": "January 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nTranscript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference\nJanuary 29, 2025\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on\nachieving our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of\nthe American people. The economy is strong—is strong overall and has made significant\nprogress toward our goals over the past two years. Labor market conditions have cooled from\ntheir formerly overheated state and remain solid. Inflation has moved much closer to our\n2 percent longer-run goal, though it remains somewhat elevated.\nIn support of our goals, today the Federal Open Market Committee decided to leave our\npolicy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings. I’ll have more\nto say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.\nRecent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace.\nFor 2024 as a whole, GDP looks to have risen above 2 percent, bolstered by resilient consumer\nspending. Investment in equipment and intangibles appears to have slowed in the fourth quarter\nbut was strong for the year overall. Following weakness in the middle of last year, activity in the\nhousing sector seems to have stabilized.\nIn the labor market, conditions remain solid. Payroll job gains averaged 170,000 per\nmonth over the past three months. Following earlier increases, the unemployment rate has\nstabilized since the middle of last year and, at 4.1 percent in December, remains low. Nominal\nwage growth has eased over the past year, and the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed. Overall, a\nwide set of indicators suggests that conditions in the labor market are broadly in balance. The\nlabor market is not a source of significant inflationary pressures.\nInflation has eased significantly over the past two years but remains somewhat elevated\nrelative to our 2 percent longer-run goal. Estimates based on the consumer price index and other\nPage 1 of 27\nJanuary 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ndata indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.6 percent over the 12 months ending in December and\nthat, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent.\nLonger-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range\nof surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial\nmarkets.\nOur monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people. We see the risks to achieving our\nemployment and inflation goals as being roughly in balance, and we are attentive to the risks on\nboth sides of our mandate.\nOver the course of our three previous meetings, we lowered our policy rate by a full\npercentage point from its peak. That recalibration of our policy stance was appropriate in light\nof the progress on inflation and the rebalancing in the labor market. With our policy stance\nsignificantly less restrictive than it had been and the economy remaining strong, we do not need\nto be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance. At today’s meeting, the Committee decided to\nmaintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4¼ to 4½ percent.\nWe know that reducing policy restraint too fast or too much could hinder progress on\ninflation. At the same time, reducing policy restraint too slowly or too little could unduly\nweaken economic activity and employment. In considering the extent and timing of additional\nadjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess incoming\ndata, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. We’re not on any preset course.\nAs the economy evolves, we will adjust our policy stance in a manner that best promotes\nour maximum-employment and price-stability goals. If the economy remains—economy\nremains strong and inflation does not continue to move sustainably toward 2 percent, we can\nPage 2 of 27\nJanuary 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nmaintain policy restraint for longer. If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or\ninflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we can ease policy accordingly. Policy is\nwell positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our\ndual mandate.\nAs we previously announced, our five-year review, review of our monetary policy\nframework is taking place this year. At this meeting, the Committee began its discussions by\nreviewing the context and outcomes of our previous review that concluded in 2020 as well as the\nexperiences of other central banks in conducting reviews. Our review will again include\noutreach and public events involving a wide range of parties, including Fed Listens events\naround the country and a research conference in May. Throughout this process, we will be open\nto new ideas and critical feedback, and we will take on board lessons of the last five years in\ndetermining our findings. We intend to wrap up the review by late summer. I would note that\nthe Committee’s 2 percent longer-run inflation goal will, will be retained and will not be a focus\nof the review.\nThe Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy: maximum employment and\nstable prices. We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation\nsustainably to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer-run inflation expectations well anchored.\nOur success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans. We understand that our\nactions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in\nservice to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our\nmaximum-employment and price-stability goals. Thank you. I look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve.\nPage 3 of 27\nJanuary 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Mr. Chairman, Steve Liesman from CNBC. Mr. Chairman, all\nright, at an event in Davos—or from, to Davos, anyway—the President said he’ll demand that\ninterest rates drop immediately. So I guess I have a three-part question. Has the President done\nthis to you? Has he made that demand? Secondly, what is your response to that? And, third,\nwhat effect, if anything—if any, does a President making these kind of remarks have on policy?\nThank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Three questions. I’m seeing, seeing it really as one question, though.\nSo, I, I’m not going to have—I’m not going to have any, any response or comment whatsoever\non, on what the President’s said. It’s not appropriate for me to do so. The public should be\nconfident that we will continue to do our work as we always have—focusing on using our tools\nto achieve our goals, and really keeping our heads down and doing our work. And that’s how we\nbest serve the public.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Could you just comment on whether he’s physically communicated\nhis demand to you?\nCHAIR POWELL. I’ve had no contact.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Thanks.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nick.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, you and\nseveral of your colleagues said around the time of the last meeting that your policy stance was\n“meaningfully restrictive.” Given economic and financial market developments since then, how\nhas your confidence changed in an assessment that says interest rates are meaningfully\nrestrictive?\nPage 4 of 27\nJanuary 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. I don’t think that my assessment really has changed. I mean, a\ncouple of things have happened. We’ve gotten more strong data, but we’ve also seen rates move\nup at the long end, which could represent a tightening in financial conditions. I think if we look\nback over the past year or so, we can see that policy is restrictive. If you look at the effect of\nhigh rates on interest-sensitive spending—for example, in housing—and if you look at the\nachievement of our goal variables, we’re seeing the economy move toward 2 percent inflation\nand, and has moved largely to maximum employment, so. Though we literally look at the—at\nthe—at movement toward the goal variables to make that assessment. Now, policy is\nmeaningfully less restrictive than it was before we began to cut. It’s 100 basis points less\nrestrictive. And for that reason, you know, we’re going to be focusing on seeing real progress on\ninflation or, alternatively, some weakness in the labor market before we—before we consider\nmaking adjustments.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. If I could follow up. Does the economy here warrant meaningfully\nrestrictive interest rates, and would you judge interest rates to still be meaningfully restrictive if\nyou were to lower them by another ¼ point?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, I, I think our policy stance is very well calibrated, as I\nmentioned, to balance the achievement of our two—of our two goals. We, we want to—policy\nto be restrictive enough to continue to foster further, further progress for our 2 percent inflation\ngoal. At the same time, we don’t need to see further weakening in the labor market to achieve\nthat goal, and that’s kind of what we’ve been getting. The labor market has really been broadly\nstable; the unemployment rate has been broadly stable now for six months. Conditions seem to\nbe broadly in balance. And I would say, look at the last couple of inflation readings and you see\nwe don’t—we don’t overreact to two good readings or two bad readings. But, nonetheless, the\nPage 5 of 27\nJanuary 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nlast couple of readings have suggested, you know, more positive readings. So I, I think we’re—I\nthink policy’s well, well positioned.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Colby, from the New York Times.\nCOLBY SMITH. Colby Smith, with the New York Times. Chair Powell, how should we\ninterpret the removal of the line from the statement that inflation has made progress towards the\n2 percent goal? Is that no longer the case?\nCHAIR POWELL. No, so let me look—if you just look at the first paragraph, we did a\nlittle bit of language cleanup there. We took out a reference to “since earlier in the year” as it\nrelated to the labor market, and we just chose to, to shorten that sentence. Again, I, I mean, if\nyou look at the sort of intermeeting data was good, and, and there was—there was another\ninflation reading, I guess, just before the December meeting. So, we’ve got two, two good\nreadings in a row that are consistent with 2 percent inflation. Again, we’re not going to\noverinterpret two good or two bad readings, but this was not meant to send a signal other than\nthis: You know, you, you can take away from all of this that we remain committed to achieving\nour 2 percent inflation goal sustainably.\nCOLBY SMITH. And just to follow up: We’ve seen inflation expectations across a\nnumber of measures rise sharply—which has, in part, been linked to tariff concerns. But there’s\nalso been this encouraging data that you mentioned in terms of CPI and rent indices. So how\nwould you characterize concerns about upside risks to inflation across the Committee, especially\nthose tied to policies related to the Trump Administration?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well I, I’d say you, you see expectations moving up a little bit, at the\nshort end—but not at the longer run, which [is] where it really matters. And those could be\nrelated to—could be related to what you mentioned, some of the new policies. I think where the\nPage 6 of 27\nJanuary 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCommittee is very much in the mode of waiting to see what policies are enacted. We, and we,\nwe don’t know what will happen with, with tariffs, with immigration, with fiscal policy, and with\nregulatory policy. We’re only just beginning to see—actually, are not really beginning to see\nmuch, and I think we need to—we need to let those policies be articulated before we can even\nbegin to make a, a plausible assessment of what their implications for the economy will be. So\nwe’re going to be watching carefully and, and, as we always do. This is no different than any\nother set of policy changes at the beginning of a—of an Administration. We’ll patiently watch\nand understand and, and, you know, kind of not be in a hurry to, to get to a place of\nunderstanding what our policy response should be until we see how it plays out.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Michael McKee.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio. You and\nyour colleagues normally condition future policy moves with the phrase, “if the economy\ndevelops as we anticipate.” Is it fair to say that since there’s a lot unknown about what this\nAdministration’s fiscal policies are actually going to be that you don’t have a medium- to long-\nterm economic forecast that you can have confidence in? Or, if that’s not true, can you lay out\nwhat you think is going to happen in the economy, how you see it developing?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, at all times—at all times, forecasts are conditional, at a\nminimum, on just a set of expectations, and, and they’re highly uncertain in both directions. We,\nwe know that economic forecasting is, is really difficult, beyond just a month or two out. So in\nthe current situation, there’s probably some elevated uncertainty because of, of, you know,\nsignificant policy shifts in those four areas that I mentioned: tariffs, tariffs, immigration, fiscal\npolicy, and, and regulatory policy. So there’s probably some additional uncertainty, but that\nshould be passing; we should go through that. And then we’ll be back to the regular amount of\nPage 7 of 27\nJanuary 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nuncertain. You know, what, what forecasters are doing—not just us, but everybody’s doing—is\nthey’ve got sort of just a set of assumptions about what might happen, but they’re really kind of\nin the nature of a placeholder, and—meaning, you know, plausible, could be, but honestly you\nwouldn’t stand behind it because you just don’t know, and so you’re just—you’re just on hold,\nwaiting to see what comes down. You know, it’s, it’s a very large economy, and policies affect\nit at the margin, but we’ll, you know, we’re going to wait and see.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. If I could follow up. The idea that you feel the—that policy is\nrestrictive suggests that the Fed, in general, wants to continue to lower interest rates. So when\nyou look at the data that you are dependent on, are you looking for data that tell you that you can\ncut or data that will tell you [that] you should hold?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, we’re—we’re looking—it’s more the other—the way—\nthe way it works is, we are looking at the data to guide us in what we should do. And, you know,\nthat, that’s what we do. And right now, we feel like we’re in a very good place. Policy’s well\npositioned. The economy’s in, in quite a good place, actually, as well. And what, what we do\nexpect is to see further progress on inflation, and, you know, as I mentioned, as we see that—or\nif we were to see weakening in the labor market that could foster—we could then be in a position\nof, of making further adjustments. But, right now, we, we don’t see that, and we see things as in\na really good place for policy and for the economy, and so we feel like we don’t need to be in a\nhurry to, to make any adjustments.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Howard.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Howard Schneider with Reuters. Thank you very much. In\n2021, at a central bank conference, you said, quote, “Throughout my career in both public and\nprivate sectors, I’ve seen that the best and most successful organizations are often the ones that\nPage 8 of 27\nJanuary 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nhave a strong and persistent commitment to diversity and inclusion. These organizations\nconsistently attract the best talent by investing in and retaining a world-class workforce.”\nQuestion, first question is, do you still believe that? And if so, how do you intend to put that\nbelief into practice while remaining consistent with the recent executive order prohibiting\ndiversity and inclusion efforts?\nCHAIR POWELL. So let me say, “yes,” in answer to your first question. But, to the\nsecond question, I want to say this: We are, like others, we’re reviewing the orders and the\nassociated details as they are made available. And as has been our practice over many\nAdministrations, we are working to align our policies with the executive orders as appropriate\nand consistent with applicable law. And I want to add that I’m not going to have anything more\nspecific for you today on this whole set of issues.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Well, if I could just follow up quickly on that. I’m wondering\nhow you’re getting that to be consistent with the Dodd-Frank law’s stipulations about\nmaintaining an Office of Minority and Women Inclusion.\nCHAIR POWELL. So I did—I did mention “consistent with applicable law,” right?\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Which is governing.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Elizabeth.\nELIZABETH SCHULZE. Thanks so much. Elizabeth Schulze with ABC News. Just to\nfollow up on Steve’s question, what reassurance can you give the American public that the Fed\nwill continue to operate independent of politics under this Administration?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, I’ve—as I’ve said countless times over the years, this\nis—this is who we are; this is what we do. We study the data, we, we analyze how it will affect\nthe outlook and the balance of risks, and we use our tools to try to give it our best understanding,\nPage 9 of 27\nJanuary 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nour best thinking, try to achieve our goals. That’s what we do; that’s always what we do. Don’t\nlook for us to do anything else. And that’s—you know, lots of research shows that’s the—that’s\nthe best way for a central bank to operate. That’ll give us the best possible chance to achieve\nthese goals for the benefit of the American people. That’s always what we’re going to do. And\npeople should have confidence in that, as I—as I said a few minutes ago.\nELIZABETH SCHULZE. You’ve said that the Fed is in wait-and-see mode, based on\nthe policies that come out of this Administration. Has the Fed started to model what policies like\nmass deportations, changes in immigration policy, specifically, would look like for the\nworkforce and for inflation?\nCHAIR POWELL. So one of the things our, our staff does is they, they look at a range\nof possible outcomes, and, and they, they tend to go from really good to really bad, and, you\nknow, it’s, it’s one of the best things that they do. And in each Tealbook—you can look at the\nfive-year-old Tealbooks and see their alternative simulations. So that’s what they do. They, it’ll\nbe a baseline, and then they’ll show six or seven alternative scenarios, including really good ones\nand, and not-so-good ones. And what those do is they spark, you know, the, the policymakers to\nsort of think and understand about the, you know, the, the uncertainties that surround this. So,\nyes, we, we—staff does that, and we, we’re all well aware that there are—that the range of\npossibilities is always broad, and—not just now, but always. And you have to—it’s hard to be\nopen to just how, how broad the possibilities are for an economy. You know, no one saw the\npandemic coming, and it was—you know, it changed everything. So things happen, and—but\nyes, we do—we do do that. But it’s, it’s one thing to do that to make assessments about what\nmight happen and begin to think about what you might do in that case, but you don’t act until\nyou—until you see much more than we see now.\nPage 10 of 27\nJanuary 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMICHELLE SMITH. Catarina.\nCATARINA SARAIVA. Catarina Saraiva, Bloomberg News. You know, last month\nyou talked about a future rate cut as being pretty, you know, significantly predicated on more\nprogress in inflation. With the characterization of the labor market in the statement today, would\nyou say that that’s even more so the case now?\nCHAIR POWELL. I’d say it’s the same. You know, we, we want to see, you know,\nfurther progress on inflation. And, you know, the story’s there. It’s, it’s—we’re just going to\nhave to see the data. At the end of the day, it, it comes down to 12-month inflation, because that\ntakes out the seasonality issues that may exist. And, you know, we’re, we’re just going to need\nto see that. We think that—we think we see the pathway for that to happen. One, one\nexample—a key example—is that you now do see owner’s equivalent rent and, you know,\nhousing services—the way it’s calculated for PCE [prices], you see that coming down pretty\nsteadily now, and that’s the—that’s the place where the, most of the remaining gap is. In\naddition, a big part of the overrun, as you will know, was [coming] from nonmarket services\n[prices], which don’t tend to send much signal [about future inflation]. So you can look through\nall that and, and think, “Okay, that then we seem to be set up for further progress.” But being\nseem to set up for it is one thing; having it is another. So we, we’re going to want to see further,\nfurther progress on inflation. Remember, we’re not, you know, we’re, we’re under—2 percent,\nbut our goal is 2 percent, and we do mean to get back sustainably to 2 percent.\nCATARINA SARAIVA. And, and in terms of the labor market, I mean, how—is that\nbroadly—you know, you said a broad set of indicators show that it’s in pretty solid place. Was\nthere broad agreement on that? There’s been a few underlying indicators that are showing\nPage 11 of 27\nJanuary 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nperhaps some weakness: a low hiring rate, you know, workers reporting that it’s increasingly\ndifficult to find a job. Is that of concern to the Committee?\nCHAIR POWELL. So you’re right. I mean, we look at, of course, a very broad range.\nAnd, so, it starts with unemployment—sorry, with, yeah, with the unemployment rate,\nemployment participation, wages, job quits—are people quitting?—that kind of thing. The ratio\nof vacancies to unemployed. We look at all those things, and you, you put your finger, though,\non—it’s a low—it’s a low-hiring environment. So if you have a job, it’s all—it’s all good, but if\nyou—if you have to find a job, the job-finding rate—the hiring rates have come down. And\nthat’s, that’s more typical of a—let’s say—let’s say that the unemployment—that the—that the\nlabor market is at a sustainable level. It’s not overheated anymore. We don’t think we need it to\ncool off anymore. We do watch it extremely carefully. It’s one of our two goal variables. But,\nyeah, I, I’d say we watch those things quite carefully. But nonetheless, overall, look at the\naggregate data in the labor market. It does seem to—the labor market does seem, seem to be\npretty stable and broadly in balance. When you’ve got a, an unemployment rate that is—that has\nbeen pretty stable now for, for a, a full half a year.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Edward.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Edward Lawrence\nwith Fox Business. On employment, now, you said there’s a broad range of possibilities, but last\nSeptember you said, quote, “We understand that there’s been quite an influx across the borders,\nand that has actually been one of things that’s allowed unemployment rate to rise.” Now that the\nflow over the border has slowed and we’re seeing deportations, how do you expect the\nunemployment rate to react?\nPage 12 of 27\nJanuary 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, so what’s happening is that the, the flows across the\nborder have decreased very significantly, and there’s every reason to expect that to continue.\nAnd so—but job creation has come down a bit, too, so, you know, if those two things come\ndown together, that, that sort of can be a reason for the unemployment rate to stabilize. In other\nwords, a breakeven rate—as, as population growth slows, the breakeven rate that you need in\nnew jobs to make—to, to make jobs for, for workers declines as well. So that seems to be\nsomething about what’s happening. You, you do see a very—a very flat unemployment rate at a\ntime when you’ve seen significant declines [in job growth].\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. I want to ask you about Fed employment. I know that tax\nmoney is not used here, but Elon Musk alleges that the Fed is, quote, “absurdly overstaffed.”\nWe’ve seen the Executive Branch push to reduce the federal workforce. I just want to get your\nreaction.\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, we, we run a very careful budget process where we’re\nfully aware that what, that, you know, we owe the—we owe that to the public, and we believe we\ndo that. I, I’ve got no further comment than that, thanks.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Chris.\nCHRIS RUGABER. Chris Rugaber at Associated Press. President Trump has said he\nwill lower inflation by reducing gas and energy costs. Do you see such costs as a particular\ndriver of inflation, and would lowering them have a dramatic effect?\nCHAIR POWELL. Chris, I’m not going to—I’m not going to react or discuss anything\nthat, that any elected politician might say. So I’ll give you a mulligan.\nCHRIS RUGABER. Okay, oh, thank you. Well, nearly two weeks ago the Fed said it\nwas withdrawing from the Network for Greening the Financial System even as, you know, even\nPage 13 of 27\nJanuary 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nas we have significant wildfires in Los Angeles doing billions of dollars in damage. And, of\ncourse, the NGFS, as you know, is a group to talk about how the financial system could address\nclimate change. Many commentators did see the timing as political. Why did you leave that\norganization? Can you explain that decision?\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure, I’d be glad to. So we considered this, you know, really at\nlength, and we did decide to withdraw from the NGFS. And, really, the reason is that the, the\nwork that the NGFS does has broadened very significantly. Think about nature-related risks and\nbiodiversity and things like that. In addition, the, the work of the NGFS is, is, in, in significant\npart intended to—and this is a quote—“mobilize mainstream finance to support the transition\ntoward a sustainable economy.” So we joined to get the benefit of understanding what other\ncentral banks were doing and, and seeing research and things like that. I think this is just way\nbeyond any plausible mandate that you could attribute to the Fed, and so we have a quite narrow\nrole, as I’ve—as I’ve said many times, and I think that, that the activities of the NGFS are not a\ngood fit for the Fed, given our current mandate and authority. So, you know, and I just think it\nwas time to acknowledge that. You know, the, the process—this process dates back—thinking\nabout it dates back a couple of years. I made the decision to bring this to the Board, you know,\nsome months ago. It just—it just—the process just took time to get here, and, and this is when—\nthis is when we, we got in and voted on it, so. And I’m aware of how it can look, but it was\nreally not driven by politics; it was driven by kind of the disconnect between the work of the\nNGFS and our mandate. Other central banks have different mandates and belong to the NGFS.\nWe have no, no criticism of them. But it just isn’t—it’s not right for the Fed.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Andrew.\nPage 14 of 27\nJanuary 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nANDREW ACKERMAN. Thanks. Andrew Ackerman with the Washington Post. I’m\nwondering if you could talk more about what further progress would look like for consumers.\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, 2 percent—inflation down to—inflation down to 2 percent\nsustainably is what, what we’re trying to achieve. You know, we’re, we’re somewhat above that,\nas you know, and, you know, we, we want to see, you know, serial readings that suggest that\nwe’re making further progress on inflation. That’s what we want to see. And consumers will,\nwill pick that up, of course, in the things that they buy at the grocery store or at the store.\nANDREW ACKERMAN. The other thing I wanted to ask was just how far away you\nthink you are from neutral.\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah, you can’t know with any precision, of course. As I like to say,\nthat you know that—you know the neutral rate by its works. So I think, you know, at 4.3 percent\nwe’re, we’re above pretty much everyone on the Committee’s estimates of the longer-run\nneutral. I think our eyes are telling us that our policy is having the effects on the economy.\nThat’s really the question we ask. You know, you can consult models, empirical models,\ntheoretical models. You really have to just look out the window and see how your—how your\npolicy rate is affecting the economy. And I think we see that it’s having meaningful effects in\nbringing inflation under control. It has helped bring the labor market into balance as well. So\nthat’s what we think. I, I would say we’re meaningfully above it. I, I am—I, I have no illusion\nthat, that anyone knows precisely how much that is. And, but it, you know—not knowing that,\nand having cut 100 basis points, means that it’s appropriate that we—that we not be in a hurry to\nmake further adjustments.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Victoria.\nPage 15 of 27\nJanuary 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Victoria Guida with Politico. So, as a general matter, when it\ncomes to executive orders and OMB memos, do those always apply to the Fed, sometimes,\nnever, or do you just often voluntarily comply? What is—what is the legality there?\nCHAIR POWELL. So it’s been—it’s been our practice, as I mentioned, to work to align\nour policies to those that are mentioned in, in the executive orders. And that’s—I’m just going\nto leave it at that. As I mentioned, I’m not going to—I’m not going to go any deeper than that\nor, or get into any deeper into this set of issues today.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Claire.\nCLAIRE JONES. Claire Jones from the Financial Times. Two questions, if I may, on\ntariffs. Well, first of all, we’ve seen global trade wars before, notably in 2019 last time around.\nBut then we were then in a very different place on both inflation and growth. If we see tariffs of\nthe same sort of magnitude that we got then—which I know is a big if—what do you think might\nbe different this time around? And, secondly, Tiff Macklem said there was no doubt that the\nthreat of tariffs was a big driver of the cut by the Bank of Canada today. What sort of\ninformation would the Fed need to see on tariffs before it was willing to take such a preemptive\nmove? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Sorry, make a—?\nCLAIRE JONES. To—what sort of information would you need to see on tariffs?\nWould you need to see a strategy, actual implementation, actual movement of inflation\nexpectations, before you’re actually willing to change the path of monetary policy on the basis of\nit?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we just—so first of all, thing, things are a little different now.\nWe’ve just come through a high-inflation period, and you can argue that both ways. You can—\nPage 16 of 27\nJanuary 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nyou can say that companies have figured out that they do like to raise prices, but, but we also\nhear a lot from companies these days that consumers have really had it with price increases, and\nso I don’t know how that shakes out. Nonetheless, you’re coming through a situation where\nwe’re not quite back to 2 percent, and that, that’s just different.\nIn addition, you know, the trade—the kind of footprint of trade is, has changed a, a lot, as\ntrade is now spread around the, you know—it’s not as concentrated in China as it was. There\nwas a lot more manufacturing. It moved to Mexico and other places. So, so there were\ndifferences, and I just think the, the range of possibilities is, is very, very wide. We just don’t\nknow, and I, I don’t want to start speculating, as tempting as it is, because we really don’t know.\nAnd we didn’t know, by the way, in, I guess, 2018. Yeah, we didn’t really know. And it, you\nknow, the—again, the range of possibilities, very, very wide. We don’t know what’s going to be\ntariff. We don’t know for how long or how much, what countries. We don’t know about\nretaliation. We don’t know how it’s going to transmit through the economy to consumers.\nThat’s, that really does remain to be seen. You know, there are lots of places where that—where\nthat—where that price increase from the tariff can show up between the manufacturer and a\nconsumer. Just so many variables. So we’re just going to have to wait and see. And, you know,\nthe best we can do is what we’ve done, which is study up on this and, you know, look at\nhistorical experience, read the literature, and think about the factors that might matter, and then\nwe’ll just have to see—have to see how it—how it goes.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Courtenay.\nCOURTENAY BROWN. Thank you. Courtenay Brown from Axios. Two unrelated\nquestions. The first is whether or not there was any discussion about QT and the timeline for\nending QT at this meeting. And then the second question is just—I wonder if the AI-prompted\nPage 17 of 27\nJanuary 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nselloff in the stock market this week signaled anything to you about the state of financial\nconditions.\nCHAIR POWELL. So, on QT, on—let’s, let’s talk about runoff. So the most recent data\ndo suggest that reserves are still abundant. Reserves remain roughly as high as they were when\nrunoff began. And the federal funds rate has been very steady within the target range. We track\na, a bunch of metrics, and they do tend to point to, to reserves being abundant. We do intend to\nreduce the size of our balance sheet to a level that’s consistent with implementing monetary\npolicy efficiently and effectively in our ample-reserves regime. We’re closely monitoring a, a\nrange of indicators to assess conditions, and that should provide signals whether reserves are\napproaching a level that could be judged as, quote, “somewhat above ample.” I, I don’t have\nanything to say to you about particular dates; it’s just that’s the process, and what we see is, is\nthat, that rates do appear to be abundant. As always, we stand ready to take appropriate action to\nsupport the smooth transition of monetary policy, including to adjust the details of our approach\nfor reducing the size of the balance sheet in light of economic and financial developments.\nOn, on AI, it’s a big event in, in the stock market and in particular parts of the stock\nmarket. I mean, what, what really matters for us is macro developments, and that means\nsubstantial changes in financial conditions that are persistent for a period of time. So I wouldn’t\nput that label on, on these events, although of course we’re all watching it with interest.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Simon.\nSIMON RABINOVITCH. Simon Rabinovitch with the Economist, thank you. You\nmentioned in your remarks that activity in the housing sector seems to have stabilized. At the\nsame time, since your first rate cut in September, long-term mortgage rates have gone up by a\nfull percentage point, back above 7 percent. I’m wondering, kind of looking forward, do you\nPage 18 of 27\nJanuary 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthink—are you confident that activity will remain stable, given how elevated mortgage rates are?\nHow does it fit into your broader thinking about the economy?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, as you know, as we’ve reduced our, our policy rate 100 basis\npoints, longer rates have gone up. Not because of expectations—not principally because of\nexpectations about our policy or about inflation; it’s more a term premium story. So, and, you\nknow, it’s long rates that matter for, for housing. So I, I don’t think—I think these higher rates\nare going to—they’re, they’re probably hold back housing activities to some extent, if they’re\npersistent. We’ll have to see how long they persist. So, you know, we, we are—we control an\novernight rate. Generally, it, it propagates through the whole family of asset prices, including\ninterest rates. But in this particular case, it’s all happened at a time when, for reasons unrelated\nto our policy, longer rates have moved up.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jennifer.\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. Thank you, Chair Powell. Jennifer Schonberger with\nYahoo Finance. You said you want to see further progress on inflation. Given that households\nappear to be unhappy with the elevated level of prices, do you believe the Committee should\nwait until inflation has fallen back to target to cut rates again?\nCHAIR POWELL. No, I wouldn’t say that. We, we’ve never said we need to be all the\nway at target to reduce rates. At, at any time, what we’re doing is we’re looking at the economy\nand asking whether our policy stance is the right one to achieve maximum employment and price\nstability. So I, I think if—we would want to see further progress, but we think our—we think\nour—as I mentioned, we think that our policy stance is restrictive. Meaningfully restrictive. Not\nhighly restrictive, but meaningfully restrictive. And so I would think we need to see further\nPage 19 of 27\nJanuary 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nprogress. I wouldn’t say all the way back down to 2 percent on a sustainable basis, although\nwe’d love to see that, of course, and we will.\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. And a separate question for you, on tariffs. Curious\nwhether the threat of tariffs and not knowing whether they could stick or not creates uncertainty\nfor business here in the United States and could cause them to pull back, ultimately weighing on\ngrowth. Does the threat of tariffs cause you to ponder your growth forecast?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, we—I want to avoid commenting, even indirectly, on the\nconduct of tariffs. You know, it’s not our job, and it’s not our job to comment on the moves that\npeople make. So I, I wouldn’t want to criticize anything that’s happening or really comment on\nit one way or another—praise it, for that matter. It’s just not our job.\nI do think that—you know, we found in, in 2018, [when] there was a lot of work done on\ntrade policy uncertainty, trade policy uncertainty, if it’s large and persistent, can start to matter\nfor businesses making investment decisions and things like that. That’s not something I’m\nobserving today. It’s very early days for this. But that did—I think that did matter in 2018–19.\nAnd, and it’s one, you know, one of many things we’ll be watching.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Matt Egan.\nMATT EGAN. Thank you, Chair Powell. Matt Egan from CNN. Following up on\nCourtenay’s question from earlier about the stock market, how concerned are you, if at all, about\npotential asset bubble brewing in financial markets? How do relatively high market valuations\nfactor into considerations about potentially lowering interest rates further? Is that something\nthat’s in the back of your mind?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we, we look—we look at, from a financial stability perspective, at\nasset prices generally, along with things like leverage in the household sector, leverage in the\nPage 20 of 27\nJanuary 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nbanking system, funding risk for banks, and things like that. But it’s just one of the four things,\nasset prices are. And, yeah, I, I’d say they’re elevated by, by many metrics right now. A good\npart of that, of course, is this thing around tech and AI, but we, we look at that. But, you know,\nwe also—we look at how resilient the households and, and businesses and the financial sector are\nto those things. So we look at that mainly from our financial stability perspective, and we think\nthat there’s a lot of resilience out there. Banks have high capital, and households are actually,\noverall—not all households, but in, in the aggregate, households are in pretty good shape\nfinancially these days. So that’s how we think about that. I, you know, we, we also—we look at\noverall financial conditions, and you’ve got—you can’t just take—you can’t just take equity\nprices. You’ve got to look at rates, too, and that, you know, that represents a, a tightening in\nconditions, with higher rates. So, overall, financial conditions are probably still somewhat\naccommodative, but it’s a mixed bag.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Richard.\nRICHARD ESCOBEDO. Hi, Chair Powell. I’m Richard Escobedo with CBS News.\nOne question for you. This month’s statement notes that unemployment has stabilized at a low\nrate and that the labor market is solid. You walked through some of what’s driving this, but I\nwonder what risks you see that might challenge your assessment.\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, the things we watch, we discussed earlier. One, one is, is that\nthere’s a low hiring rate. And so that if, if there were to be a spike in layoffs, if companies were\nto start to reduce headcount, you would see unemployment go up pretty quickly, because the\nhiring rate is quite low. So that, that’s one thing we look at.\nI think it’s also—it’s worth pointing out that for lower-income households, they are—\nthey’re under significant pressure. And in the aggregate, the numbers are good, but we know\nPage 21 of 27\nJanuary 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthat people at the lower end of the income spectrum are, are struggling with, with costs. And,\nreally, it’s, it’s high inflation for the basics of life. It’s not so much the inflation now; it’s the\nprice level, because inflation has raised prices. Inflation is now closer—much closer to target,\nbut people are really feeling that. But, you know, overall, this is a good labor market. Here\nyou’re at 4.1 percent unemployment. That’s, that’s just a really good level, and you’ve been\nsolidly there now for six, seven months. And job creation is pretty close to a level that will hold\nthe unemployment rate there, given, given that, you know, there’ll be much slower population\ngrowth.\nRICHARD ESCOBEDO. One more question. Some of the uncertainty around\nimmigration policy. Is—in your assessment, is that making it harder for businesses and the Fed\nto plan going forward?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, we hear anecdotal reports, but I, I don’t see—there’s\nnothing in the data yet on that. But you do—you hear—you hear that kind of thing about\nconstruction, for example. And, and, you know, businesses that are dependent on immigrant\nlabor are, are saying that it’s, it’s suddenly gotten harder to, to get people. But I, again—I\nknow—you don’t see that in the aggregate data yet, but yes, you, you hear it anecdotally.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nick.\nNICHOLAS JASINSKI. Thank you, Chair Powell. Nicholas Jasinski from Barron’s.\nThe uncertainty is certainly a theme today, and I’m wondering, are there any periods from your\ncareer, or as it relates to markets, the economy, what’s going on here in Washington and beyond,\nor from lessons from history, that may provide some guidance for a central banker operating in\nuncertain times like today?\nPage 22 of 27\nJanuary 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. I guess I’d say this: Uncertainty is, is with us all the time. It’s, it is\nhuman nature, apparently, to underestimate the—how fat the tails are, in a way, that, you know,\nthe, the possibility—we think of things in a normal distribution, and in the economy it’s not a\nnormal distribution. The tails are very fat, meaning things can happen way out of your\nexpectations. It’s never not that way. I wouldn’t—you know, if you—if you think about it—\nthink about the first few months of the pandemic. That was uncertainty. Are we going to be able\nto reopen the economy? If so, when? How much of it? How long will it take? You know, that\nwas uncertainty. What we have now is a good labor market. We have the economy growing at,\nyou know, 2 to 2½ percent. Inflation’s come down to, to now the, you know—the headline\ninflation number was 2.6 [percent], and that’s what the public experiences. We look at—we look\nat core because it’s a better indicator of future inflation. So, yes, the price level went up a lot for\ninflation, and people are feeling that, and, and they’re not wrong. But I—so the kind of\nuncertainty we have is just a, a usual level of uncertainty about the economy. But then\npolicies—which are, you know, not for us to criticize or, or praise, really—those are—those are\npolicies which people are, have been elected to implement. They’re implementing them with a\nview to, to making a better economy. And so I, I don’t think—I wouldn’t call this out as, as a—\nas one of those times. I wouldn’t compare it to the Global Financial Crisis or anything like that,\ngiven that we have actually a very good economy right now.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Evan.\nEVAN RYSER. Evan Ryser with Market News International. Chair Powell, is a March\ncut still on the table? And then, additionally, are you looking to see better-than-expected data on\ninflation to cut, or are you looking for inflation data that roughly aligns with current forecasts?\nPage 23 of 27\nJanuary 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. So, as, as I mentioned, the economy’s strong, the labor market’s\nsolid, downside risks to the labor market appear to have abated, and we think disinflation\ncontinues on a slow and sometimes bumpy path. That tells me and the other members of the\nCommittee—the broad sense of the Committee, actually, is that we don’t need to be in a hurry to\nadjust our policy stance. Your second question was?\nEVAN RYSER. Whether or not you need to see better-than-expected inflation data or\njust inflation data that roughly aligns with your current forecasts.\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, it’s one of those things we’ll know it when we see it. But\nmore, more the—the expectation is that we will make continued progress, and, you know, that’s\nwhat we want. We, we’ll know it when we see it. When we—it, it’s going to have to be\nsomething that isn’t just idiosyncratic. You’re going to want to see, you know, continued\nprogress with housing services inflation; you’re going to want to see inflation behaving in a way\nthat builds confidence that we are really making progress. That’s what it’s going to be. And, I\nmean, is, is that better than our expectations? If we expect to see that, it’s just a question of\nwhen.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Scott.\nSCOTT HORSLEY. Hi, Chair Powell. Scott Horsley from NPR. In your five-year\nreview, you said the, the 2 percent inflation target won’t be on the table. Can you talk a little\nabout why? Is that because you think that’s the right target, or is it because you don’t want to\nmove the goalpost midgame, or what’s, what’s behind that?\nCHAIR POWELL. I think to—I think that goal has served us well over a long period of\ntime. It’s also the sort of global standard. I think that if, if a central bank wanted to look at\nchanging that, you wouldn’t do it at a time when you’re not meeting it anyway. I would not look\nPage 24 of 27\nJanuary 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nat changing it anyway, but I certainly wouldn’t look at, at it at a time when you’re not—when\nyou’re not meeting it. I mean, there’s just no interest at all in changing it, if, if I’m being at all\nunclear. We’re not—we’re not going to change the inflation goal any time soon.\nSCOTT HORSLEY. And, and five years ago, if I can paraphrase what you all decided, it\nwas you’re going to not raise interest rates preemptively to, to head off inflation until you see\nsort of the whites of the eyes of inflation, because the solid labor market was so beneficial. Have\nthe last few years changed your thinking about that?\nCHAIR POWELL. So what we really said was that we wouldn’t—we wouldn’t look at\na—at a strong labor market and raise rates unless we saw some evidence of inflation. So the\nthought was that we’d seen really low levels of inflation—sorry, of unemployment—with no\nsign of inflation. So why would you preemptively want to—want to put people out of work in\nthe absence of, of any kind of—any evidence that suggested that, that this was not a sustainable\nlevel? It was a way of, of acknowledging how much humility we have about, about the starred\nvariables, especially u*, the natural rate of unemployment. So, that was a—that, that was an\ninsight. We’ll, we’ll discuss that again. That’ll be one of the many things that we discuss. But I\ndon’t think that insight is wrong. We didn’t—you know, we, we—what we said was that, you\nknow, in—at times when inflation persistently undershot 2 percent, we, we would likely allow\ninflation to run moderately above 2 percent for some time. That’s what we said. That was—\nturned out not to be relevant to what actually happened. There was nothing moderate about the\novershoot. It was—it was an exogenous event. It was the pandemic, and it happened, and, you\nknow, our framework permitted us to act quite vigorously, and we did once we decided that\nthat’s what we should do. Our framework had really nothing to do with the decision to—we, we\nlooked at the inflation as, as transitory, and—right up to the point where the data turned against\nPage 25 of 27\nJanuary 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthat, and when the data turned against that in late ’21, we changed our, our view, and we raised\nrates a lot, and here we are at 4.1 percent unemployment and inflation way down. But the\nframework was, was more irrelevant than anything else. The, the, that part of it—that part of it\nwas irrelevant. The rest of the framework worked just fine as, as we used it, as it supported what\nwe did to bring inflation down.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Go to Mark for the last question.\nMARK HAMRICK. Hello, Chairman Powell. Mark Hamrick with Bankrate. As you\nknow, in the annual report from the Financial Stability Oversight Council, among the risks\noutlined is cryptocurrency. Could you talk about those risks now? And regarding individuals\nand households, perhaps distinct from the concern about the financial system, do you worry that\nspeculation in this unregulated asset class could hurt their financial well-being, or do you think it\nhas a place in a household’s portfolio?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, so our, our role with Bitcoin, really, is to look at—with\ncrypto, really, is to look at the banks, and, and, you know, we, we think it’s—you know, banks\nare perfectly able to serve crypto customers, as long as they understand and can manage the risks\nand its safe, safe and soundness. Many of our—a good number of our banks that we regulate and\nsupervise do that. You know, the threshold has been a little higher for banks engaging in crypto\nactivities, and that’s because they’re so new, and, you know, we don’t want to make the mistake\nyou’re—if you—if you’re making a choice to conduct that activity inside a bank which is inside\nthe federal safety net, with deposit insurance, then you want to be pretty sure that, that it’s a safe\nand sound activity. So, you know, we’re, we’re not against innovation, and we certainly don’t\nwant to, to take actions that would cause banks to, you know, to terminate customers who are\nPage 26 of 27\nJanuary 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nperfectly legal just because of, of excess risk aversion maybe related to regulation and\nsupervision, so.\nMARK HAMRICK. And with respect to households and their inclusion in that asset\nclass?\nCHAIR POWELL. I, you know, that’s, that’s kind of a—it’s not really our, our\nbailiwick. You want people to be knowledgeable about the financial engagements that they\nhave, and that’s why we have, you know, the securities law, laws that we have. It’s why, you\nknow, if you read a mutual fund prospectus or individual stock prospectus, you, you want\nhouseholds to have the chance to understand the risk that they’re taking. And, you know, I, I do\nthink it would be helpful if there were a greater regulatory apparatus around crypto, and I think\nthat, that’s something Congress was working on quite a lot. We’ve actually spent a lot of time,\nyou know, with members of Congress working together with them on, on various things, and I, I\nthink that would be a very constructive thing for, for Congress to do.\nThank you.\nPage 27 of 27"

    "press_conf": "March 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nTranscript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference\nMarch 19, 2025\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on\nachieving our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of\nthe American people. The economy is strong overall and has made significant progress toward\nour goals over the past two years. Labor market conditions are solid, and inflation has moved\ncloser to our 2 percent longer-run goal, though it remains somewhat elevated.\nIn support of our goals, today the Federal Open Market Committee decided to leave our\npolicy interest rate unchanged. We also made the technical decision to slow the pace of decline\nin the size of our balance sheet. I’ll have more to say about these decisions after briefly\nreviewing economic developments.\nEconomic activity continued to expand at a solid pace in the fourth quarter of last year,\nwith GDP rising at 2.3 percent. Recent indications, however, point to a moderation in consumer\nspending following the rapid growth seen over the second half of 2024. Surveys of households\nand businesses point to heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook. It remains to be\nseen how these developments might affect future spending and investment. In our Summary of\nEconomic Projections, the median participant projects GDP to rise 1.7 percent this year,\nsomewhat lower than projected in December, and to rise a bit below 2 percent over the next two\nyears.\nIn the labor market, conditions remain solid. Payroll job gains averaged 200,000 per\nmonth over the past three months. The unemployment rate, at 4.1 percent, remains low and has\nheld in a narrow range for the past year. The jobs-to-workers gap has held steady for several\nmonths. Wages are growing faster than inflation and at a more sustainable pace than earlier in\nthe pandemic recovery. Overall, a wide set of indicators suggests that conditions in the labor\nPage 1 of 28\nMarch 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nmarket are broadly in balance. The labor market is not a source of significant inflationary\npressures. The median projection for the unemployment rate in the SEP is 4.4 percent at the end\nof this year and 4.3 percent over the next two years.\nInflation has eased significantly over the past two years but remains somewhat elevated\nrelative to our 2 percent longer-run goal. Estimates based on the consumer price index and other\ndata indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.5 percent over the 12 months ending in February and\nthat, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent. Some\nnear-term measures of inflation expectations have recently moved up. We see this in both\nmarket- and survey-based measures, and survey respondents, both consumers and businesses, are\nmentioning tariffs as a driving factor. Beyond the next year or so, however, most measures of\nlonger-term expectations remain consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal. The median\nprojection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 2.7 percent this year and 2.2 percent next year, a\nlittle higher than projected in December. In 2027, the median projection is at our 2 percent\nobjective.\nOur monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people. At today’s meeting, the Committee\ndecided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4¼ to 4½ percent. Looking\nahead, the new Administration is in the process of implementing significant policy changes in\nfour distinct areas: trade, immigration, fiscal policy, and regulation. It is the net effect of these\npolicy changes that will matter for the economy and for the path of monetary policy. While there\nhave been recent developments in some of these areas, especially trade policy, uncertainty\naround the changes and their effects on the economic outlook is high. As we parse the incoming\ninformation, we’re focused on separating the signal from the noise as the outlook evolves. As\nPage 2 of 28\nMarch 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nwe say in our statement, in considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the\ntarget range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess incoming data, the evolving\noutlook, and the balance of risks. We do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance,\nand we are well positioned to wait for greater clarity.\nIn our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an\nappropriate path for the federal funds rate, based on what each participant judges to be the most\nlikely scenario going forward—an admittedly challenging exercise at this time in light of\nconsiderable uncertainty. The median participant projects that the appropriate level of the\nfederal funds rate will be 3.9 percent at the end of this year and 3.4 percent at the end of next\nyear, unchanged from December. While these individual forecasts are always subject to\nuncertainty, as I noted, uncertainty today is unusually elevated. And, of course, these projections\nare not a Committee plan or a decision.\nPolicy is not on a preset course. As the economy evolves, we will adjust our policy\nstance in a manner that best promotes our maximum-employment and price-stability goals. If\nthe economy remains strong and inflation does not continue to move sustainably toward\n2 percent, we can maintain policy restraint for longer. If the labor market were to weaken\nunexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we can ease policy\naccordingly. Our current policy stance is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties\nthat we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.\nAt today’s meeting, we also decided to slow the pace of decline in our balance sheet.\nSince we began balance sheet runoff, our securities holdings have declined by more than $2\ntrillion. While market indicators continue to suggest that the quantity of reserves remains\nabundant, we have seen some signs of increased tightness in money markets. Beginning in\nPage 3 of 28\nMarch 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nApril, the monthly cap on Treasury redemptions will be lowered from $25 billion to $5 billion.\nConsistent with the Committee’s intention to hold primarily Treasury securities in the longer run,\nwe are leaving the cap on agency securities unchanged. This action has no implications for our\nintended stance of monetary policy and should not affect the size of our balance sheet over the\nmedium term.\nThe Committee also continued its discussions as part of our five-year review of our\nmonetary policy framework. At this meeting, we focused on labor market dynamics and our\nmaximum-employment goal. As we have indicated, our review will include outreach and public\nevents involving a wide range of parties, including Fed Listens events around the country and a\nresearch conference in May. Throughout this process, we will be open to new ideas and critical\nfeedback, and we will take on board lessons of the last five years in determining our findings.\nWe intend to wrap up the review by late summer.\nThe Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy: maximum employment and\nstable prices. We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation\nsustainably to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer-term inflation expectations well\nanchored. Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans. We understand\nthat our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we\ndo is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our\nmaximum-employment and price-stability goals.\nThank you. I will look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Howard.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Howard Schneider with Reuters. Thanks for your time. So\ntwo things on sort of the real side here, one inflation and then—and then GDP. How much of the\nPage 4 of 28\nMarch 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nhigher inflation forecast for this year is due to tariffs, and since the policy path remains the same,\nare you effectively reading this as a one-time price-level shock?\nCHAIR POWELL. Okay, so how much of it is, is tariffs? So let me say that it is going to\nbe very difficult to have a precise assessment of how much of inflation is coming from tariffs\nand from, from other—and that’s already the case. You may have seen that goods inflation\nmoved up pretty significantly in the first two months of the year. Trying to track that back to\nactual tariff increases, given what was tariffed and what was not—very, very challenging. So\nsome of it—the, the answer is clearly some of it—a good part of it is, is coming from tariffs. But\nwe’ll be—we’ll be working, and so will other forecasters, to try to find the best possible way to\nseparate nontariff inflation from tariff inflation.\nIn terms of the, the—your, your sort of looking-through question, too soon to say about\nthat. As, as I’ve mentioned, it, it can be the case that it’s appropriate sometimes to look through\ninflation if it’s going to go away quickly without action by, by us, if it’s transitory. And that can\nbe the case in the case of, of tariff inflation. I think that would depend on the, the tariff inflation\nmoving through fairly quickly and would depend critically, as well, on inflation expectations\nbeing well anchored—longer-term inflation expectations being well anchored.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Well, I, I guess I’m looking at the obvious here—the fact that\nthe policy path doesn’t change at all and inflation is unchanged in the outyears also. Doesn’t that\nimply you all have basically decided that there is no signal here and that it’s just going to—we’re\nback to “transitory” again?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think—I think that’s kind of the base case, but, as I said, it’s—\nwe really can’t know that. We’re going to have to see how things actually, actually work out.\nAnd the fact that there wasn’t much change—I think that’s, that’s partly because, you know, you\nPage 5 of 28\nMarch 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nsee—you see weaker growth but higher inflation. They kind of offset. And also, frankly, a little\nbit of inertia when it—when it comes to changing something in this highly uncertain\nenvironment. You know, you’re—you, you know, I think there is a level of inertia where you\njust say, “Maybe I’ll stay where I am.”\nMICHELLE SMITH. Colby.\nCOLBY SMITH. Thank you. Colby Smith with the New York Times. You just\ndescribed inflation expectations as well anchored, but has your confidence in that assessment\nchanged at all, given the increase in certain measures and the high degree of uncertainty\nexpressed by businesses, households, and forecasters?\nCHAIR POWELL. So our inflation expectations—of course, we do monitor inflation\nexpectations very, very carefully—basically, every source we can find, and, you know—short-\nterm, long-term, households, businesses, forecasters, market-based. And I think the picture,\nbroadly, is this: You do see increases widely in short-term inflation expectations. And people\nwho fill out surveys and answer, you know, questionnaires are pointing to tariffs about that. If\nyou look—in the survey world, if you look a little further out, you, you really—you really don’t\nsee much in the way of an increased longer-term inflation—inflation expectations are mostly\nwell anchored, if you look at the [series maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of] New York,\nfor example. Then you have market based, and it’s the same pattern. You know, people and\nmarkets are pricing in and, and breakevens, some higher inflation over the next year must be\nrelated to tariffs. We know from the surveys. But if you look out five years or five-year, five-\nyear forward, you’ll see that breakevens have—are either flat or, actually, slightly down in the\ncase of a longer-term one.\nPage 6 of 28\nMarch 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nSo we look at that, and we will be watching all of it very, very carefully. We do not take\nanything for granted. That’s at the very heart of our framework: anchored inflation\nexpectations. But what—that’s what you see right now.\nCOLBY SMITH. And, and how much weight do you put on the deterioration in\nconsumer confidence surveys? You said recently that this is perhaps not the best indication of\nfuture spending. But I’m curious, you know, what you think is behind this deterioration and, and\nto what extent it could be a leading indicator for hard data.\nCHAIR POWELL. So let’s start with the hard data. You know, we, we do see pretty\nsolid hard data still. So growth looks like it’s maybe moderating a bit, consumer spending\nmoderating a bit, but still at a solid pace. Unemployment’s 4.1 percent. Job creation, most\nrecently, has been at a healthy level. Inflation has started to move up now, we think partly in\nresponse to tariffs, and there may be a delay in further progress over the course of this year. So\nthat’s the hard data. Overall, it’s a solid picture. The, the survey data, [in the case of] both\nhousehold and businesses, show significant rise in uncertainty and significant concerns about\ndownside risks. So how do we think about that? And that’s—that is the question.\nAs I mentioned the other day, as you pointed out, the relationship between survey data\nand actual economic activity hasn’t been very tight. There have been plenty of times where\npeople are saying very down—downbeat things about the economy and then going out and\nbuying a new car. But we don’t know that that will be the case here. We will be watching very\ncarefully for signs of weakness in the real data. Of course we will. But I, I—you know, given\nwhere we are, we think our policy’s in a good place to react to, to what comes. And we think\nthat the right thing to do is, is to wait here for, you know, for greater clarity about, about what,\nwhat the economy’s doing.\nPage 7 of 28\nMarch 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nick.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, Chair\nGreenspan once defined price stability as, as an environment in which inflation is so low and\nstable over time that it doesn’t materially enter into the decisions of households and firms. Can\nyou say that today we have that price stability—that households and businesses are ignoring\nprice growth, or do you see, by an advanced psychology, big changes in inventories and surveys\nthat show consumers, at least in the short run, expect higher inflation?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I, I do like that definition a lot. In fact, I used it at the recent\nconference where I spoke. So I think a world where, where people can make their daily\neconomic decisions, and businesses, and they’re not having to think about the possibility of\nsignificantly high inflation—we know inflation will bounce around. That’s, that is price\nstability. You know, I think we were getting closer and closer to that. I wouldn’t say we were at\nthat. Inflation was running around 2½ percent for some time. I do think with the arrival of, of\nthe tariff inflation, further progress may be delayed, if the SEP doesn’t really show further\ndownward progress on inflation this year. And that, that’s really due to the tariffs coming in.\nSo, delayed, but if you look at our forecast, we do see ourselves getting back into the low 2s in\n’26 and then down to 2 [percent] by ’27—of course, highly uncertain. So I see progress having,\nhaving been made toward that, and then progress in the future. I think that progress is probably\ndelayed for the time being.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. If that’s the case, why are there cuts in the SEP for 2025?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, again, people wrote down two cuts the last time, and they look\nat—they look at the—you know, the—and they wrote down, you know, meaningful decline in\ngrowth out from 2.1 to 1.7 in 2025, a tick up in the unemployment rate, so not much there, but\nPage 8 of 28\nMarch 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ncore inflation up by three-tenths. And so those two kind of—those kind of balance each other\nout. So people—not everybody, but, on balance, people wrote down similar numbers. The\nchanges aren’t that big.\nThe other—the other factor, though, as I mentioned, is just really high uncertainty. What\nwould you write down? I mean, it’s just—it’s really hard to know how this is going to work out.\nAnd, again, we think our policy’s in a good place. We think it’s a good place where we can\nmove in the direction that—where we need to. But in the meantime, we, we—it’s, it’s really\nappropriate to wait for further clarity, and, of course, you know, the costs of doing that, given\nthat the economy is still solid, are very low.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Edward.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Edward Lawrence with Fox\nBusiness. So with near 4 percent unemployment rate, that should be low enough to bring people\nin from the sidelines in terms of hiring. But we’re seeing the hiring rates have been stuck at\n2023, 2024 levels. So, what’s going on there?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah, so that’s a feature of the—has been for some time, a feature of\nthis labor market. You have pretty high participation, accounting for aging. You’ve got wages\nthat are consistent with 2 percent inflation, assuming that we’re going to keep getting, you know,\nrelatively high productivity. We’ve got unemployment, you know, pretty close to its natural\nlevel. But job—the hiring rate is quite low, but so is the layoff rate. So the, the—you look at\ninitial claims or layoffs. So you’re not seeing people losing their jobs, but you’re seeing that\npeople who don’t have a job having to wait longer and longer. And, you know, the question is,\nwhich way does that break? If we were to see a meaningful increase in layoffs, then that would\nprobably translate fairly quickly into unemployment, because people are—you know, it’s, it’s\nPage 9 of 28\nMarch 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nnot a—it’s not a big hiring market. We’ve been watching that, and it’s just not in the data. It\nhasn’t happened. What we’ve had is, is a low-firing, low-hiring situation, and it seems to be in\nbalance now for, you know, for the last six, seven, eight months. That’s where we are. There’s\nhealthy levels of job creation, too. So, overall, it’s a labor market that’s in balance, and, you\nknow, we, we watch it very carefully.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. So then, have we seen the Administration—the new\nAdministration’s policies in the economic numbers yet? And when do you anticipate that\nhappening?\nCHAIR POWELL. In labor? Or in, in other—?\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. In labor and inflation, just across the economy. Have we\nstarted to see the new policies take effect in the numbers?\nCHAIR POWELL. I, you know, only in a—kind of an early way. I mean, it’s only been\na few months, right? You know, for example, the, the layoffs that are happening here are, you\nknow, they’re certainly meaningful to the people involved, and they may be meaningful to a\nparticular neighborhood or region or area, but at the national level, they’re not—they’re not\nsignificant yet. But we don’t know. We don’t know what—where that—how far that will go.\nWe’ll, we’ll find out much more.\nI mentioned that—you, you saw it—we’ve had two, two very strong goods inflation\nreadings in the last two months, which is very unexpected, and, I think, hard to trace it to specific\ntariffs. But it must have—it must have something to do with—it’s either noise and it’ll come\nback, and that—that’s very possible, too. But if it is persistent, then it must be to do with, you\nknow, people buying ahead of tariffs, or raising prices ahead of tariffs, and things like that.\nThat—those kinds of things happen, and they’re very, very hard to capture because so much of it\nPage 10 of 28\nMarch 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nis indirect. A great example is there—washing machines were tariffed in the last, last round of\ntariffs, and prices went up, but prices also went up on, on dryers, which were not tariffed. So the\nmanufacturers just, you know, they just kind of followed the crowd and, and raised it. So things\nhappen very indirectly, and so there’ll be a lot of work done in the coming months to, to try to\ntrace all that through. But, ultimately, though, it’s too soon to be seeing significant effects in\neconomic data.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Craig.\nCRAIG TORRES. Craig Torres from Bloomberg News. Thanks, Chair Powell. You\nsaid transitory price increases from tariffs are the base case—transitory is the base case. Wasn’t\nit the base case last time? And didn’t the FOMC forecast lower inflation ahead last time? And\nwasn’t the lesson that it quickly got into services, haircuts, daycare, everything else? And so I’m\njust wondering why the nine aren’t taking that on board and are cutting twice this year.\nCHAIR POWELL. When you say “last time,” are you talking about the last—\nCRAIG TORRES. Pandemic, yes—during the pandemic.\nCHAIR POWELL. You could have been talking about the last time there were tariffs.\nCRAIG TORRES. Okay.\nCHAIR POWELL. In which case, the inflation was, was transitory.\nCRAIG TORRES. Yeah.\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah. No—of course, we’re well aware of that. And, you know,\nit’s, it’s still the truth, if, if there’s an inflationary impulse that’s going to go away on its own, it’s\nnot the right policy to, to tighten policy, because by the time you have your effect, you’re—you\nknow, you’re—an effect that by—by design, you are lowering economic activity and\nemployment. And if that’s not necessary, you don’t want to do it. In real time, as we know, it’s\nPage 11 of 28\nMarch 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nhard to make that judgment. So—and, and we’re well aware, you know, of what happened,\nobviously, with, with the pandemic inflation. But, I mean, we have to look at this as a—as a\ndifferent situation. There’s, there are differences and similarities. I mean, it’s a different time.\nYou know, we haven’t had real price stability fully reestablished yet, and we have to keep that in\nmind. And, you know, we also have—we hear that people are very reluctant to take on—to, you\nknow, to, to allow prices to go up. At the same time, we hear that businesses are intending to\npass many of these prices through. So it’s hard to say how this is going to work out.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Steve, Steve Liesman, CNBC. Thanks for taking my question,\nMr. Chairman. The Bank of Canada in its last policy statement said, “Monetary policy cannot\noffset the impacts of a trade war. What it can and must do is ensure that higher prices do not\nlead to ongoing inflation.” I wonder if that kind of reflects your own sense of prioritization,\nfaced with higher prices and weaker growth—that the idea is, you have to take care of inflation.\nCHAIR POWELL. You know—so we, we have two goals, right? We have maximum\nemployment and price stability, and we have to balance those. And, you know, there can be\nsituations in which they are in tension, right? And we have, actually have a provision in our—in\nour consensus statement that says what we should do in that case. That’s a very challenging, you\nknow, situation for, for any central bank, and certainly for us. And so, what we say that we’ll do\nis, we’ll, we’ll look how far each of those two goals is—each of those two measures is from its\ngoal, and then we’ll ask how long we think it might take to get back to the goal for each of them,\nand we’ll make a judgment, because our, you know, our tools work in one direction. We’re\neither tightening or loosening. So it’s a very challenging situation. Let me say, we don’t have\nthat situation right now. That’s not what the—that’s not where the economy is at all. It’s also\nPage 12 of 28\nMarch 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nnot where the forecast is. I don’t know any mainstream forecast that really shows significant\nproblems like that, so—\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Well, just to follow up, yesterday the UCLA Anderson Forecast said\nthere’s—a high probability of a recession. Where, where do you stand on whether or not the\nslowdown you’re seeing creates a higher probability or concern that you may have on recession?\nThank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, there’s always an unconditional probability—possibility\nof, of a recession. It might be broadly in the range of one in four at any time, if you look back\nthrough, through the years. It—there could be, within 12 months, a one in four chance of a\nrecession. So the question is, is whether that—whether this current situation, those possibilities\nare elevated. I will say this: We don’t—we don’t make such a forecast. If you look at outside\nforecasts, forecasters have, have generally raised—a number of them have raised their possibility\nof a—of a recession somewhat, but still at relatively moderate levels—you know, still in the\nregion of, of the traditional, because they were extremely low. If you go back two months,\npeople were saying that the, the likelihood of a recession was extremely low. So, has moved up,\nbut it’s not high.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Chris.\nCHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Hi. Thank you. Chris Rugaber at Associated Press. As\nyou know, I guess, last night the—President Trump fired two members of the Federal Trade\nCommission, an independent agency, and this could cause the kind of legal fight about the\nAdministration’s power to fire independent people. If those firings stand, is that a threat to the\nFed’s independence? Could he do the same thing to the Fed Board?\nPage 13 of 28\nMarch 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think I, I did answer that question in this very room some time\nago, and I, I [have] no desire to change that answer and have nothing new for you on that today.\nCHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Well, I just—okay, well, maybe I’ll have another\nmulligan. [Laughter] As you know, I, I wanted to go back to the consumer sentiment,\nparticularly the inflation expectations in the University of Michigan survey. In the summer of\n2022, you cited the rise in the long-term inflation expectations in that index as the reason that\nyou went big with a three-quarter-point hike. So I know you’ve—I mean, you’ve talked about\nall the different measures now, but you seem to not be placing the same weight on that. And so\nI’m just wondering, are you dismissing that, what we saw last week from the University of\nMichigan, or does that carry the same weight as it did in the past?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I, I mentioned it back then, but in no way did I place a huge\nweight on it. I think it, it—that was an ex post story, but it wasn’t the case. That was a\npreliminary reading, and so is this. And it’s also—this is—that, that Michigan, the one you’re\nreferring to, the longer-term thing—you know, we look at it, and we don’t dismiss data that we\ndon’t like. We, we force ourselves to look at it. But it is an outlier compared to market-based\nand compared to other survey-based assessments of longer-run inflation expectations, so we’ve\ngot to keep that in mind. And I, I—again, I, I would just say, we look at—we look at all of them.\nAnd that one—that one’s kind of an outlier, but, you know, nonetheless, we, we take notice of it.\nCHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Michael.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television. There is a\nworry on Wall Street that when you say you want to study the net effect of the fiscal policies, we\nmay see on the economy that you would end up waiting too long and be “behind the curve” in\nPage 14 of 28\nMarch 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nresponding to any downturn. How can you reassure people that you can spot a problem early\nenough, unless you decide to be preemptive?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah, look, we’re, we’re aware of the—we’re well aware of how\nthings are going to evolve and the time frames and all that, and, you know, we will—we will use\nour tools to foster achievement of our goals to the—to the best we can. And, of course, we’re\ngoing to try to be timely with that. For right now, the hard data are pretty solid. We, we are\nobviously aware of the soft sentiment data and high uncertainty, and we’re watching that\ncarefully. And we think it’s a, a good time for us to wait for further clarity before we consider\nadjusting our, our policy stance.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Do you think it’s going to be hard to get clarity in a “government\nby tweet”? I mean, do you have a, a feeling that at some point you actually will have a forecast\nyou can trust?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes, I think we will. I just—it’s hard to say when that will be. You\nknow, we’re—these decisions are going to be made, and they’re going to be implemented, and\nthen we’ll know. At that point, we’ll know what the decisions are, and we’ll have to make\nassessments then about their, their implications for the economy. Those things will happen. A\nlot of them will happen over the course of, you know, in coming months, certainly over the\ncourse of this year, and we’ll be adapting as we go.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Rachel.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Hi, Chair Powell. Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. Thank\nyou for taking our questions. At the beginning, you were talking about separating the signal\nfrom the noise, and tariff inflation from nontariff inflation. Can you “walk us through” what that\nPage 15 of 28\nMarch 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nlooked like over the last couple of months—if there were specifics, from the January meeting to\nnow, that helped you make those distinctions?\nCHAIR POWELL. So when we say “separating the signal from the noise,” that’s just a\nway of saying that things are highly uncertain and that, you know, you’re reading about\ndevelopments—the news is full of developments of tariffs being put on and taken off and things\nlike that. That’s—some of that is noise in the sense that it’s, it’s not really telling you anything.\nYou’re trying to extract a signal from that, and the signal is what’s going to be the effect on\neconomic activity, on inflation, on employment, and all those things. So, so that’s really when\nwe say “signal and noise.”\nSorry, the second thing was—?\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Or, similarly for tariff inflation, nontariff inflation, ways that you’re\nmaking the distinction.\nCHAIR POWELL. That’s, that’s sort of a, a special case of that—of, you know, with the\nidea being—and I think—do think that the first two months of this year are a great example.\nYou’ve got high readings for goods inflation after a string of readings that averaged close to\nzero, and you have to ask—it’s coming during tariffs, but, you know, you—it’s very hard to,\nactually, scientifically go back and match up those increases and say, “Yes, I can prove that\nthat’s from tariffs.” But it kind of has to be, to some extent. Plus, noise. There can be\nidiosyncratic readings in various categories, which will shortly reverse, and that, that happens,\ntoo, and that could be a big piece of it. You know, I think we’ll know. In a couple of months,\nwe’ll know whether those were—you know, where that really was from. But it’s a—that’s\nanother case where I think it’s going to be very, very challenging to unpack the inflation that we\nsee over the course of this year and be able to say with confidence how much of that came from\nPage 16 of 28\nMarch 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ninflation and how much of it—sorry, from tariffs—and how much of it didn’t. But that’s what\nwe’ll be doing. We’ll be doing that, and so will everybody else, and we’ll all be trying very hard\nto, to make that assessment. And, you know, I, I’m sure we will make a lot of progress on that.\nAnd we already have. But it, it’s going to be a challenge.\nRACHEL SIEGEL. Do you have a sense yet as to what, in your mind, what makes\nsomething cross from noise to a signal—what that threshold would look like?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, it would depend on what we’re talking about. I mean,\nobviously, you’re looking for direct evidence that, that particular pieces of, of inflation are, are—\nor are clearly not—caused by tariffs. For example, something that was, you know, in the service\nsector that was far away from anything that’s tariffed. You, you might think, okay, well that is—\nlike, frankly, housing services inflation—which, which, by the way, has been behaving well.\nYou know—which, for, for some time, was kind of our problem. Now it’s been—it’s slow, but\nit’s definitely, you know, moving down in a—in a very good way. It’s more now with goods\nand, to some extent, with, with nonhousing services inflation.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Kelly.\nKELLY O’GRADY. Thanks for taking our questions, Chair Powell. Kelly O’Grady,\nCBS News. So consumer sentiment has dipped dramatically, but you say the economy and the\nhard data is still solid. What is your message to consumers that clearly disagree and don’t feel\nthat strength? Because the hard data they’re looking at is their grocery bill.\nCHAIR POWELL. Okay, so a couple things. The grocery bill is about, about past\ninflation, really. There was inflation in ’21, ’22, and ’23, and prices went up. The current\nlevel—it’s not the change in prices. It’s, they’re unhappy—and, and they’re not wrong to be\nunhappy—that prices went up quite a bit, and they’re paying a lot for those things. So that’s—I\nPage 17 of 28\nMarch 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthink that is the fundamental fact and has been for a long time—a couple years—why people are\nunhappy with the—with the economy. It’s not that the economy’s not growing. It’s not that\ninflation’s really high. It’s not that unemployment is high. It’s none of those things. We have,\nyou know, 4.1 percent unemployment. We’ve got 2 percent growth, and, you know, it’s, it’s a\npretty good economy. But people are unhappy because of the price level. And, and I do—we\ncompletely understand and accept that.\nKELLY O’GRADY. And just to follow up: Why are you still projecting two rate cuts\nthis year if your own projections show inflation higher for longer? Does that mean you see a\nslowdown in economic growth as a real threat?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I, I think if you—yeah, I mean, remember, we came into this\nwith—at the December meeting, and the median was two cuts, the median was. And so you\ncome in, and you see, broadly speaking, weaker growth but higher inflation. And they kind of\nbalance each other out, so you think—and, and unemployment is really, really only, only a one-\ntenth change. So it’s—there’s just not a big change in the forecast. There really isn’t. Modest,\nyou know, meaningfully higher growth and meaningfully higher inflation, which call for\ndifferent responses, right? So they cancel each other out, and people just said, “Okay, I’m going\nto stay here.”\nBut the second factor is, it’s so highly uncertain. Is just—you know, we’re sitting here\nthinking—and we, we obviously are in, in touch with businesses and households all over the\ncountry. We have an extraordinary network of contacts that come in through the Reserve Banks\nand put it in the Beige Book—and also through contacts at the Board. And we get all that, and\nwe, we do understand that sentiment has fallen off pretty sharply, but economic activity has not\nyet. And so we’re watching carefully. So I would tell people that the economy seems to be—\nPage 18 of 28\nMarch 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nseems to be healthy. We understand that, that sentiment is, is quite negative at this time, and that\nprobably has to do with, you know, turmoil at the beginning of an Administration. It’s making,\nyou know, big changes in, in areas of policy, and that’s probably part of it. I do think the\nunderlying unhappiness people have about the economy, though, is more—is more about the\nprice level.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi. Victoria Guida with Politico. I wanted to ask, first of all, if\nyou could clarify. You were talking about how tariffs were a good part of the uptick in the\ninflation forecasts, and I was just wondering what that specifically refers to. Is that the tariffs\nthat have already been put in place? Is that anticipating some of the tariffs that might be coming\non April 2? And then also, if you wouldn’t mind talking a little more about the balance sheet\ndecision and what drove that. Did that have anything to do with expectations of how the debt\nceiling—raising the debt ceiling might affect the reserve supply?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah, so, in the SEP, you’ll see that there’s not further progress on\ncore inflation this year. We’re kind of side flatlining, going sideways. We don’t ask people to\nsay—to write down how much of this is from tariffs and how much of it is not. But some of it is\nfrom tariffs. We know that tariffs are coming, and we know that they’re probably already—all,\nall forecasters have tariff inflation affecting core PCE inflation [and] core CPI inflation this year,\nwithout exception. I’m not aware of an exception. So it’s in there. I can’t tell you how much of\nthat it is.\nIn terms of the balance sheet—so, yeah, we—I think—I guess the way I’d say it is, you\nknow, it was the flows in and out of the, the TGA that got us thinking about it, but as we, you\nknow, as we thought about it, we really came to the view that this was a good time to, to make\nPage 19 of 28\nMarch 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthe move that we made. And, broadly, Committee came around—came around to the view that\nwe, we would do the same thing we’d already done, which is, once we—I guess in June, we—\nwas it June? Whenever it was, we, we lowered the pace of QT, and we’re just going to do that\nagain. We’re going to cut it roughly in half. And the sense of that is, if you’re cutting the pace\nof QT roughly in half, then the runway is probably doubled, okay? So it’s going—it’s going to\nbe slower for longer. And people really liked that. People thought, “That’s, that’s a good idea.”\nYou know, it’s like a plane. You can think of it like a plane coming in for a landing. As we get\ncloser and we—by the way, we still think that reserves are abundant, although you begin to see\nsome of the—some of the things we look at begin to react a little bit, but we still think that\nthey’re abundant. And, of course, now, the TGA is emptying out, so reserves are, are higher\nnow, so you can’t really see the underlying signal. So we came around to the view, and, and it\nhad a lot of appeal, and so we did it. It really—it has no implications at all for monetary policy.\nIt has no implications at all for the ultimate size of the balance sheet. It isn’t sending a signal in\nany hidden way that you can try to tease out. It’s just not there. We’re, we’re basically—it’s\nvery consistent with our plans and our practices that we’ve published and that we’ve followed\nsince we began this—what is a very successful, you know, rundown of the balance sheet. Again,\n[this is] the second time that we’ve slowed the pace. And we’ve said that we would stop when\nwe were somewhat above the level [of reserves] we judge as ample. And, clearly, we’re not at\nthat level yet, but we’re going to be approaching it more slowly. It’s a commonsense kind of a—\nkind of a thing, and it had—it had pretty broad appeal, I will say.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Claire.\nCLAIRE JONES. Claire Jones, Financial Times. You said in January, Chair Powell,\nthat inflation expectations remained well anchored. Would you still say they remain well\nPage 20 of 28\nMarch 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nanchored today? And just to reiterate the question others have asked, if they’re not so well\nanchored, why hasn’t there been a more radical shift to the policy path today? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So when we—when we talk about inflation expectations being well\nanchored, we’re talking about longer-run inflation expectations. And they really haven’t moved\nmuch, I mean, if at all. There, there’s one reading that everyone’s focusing on that’s higher, but\nthe other survey readings and the market-based readings all show relatively, you know, well-\nanchored inflation expectations. You would expect that expectations of inflation over the course\nof a year would move around, because conditions change, and in this case, we have tariffs\ncoming in. We don’t know how big, what’s—there’s so many things we don’t know, but we\nkind of know there are going to be tariffs, and they tend to bring growth down. They tend to\nbring inflation up at the—in the first instance. So, so I would say, you, you know, I’m not\ndismissing what we’re seeing in short-term inflation expectations. We, as I mentioned, follow\nthat very carefully. But when we say expectations are well anchored, we’re really looking at,\nyou know, longer term, five year and out, and there’s really no story to tell five years and out,\neither in market based or, or in surveys. But we keep—we’ll watch it. I mean, we’re not, you\nknow, we’re, we’re not going to miss any evidence that longer-term or medium-term inflation\nexpectations are, are moving.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Neil.\nNEIL IRWIN. Hi, Chair Powell. Neil Irwin with Axios. Treasury Secretary Bessent has\nobserved that a large share of job growth over the last couple of years has been in what he calls\ngovernment or government-adjacent sectors—health care, education. Do you agree that there’s\nsome weakness in underlying private job growth, and do you see the composition of job growth\nas something that has policy implications?\nPage 21 of 28\nMarch 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. So that, that has been the case. We talked about that over the course\nof the last year. There were—there were some good number of months and times when a lot of\nthe job creation was, was concentrated in, you know, educational institutions, health care, state\ngovernments, things like that. There were also times when private-sector job growth has been\nmoving, moving in a healthy frame—and they’re all—they’re all jobs, but—and remember,\nwe’re, you know, we’re at very low unemployment for, you know, for, for quite a time now. So\nI, I think it’s a good labor market, but it’s—look, it’s something that we monitor carefully. From\nour standpoint, employment is employment. But I, you know—the, the elected government is\nentitled to have—you know, we, we don’t have policies that address different kinds of\nemployment. But, but the elected government has a—has a different role, and they can—they,\nthey can have those.\nNEIL IRWIN. True. Quick QT question: Does the Committee envision at some point\ntapering the MBS runoff, runoff as well?\nCHAIR POWELL. I think tapering it—I, I don’t know. There’s no plan to do that. You\nknow, at a certain point, we’ll stop runoff. And we may or may not stop MBS runoff, though,\nbecause, you know, we can—we can—we, we want to stop runoff in net at some point. We\nhaven’t made any decisions about that, but, you know, we, we want the—we want the MBS to\nroll off our balance sheet. We really, strongly desire that, so—but we haven’t made any\ndecisions about that, you know. We, we will—we—I think we’d, we’d look carefully at letting\nthat keep going, but hold the overall size of the balance sheet in, you know, constant, at some\npoint—a point that we’re not at yet.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Simon.\nPage 22 of 28\nMarch 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nSIMON RABINOVITCH. Simon Rabinovitch with the Economist. Thank you, Chair\nPowell. Several times today, you’ve said that you feel you’re well positioned to wait for greater\nclarity. At the same time, you could point to quite a few growth risks at the moment. We’ve\nseen a stock market that’s gone quite wobbly, rapidly cooling housing sales, plunging confidence\nsurveys. Today, not only did the SEP mark down the growth outlook, 17 of 19 see risks to the\ndownside. So my question is, how confident are you that you’re well positioned? Or is that one\nmore thing that you’re uncertain about?\nCHAIR POWELL. I’m confident that we’re well positioned in the sense that we’re,\nwe’re well positioned to move in the direction we’ll need to move. I, I mean, I, I don’t know\nanyone who has a lot of confidence in their forecast. I mean, the point is, we are—we are at, you\nknow, we’re at a place where we can cut or we—or we can hold what is a clearly a restrictive\nstance of policy. And that’s what I mean. I, I mean, I think we’re—that’s well positioned.\nForecasting right now, it’s—you know, forecasting is always very, very hard, and in the current\nsituation, I just think it’s—uncertainty is, you know, remarkably high.\nSIMON RABINOVITCH. And, sorry, standing here today, would you be surprised to, to\npivot back towards rate cuts in May?\nCHAIR POWELL. I, like, I, I think we’re not going to be in any hurry to move. And, as\nI mentioned, I think we’re, we’re well positioned to wait for further clarity, and not in any hurry.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Matt Egan.\nMATT EGAN. Matt Egan with CNN. Thank you, Chair Powell. The Fed’s statement\nreleased today removed the line that previously said “the Committee judges that the risks to\nachieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance.” Can you explain the\nPage 23 of 28\nMarch 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ndecision to remove that line? Does it mean that you’re now more concerned about inflation or\nabout employment?\nCHAIR POWELL. Actually, it does not mean either of those things. You know,\nsometimes with language they—it, it lives its, its useful life, and then we take it off, and we—\nand, and that was the case there. There’s really not meant to be any signal here. Over the past\nyear, you know, conveying this sense of the balance of risks was important that they be in\nbalance or close to being in balance. That was useful as we approach liftoff, if you remember.\nBut we’re past that. Or, I’m sorry, no—beginning, beginning to cut. So we just—so we just\ntook it out. I, I actually would say that the more important thing now about risks—and this is in,\nin pages like 10, 11, 12 of the SEP—if you look, participants widely raised their estimate of, of\nthe risks to our—of uncertainty, but also of the risks to growth in our employment and inflation\nmandates. That’s, that’s a more salient point now than whether they’re—whether they’re in\nbalance.\nMATT EGAN. Just on the, the stock market, the stock market has obviously declined\nsignificantly since the Fed last met. Are you concerned at all about some of the market volatility\nhaving a real economic impact in terms of hurting business spending or consumer spending,\nespecially among higher-income households?\nCHAIR POWELL. So financial conditions matter to us because, you know, financial\nconditions are the main channel to the real economy through which our policy has its effect. So,\nso they’re important. But what matters from, from a Fed standpoint for the macroeconomy is\nmaterial changes to overall financial conditions that are persistent, that last for a while—long\nenough to actually affect economic activity. So that’s what we’re looking for. I, I’m not going\nto opine on the appropriate level of any market—equity, debt, commodities, or anything like that.\nPage 24 of 28\nMarch 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nAnd I would just point you to the—to the bigger picture again. You know, the, the real\neconomy, the, the hard data are still in, in reasonably good shape. It’s the soft data—it’s the\nsurveys that are showing, you know, significant concerns, downside risks, and those kind of\nthings. We don’t dismiss that. We’re watching it carefully, but, you know, we, we don’t want to\nget ahead of that. You know, we, we want to focus on the hard data. This—if it’s—if that’s\ngoing to affect the hard data, we should know it very quickly, and, and, of course, we’ll, we’ll\nunderstand that. But you don’t see that yet.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jennifer.\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. Thank you, Chair Powell. Jennifer Schonberger with\nYahoo Finance. As you look to navigate higher inflation and lower growth, the Fed has talked\nabout heeding the lessons from the 1970s. Is the Fed willing to have a recession if it means\nbreaking the back of inflation?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, fortunately, we’re in a situation where we have seen inflation\nmove down from, you know, higher levels to pretty close to 2 percent, while the unemployment\nrate has remained very consistent with full employment, 4.1 percent. So we now have inflation\ncoming in from an exogenous source, but the underlying inflationary picture before that was, you\nknow, basically 2½ percent inflation, I would say, and 2 percent growth, and 4 percent\nunemployment. So, so that’s what—that’s what we did. That’s what, together, the economy\naccomplished. So I don’t see any reason to think that we’re looking at, at a replay of the ’70s or\nanything like that. You know, inflation—underlying inflation is, is, you know, still running in\nthe 2s, with probably a little bit of a pickup associated with tariffs. So I, I don’t think we’re\nfacing—I, I wouldn’t say we’re in, in a situation that’s remotely comparable to that.\nPage 25 of 28\nMarch 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. And last month, the idea of a DOGE dividend was\nproposed, which would send $5,000 checks to every taxpayer from DOGE savings. President\nTrump and Elon Musk have supported this. There’s reports there could be a bill introduced on\nCapitol Hill. What impact might that have on household savings and spending in terms of your\ngrowth and, and outlook for inflation?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, I—it’s not—it’s not appropriate for me to speculate on\npolitical ideas or, or fiscal policy, for that matter. So I’m going to—I’m going to pass on that\none. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Daniel.\nDANIEL AVIS. Hi, Chair Powell. Daniel Avis from Agence France-Presse. You\nmentioned that tariffs are already having at least some impact on inflation. I’m just wondering\nhow you and your colleagues on the FOMC have been thinking about the possibility of\nretaliatory tariffs from other countries, especially with April 2 coming up. Was it something you\nconsidered during this meeting? Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. So, since the very beginning, we’ve had kind of a placeholder—the\nstaff has a placeholder of—range of—really a range of possible outcomes from tariffs, and from\ntrade policy generally. And they generally assume full retaliation in those. And so that’s, that’s\nkind of baked into the numbers. What happens—it will be complicated, and there will be some\nretaliation and some not and, and all that, but, ultimately, they’re trying to, with the placeholder,\ngive us a broad sense of what this might look like. This—when we know—when we actually\nknow the specifics, we’ll be able to, to have still uncertain but, you know, better-informed\nforecasts. So, so, yes, that’s in there.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Last question goes to Jean.\nPage 26 of 28\nMarch 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nJEAN YUNG. Hi, Chair Powell. Jean Yung with MNI Market News. Had a couple\nquestions on the balance sheet change that you made. So the minutes had initially described\nyour discussion on slowing QT as temporary, until the debt ceiling is resolved, but it—from what\nyou said earlier, doesn’t sound like there’s a desire to kind of regain the pace of QT that we have\nat the moment after the, the debt ceiling is resolved. Is that the case?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah, so we, we looked at pausing, and we looked at, at slowing,\nand, really, people came together very strongly behind slowing, not pausing, for a variety of\nreasons. And so people really came to be, you know, pretty strongly in favor of, of this move. It\nslows down the path and probably lengthens it—you know, doubles it, effectively, by slowing it\nby half. That’s, that’s—people thought that’s, that’s a good place to be. It’ll, it’ll, you know,\nhelp us assure that this path is, is a smooth one as we get closer and closer to that. So that’s how\nthat came about.\nJEAN YUNG. Well, I guess my question is more, was that meant to be a temporary\nmeasure during the debt ceiling episode, or—?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, it was—it was actually—it was the, the TGA flows—\nTreasury General Account flows that got us thinking about this. But the more we thought about\nit, we came around to this. And, and, you know, it, it is—yes, it was provoked. The original\ndiscussion was provoked by that. But I think what we came up with, though, was broader than\nthat and different than it. It does address that issue, but it really is also—it fits in really nicely\nwith our principles and our plans, and the things we’ve done before, and the things we’ve said\nwe would do. So that’s why I—you know, pretty, pretty strong support. I’d just say it’s, it’s\nnothing to do with monetary policy, nothing to do with the size of the balance sheet. It’s just\nkind of a commonsense adjustment as you get closer and closer. Let’s slow down a little bit\nPage 27 of 28\nMarch 19, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nagain. And, that way, we’ll be more and more confident that we’re getting where we need to get.\nYou can take your time getting there. You know, we’re shrinking the balance sheet every\nmonth, and we think that’s—we think it was a good play and, as I mentioned, well supported.\nThanks very much.\nPage 28 of 28"

    "press_conf": "May 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nTranscript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference\nMay 7, 2025\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on\nachieving our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of\nthe American people. Despite heightened uncertainty, the economy is still in a solid position.\nThe unemployment rate remains low, and the labor market is at or near maximum employment.\nInflation has come down a great deal but has been running somewhat above our 2 percent longer-\nrun objective.\nIn support of our goals, today the Federal Open Market Committee decided to leave our\npolicy interest rate unchanged. The risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation appear to\nhave risen, and we believe that the current stance of monetary policy leaves us well positioned to\nrespond in a timely way to potential economic developments. I will have more to say about\nmonetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. [Cough] Pardon me.\nFollowing growth of 2.5 percent last year, GDP was reported to have edged down in the\nfirst quarter, reflecting swings in net exports that were likely driven by businesses bringing in\nimports ahead of potential tariffs. This unusual swing complicated GDP measurement last\nquarter. Private domestic final purchases, or PDFP—which excludes net exports, inventory\ninvestment, and government spending—grew at a solid 3 percent rate in the first quarter, the\nsame as last year’s pace. Within PDFP, growth of consumer spending moderated while\ninvestment in equipment and intangibles rebounded from weakness in the fourth quarter.\nSurveys of households and businesses, however, report a sharp decline in sentiment and elevated\nuncertainty about the economic outlook, largely reflecting trade policy concerns. It remains to\nbe seen how these developments might affect future spending and investment.\nPage 1 of 25\nMay 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nIn the labor market, conditions have remained solid. Payroll job gains averaged\n155,000 per month over the past three months. The unemployment rate, at 4.2 percent, remains\nlow and has stayed in a narrow range for the past year. Wage growth has continued to moderate,\nwhile still outpacing inflation. Overall, a wide set of indicators suggests that conditions in the\nlabor market are broadly in balance and consistent with maximum employment. The labor\nmarket is not a source of significant inflationary pressures.\nInflation has eased significantly from its highs in mid-2022 but remains somewhat\nelevated relative to our 2 percent longer-run goal. Total PCE prices rose 2.3 percent over the\n12 months ending in March; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices\nrose 2.6 percent. Near-term measures of inflation expectations have moved up, as reflected in\nboth market- and survey-based measures. Survey respondents, including consumers, businesses,\nand professional forecasters, point to tariffs as the driving factor. Beyond the next year or so,\nhowever, most measures of longer-term expectations remain consistent with our 2 percent\ninflation goal.\nOur monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people. At today’s meeting, the Committee\ndecided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4¼ to 4½ percent and to\ncontinue reducing the size of the balance sheet.\nThe new Administration is in the process of implementing substantial policy changes in\nfour distinct areas: trade, immigration, fiscal policy, and regulation. The tariff increases\nannounced so far have been significantly larger than anticipated. All of these policies are still\nevolving, however, and their effects on the economy remain highly uncertain. As economic\nconditions evolve, we’ll continue to determine the appropriate stance of monetary policy based\non the incoming data, the outlook, and the balance of risks.\nPage 2 of 25\nMay 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nIf the large increases in tariffs that have been announced are sustained, they are likely to\ngenerate a rise in inflation, a slowdown in economic growth, and an increase in unemployment.\nThe effects on inflation could be short lived, reflecting a one-time shift in the price level. It is\nalso possible that the inflationary effects could instead be more persistent. Avoiding that\noutcome will depend on the size of the tariffs’ effect—tariff effects, on how long it takes for\nthem to pass through fully into prices, and, ultimately, on keeping longer-term inflation\nexpectations well anchored.\nOur obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored and to prevent\na one-time increase in the price level from becoming an ongoing inflation problem. As we act to\nmeet that obligation, we’ll balance our maximum-employment and price-stability mandates,\nkeeping in mind that, without price stability, we cannot achieve the long periods of strong labor\nmarket conditions that benefit all Americans.\nWe may find ourselves in the challenging scenario in which our dual-mandate goals are\nin tension. If that were to occur, we would consider how far the economy is from each goal, and\nthe potentially different time horizons over which those respective gaps would be anticipated to\nclose. For the time being, we’re well positioned to wait for greater clarity before considering any\nadjustments to our policy stance.\nAt this meeting, the Committee continued its discussions as part of our five-year review\nof our monetary policy framework. We focused on inflation dynamics and the implications for\nour monetary policy strategy. Our review includes outreach and public events involving a wide\nrange of parties, including Fed Listens events around the country and a research conference next\nweek. Throughout this process, we’re open to new ideas and critical feedback, and we will take\non board lessons of the last five years in determining our findings. We intend to wrap up the\nreview by late summer.\nPage 3 of 25\nMay 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nThe Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy—maximum employment and\nstable prices. We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation\nsustainably to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.\nOur success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans. We understand that our\nactions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in\nservice to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our\nmaximum-employment and price-stability goals.\nThank you. I look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Thank you, Mr. Chair, for taking my\nquestion. A lot has happened since the last meeting. There have been tariffs put on, tariffs taken\noff, and meanwhile, there was a bill advancing in Congress. And I just wonder if I could press\nyou on the last part of your statement. Are you any closer now to deciding which side of the\nmandate is going to need urgent care first?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, so, as we noted in our—in our statement—postmeeting\nstatement, we’ve judged that the risks to higher employment and higher inflation have both risen.\nAnd this, by the way, of course, is compared to March. So that’s what we can say. I don’t think\nwe can say, you know, which way this will shake out. I think there’s a great deal of uncertainty\nabout, for example, where tariff policies are going to, to settle out and also, when they do settle\nout, what will be the implications for the economy for growth and for employment. I think it’s\ntoo early to know that. So, I mean, ultimately, we think our policy rate is in—is in a good place\nto stay as we await further clarity on tariffs and, ultimately, their implications for the economy.\nPage 4 of 25\nMay 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Hearing you describe what you’re looking for in terms of being able\nto make a decision, it sounded like that’s a long-term process before you sound like you’re going\nto be comfortable, or the Committee would be comfortable, to act on what the data’s telling you.\nCHAIR POWELL. I don’t think we know. You know, I think—look where we are\ntoday. We have an economy that, if you “look through,” you know, the sort of distortions in Q1\nGDP, you’ve still got an economy that looks like it’s growing at a solid pace. The labor market\nappears to be solid. Inflation is running just a bit above 2 percent. So it’s an economy that’s\nbeen resilient and is in good shape, and our policy is sort of modestly or moderately restrictive.\nIt’s 100 basis points less restrictive than it was last fall. And so we think that leaves us in a good\nplace to wait and see. We don’t think we need to be in a hurry. We think we can be patient.\nWe’re going to be watching the data. The data may move quickly or slowly, but we do think\nwe’re in a good position, where we are, to, to let things evolve and become clearer in terms of\nwhat should be the monetary policy response.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nick.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos for the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, there’s\nnaturally a lot of [inaudible] around 2021 in supply shocks. But there are some who argue that\nthe current situation has notable differences. Energy costs are down. Housing imbalances look\nnothing like they did four years ago. Labor demand appears to be gradually cooling, with wage\ngrowth running below 4 percent. What do you see right now that could nourish higher inflation\nbeyond a rise in goods prices this year?\nCHAIR POWELL. I think the underlying inflation picture is, is good. It’s what you see,\nwhich is inflation now running a bit above 2 percent. And we’ve had basically decent readings\nin housing services and nonhousing services, which is a big part of it. So that part, I think is, is\nmoving along well.\nPage 5 of 25\nMay 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nBut there’s just so much that we don’t know. I think—and we’re in a good position to\nwait and see, is the thing. We don’t have to be in a hurry. The economy is—has been resilient\nand is doing fairly well. Our policy is well positioned. The costs of waiting to see further are\nfairly low, we think. So that’s what we’re doing. And, you know, we’ll, we’ll see. The\nAdministration is entering into negotiations with many countries over tariffs. We’ll know more\nwith each week and month that goes by where—about where tariffs are going to land—you\nknow, land, and we’ll know what the effects will be when we start to see those things. So we\nthink we’ll be learning. I can’t tell you how long it will take. But, for now, it does seem like\nit’s, it’s, it’s a fairly clear decision for us to wait and see and watch.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. So when you say that you don’t need to be in a hurry, does that mean\nthat—could the outlook change in such a way that a change in your stance could be warranted as\nsoon as your next meeting?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, as I said, we’re—we are comfortable with our policy\nstance. We think the right—we’re in the right place to wait and see how things evolve. We\ndon’t feel like we need to be in a hurry. We feel like it’s appropriate to be patient. And, you\nknow, when things develop—of course, we have a record of—we can move quickly when that’s\nappropriate. But we think right now, the appropriate thing to do is to wait and see how things\nevolve. There’s so much uncertainty. If you talk to businesses or market participants or\nforecasters, everyone is just—is just waiting to see how developments play out, and then we’ll be\nable to make a better assessment of what the appropriate path for monetary policy is. So we’re\nnot in that place, and, you know, as that develops—and I can’t really give you a time frame\non that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jonnelle.\nPage 6 of 25\nMay 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nJONNELLE MARTE. Jonnelle Marte with Bloomberg. So, many economists have been\npricing in higher odds of a recession, and several are noting that it is more difficult for the Fed to\ncut rates preemptively, given the higher risks for higher inflation. So, given the outlook, do you\nstill see a path for a soft landing, and what does that look like?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, let me say—I mean, so let’s, let’s, let’s look back and see\nwhere we are. So, go through 2024 up to the [present] day. We’ve had—we’ve had, you know,\nunemployment in the low 4s for more than a year, we’ve had inflation coming down in the—now\nin the mid-to-low 2s, and we’ve had an economy growing at 2½ percent. So that is—that is the\neconomy as we see it now. What looks likely, given the scope and scale of the tariffs, is that we\nwill see the—certainly, the risks to higher inflation, higher unemployment have increased. And\nif that’s what we do see, if—and if the tariffs are ultimately put in place at those levels, which we\ndon’t know, then, then we will see—we won’t see further progress toward our goals, but we\nmight see a delay in that. I think in the—you know, in our thinking, we would get—we would\nnever—we never do anything but keep achieving those goals. But what we would—at least for\nthe next, let’s say, year, we would—we would not be making progress toward those goals, again,\nif that is—if that’s the way the tariffs shake out. The thing is, we don’t know that. There’s so\nmuch uncertainty about the scale, scope, timing, and persistence of the tariffs. So that’s that. In\nterms of preemption, you know, I think you can look back at the 2019 cuts as preemptive. I\nwouldn’t say that what we did last fall was at all preemptive. If anything, it was a little late. But\n2019, we did cut three times. But the situation was, you had a weakening economy, and you had\ninflation at 1.6 percent. So that’s a situation where you can move preemptively. Now we have\ninflation running above target. It has been above target for four years. It’s not so far above\ntarget now. And we have an expectation conditional on what happens that we’ll see upward\npressure on inflation. If you look at where forecasters are, they’re all forecasting an increase in\nPage 7 of 25\nMay 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ninflation. So it makes it—and then we’ve also got, you know, forecasts of weakening in the\neconomy, and some have recession forecasts. We don’t make a—we don’t make—publish a\nforecast about, about that. We don’t publish a forecast that assesses how likely a recession is.\nBut, in any case, it’s not a situation where we can be preemptive, because we actually don’t\nknow what the right response to, to the data will be until we see more data.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Colby.\nCOLBY SMITH. Colby Smith with the New York Times. How much weakness does the\nCommittee need to see, though, in the labor market and the economy more broadly to lower\ninterest rates again? Is it about a certain increase in the unemployment rate over a period of\ntime, or perhaps a certain number of negative monthly job reports? I mean, how are you making\nthat assessment?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, so first of all, we don’t see that yet, right? We have\n4.2 percent unemployment, good participation, wages behaving very well, participation, I\nmentioned, at a good level. So, you know, with the labor market, we would look at the totality of\nthe—of the data. We’d look at the level of the unemployment rate. We’d look at the speed with\nwhich it’s changing. We would look at the whole huge array of labor market data to, to get a\nsense of whether conditions are really deteriorating or not. And, at the same time, we’d be\nlooking at the other side of the mandate. We could be in a position of having to balance those\ntwo things, which is, of course, a very—a difficult balancing judgment that we’d have to make.\nCOLBY SMITH. On that point about balancing, I mean, you’ve mentioned that the\nCommittee would consider how far the economy is from each goal and the time it would take to\nkind of get back to that point. But what does that mean in practice? I mean, how much of that\nassessment will be rooted in a forecast, versus data dependence?\nPage 8 of 25\nMay 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. It would be a combination of the two. I mean, let’s just say this is\na—this would be a complicated and challenging judgment that we would have to make if—and\nthis is—we’re not in this situation, but the situation is if the two goals are in tension. So let’s say\nthat unemployment is moving up in an uncomfortable way and so is inflation—not the situation\nwe’re in—hypothetically. But we would look at how far they are from the goals, how far they’re\nexpected to be from the goals, what’s the expected time to get back to their goals. We’d look at\nall those things and make a difficult judgment. And that’s in our framework. It’s always been in\nour thinking. You know, it’s—we haven’t had—we haven’t faced that question in a very long\ntime. And so, again, difficult, difficult judgment to make, and not one that we face today. And\nwe may never face it. But, you know, we have to be keeping it in our thinking now.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Edward.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you. Edward Lawrence with Fox Business. So we had\nthe CPI report that came out that showed, month over month, the first increase in inflation in\nabout three years. The jobs report—you said “solid”—that we saw. At the same time, we have\nthose new tariffs that we’re living under. So, given this, should the Federal Reserve be cutting\nrates at all this year?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, it’s going to depend. I think you have to just take a step\nback and realize this is—this is why we are where we are, is, you know, we are going to need to\nsee how this evolves. There are cases in which it would be appropriate for us to cut rates this\nyear. There are cases in which it wouldn’t, and we just don’t know. Until we know more about\nhow this is going to settle out and what the economic implications are for employment, for—and\nfor, for inflation, I couldn’t confidently say that I know what the appropriate path will be.\nPage 9 of 25\nMay 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. So, following on that, just, you know—so then how does\nPresident Trump calling on you personally as well as the Federal Reserve to make rate cuts affect\nyour decision today and affect your job difficulty?\n[0:18:00]\nCHAIR POWELL. Doesn’t affect our—doing our job at all. So we—you know, we’re\nalways going to do the same thing—which is, we’re going to use our tools to foster maximum\nemployment and price stability for the benefit of the American people. We’re always going to\nconsider only the economic data, the outlook, the balance of risks. And that’s it, that’s all we’re\ngoing to consider. So it really doesn’t affect either our job or the way we do it.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Howard.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Hi. Howard Schneider with Reuters, and thanks for the time.\nI’m wondering—I mean, given the complexity about the first-quarter GDP and what lies ahead,\nI’m just wondering what your intuition tells you about the underlying direction of the economy\nright now. Many of your colleagues have said they feel growth is slowing. If so, do you have\nany sense of by how much, to what degree the slowdown may be? What does your gut tell you\nabout how things are evolving out there?\nCHAIR POWELL. My gut tells me that uncertainty about the path of the economy is\nextremely elevated [laughter] and that the downside risks have increased. The risk is—as we\npointed out in our statement, the risks—the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation\nhave risen, but they haven’t materialized yet. They really haven’t. They’re not, really not in the\ndata yet, so that—and that tells me more than by intuition because I think—I think it’s obvious,\nactually, that the right thing for us to do is to—we’re in a good place. Our policy’s in a very\ngood place, and the right thing to do is, is await further clarity. And I—you know, there’s—\nusually, things clarify, and that—the appropriate direction becomes clear. That’s what usually\nPage 10 of 25\nMay 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nhappens, right? Right now, it’s very hard to say what that would be. In the meantime, the\neconomy is doing fine. Our policy isn’t—you know, it’s not highly restrictive. It’s somewhat\nrestrictive. It’s 100 basis points less restrictive than it was in, you know, last summer. So we\nthink it’s—we think it’s in a good place, and we think the appropriate thing is for us to wait and\nsee and get more clarity about, about the direction of the economy.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Well, let me press you on this idea of the economy being fine\nright now, because, reading the Beige Book very closely the last time around, there was a lot of,\nyou know, negative stuff, negative sentiment that was in there. And I know that everybody’s\nlooking at soft data right now. You mentioned it yourself—that the sentiment’s sour. But the\nBeige Book was talking about, you know, the beginnings of layoffs in some industries, prices\nrising in, in some places, and an awful lot of investment decisions being, being pushed to the\nsideline. Doesn’t that point to a slowdown?\nCHAIR POWELL. It may well. It just hasn’t shown up yet. And, and, you know, we all\nlook at all these sentiments and read many, many individual comments just to get a better feel.\nAnd it—you know, businesses and households very broadly are concerned and, you know,\npostponing economic decisions of various kinds. And, yes, if that continues and nothing,\nnothing happens to sort of alleviate those concerns, then you would expect that to begin to show\nup in economic data. It wouldn’t maybe show up overnight, but it would show up over weeks\nand months. And that may be what happens, but it hasn’t happened yet. And also, there are\nthings that can happen that will—that will change that narrative. I mean, they haven’t happened,\nbut it’s possible to imagine things. But in the meantime, yes, we’re watching it extremely\ncarefully, like everyone is, but don’t see really much evidence of it in the actual economic data\nyet. And by the way, consumers keep spending, credit card spending. It’s—you know, it’s\nPage 11 of 25\nMay 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nstill—it’s still a healthy economy, albeit one that is shrouded in some very downbeat sentiment\non the part of people and businesses.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Michael McKee.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television. The\nFed’s been criticized recently by a former Governor for what he calls “mission creep”—you take\non more problems, use more tools, and then end up building tools to deal with the fallout of those\ntools, which then makes it a given that you will act more aggressively in the future. Is that a fair\ncritique, and is that something you would be looking at in your framework review?\nCHAIR POWELL. Sorry, say that critique again.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. That the Fed has been involved in mission creep—gets involved in\nusing too many new tools to deal with problems and to go too far. Is that something that—the\ncritique was based around the fact that you did QE and QE and QE and—\nCHAIR POWELL. Oh, okay. Sure.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. —and went beyond the narrow confines of your mandate.\nCHAIR POWELL. So—well, I mean, there are a couple—that’s not really beyond the\nconfines of our mandate. I—look, I would say this: We—you know, we did things—essentially,\nwe were on an emergency footing for a couple of years in the pandemic, and it’s very fair and\nvery welcome for people to look back over what we did and say, “Hey, you could have done this\nbetter and different.” And one thing we hear a lot is, we could have explained the QE a little\nbetter. We did think we were explaining it in real time. I completely accept the, the thought that\nwe could have explained it better. There’s a lot of thinking that we went on too long with QE. I\ncan tell you that the reason we did was, we were—we were concerned that we didn’t want a\ntightening of—a sharp tightening in financial conditions at a time when we thought the economy\nPage 12 of 25\nMay 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nwas still vulnerable. And so we did hold on for a long time to QE. And we, of course, tapered\nand everything. And then we immediately went into QT, and, you know, we’ve—we’re down a\ncouple of trillion. But I get the—that, you know, we, we certainly, with the benefit of hindsight,\ncould have tapered earlier or faster. That’s absolutely right. But this is all very welcome. You\nknow, it’s, it’s—you know, we knew, doing this in real time, that we weren’t going to get it\nperfect. And those kind of—those kind of, you know, after-action kind of looks are essential.\nAnd we’re doing the same thing in—you know, in our review, so—on some issues.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. There—the other part of that critique is that you’ve taken on topics\nthat are outside of the mandate, such as climate change and trying to ensure that certain groups\nare benefited by your economic policies in terms of employment, et cetera.\nCHAIR POWELL. So, okay, on climate, you’ve heard me say over and over again that\nwe will not be climate policymakers and that our role on climate is a very, very narrow one. And\nI think—I think that’s what we’ve done. We’ve done really very little on climate. You can say\nthat was—that little bit that we’ve done was too much. But I wouldn’t want to give any\nimpression that, that, you know, we take—that we’ve taken climate in and it’s something that\nwe’re spending a lot of time and energy on. We’re not. We have very, very narrow things. We\ndid one thing, one guidance for the banks, and then we did one—a one-time stress analysis,\nclimate stress analysis, and that’s it. And, you know, we dropped out of the Network for\nGreening the Financial System. So we didn’t do much on climate, but—and I do think, and I’ve\nsaid this publicly several times, I think it’s, it’s a real danger for us to try to take on a mandate\nlike that, which is very narrow application to our work. And, you know, the risk is, if you—if\nyou go for things that are really not on your mandate, you know, then why are you independent?\nYou know, I think that’s a very fair question. And I do think we’ve done a whole lot less on\nclimate than some people seem to think we did. Anyway, that’s what I think.\nPage 13 of 25\nMay 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Should you have taken on the question of bringing unemployment\nrates down for specific categories?\nCHAIR POWELL. We didn’t do that. You know, we said—what we said was that we\nnever targeted any unemployment rate for individual racial or demographic groups. What we\nsaid was that maximum employment was a broad and inclusive goal. And I think what we meant\nby that was, we’re going to consider the totality of the country as we look at our maximum-\nemployment goal. Of course, we were never going to target on any individual group with that,\nbut I think some people, you know, wanted to hear it that way. But that’s not at all what we\nmeant. But—so that’s just not a correct reading of our—but I can see how, you know, maybe\npeople found that confusing, and, you know, we have to take that into consideration.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jo Ling.\nJO LING KENT. Hi, Chair Powell. Thanks for taking our questions today. I’m Jo Ling\nKent with CBS News. You’ve said, “Wait and see” and “The economy is doing fine” today.\nBut the impact of tariffs are already showing up at the ports. Businesses big and small are telling\nus that they feel it, and most importantly, consumers say they feel it. But the challenges are here.\nAnd there’s no waiting and seeing. For Main Street, what is the breaking point? What would\nhave to happen to prompt a rate cut specifically?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, you know, so we really don’t see in the data yet big economic\neffects. We see—we see sentiment, their concerns that higher prices may be coming, or things\nlike that, but—so people, they’re worried now about inflation. They’re worried about, you\nknow, a shock from the tariffs. But they really haven’t—that shock hasn’t hit yet. Okay, so, you\nknow, we’re going to be looking at not just the sentiment data, but also the real economic data as\nwe assess what it is we should do. And remember, we’re—there will be two effects. One of\nthem would be weakening economy—weakening economic activity, which translates into higher\nPage 14 of 25\nMay 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nunemployment, and the other would be potentially higher inflation. Again, to say it again, the\ntiming, the scope, the scale, and the persistence of those effects are very, very uncertain. So it’s\nnot at all clear what the appropriate response for monetary policy is at this time. And we’re—\nyou know—and by the way, our policy’s in a good place, so we think we can wait and move\nwhen it is clear what the right thing to do is; really not at all clear what it is we should do. So\npeople are feeling stress and concern, but unemployment hasn’t gone up. Job creation is fine.\nWages are in good shape. You know, people are not—layoffs are—people are not getting laid\noff at high levels. You know, initial claims for unemployment are not increasing, you know, in\nany kind of impressive way. So the economy itself is still, you know, in solid shape.\nJO LING KENT. Just a quick follow-up: President Trump now says he does not plan to\nremove you as Chair. When you heard that, what did you think?\nCHAIR POWELL. I don’t have anything more for you on that. I’ve pretty much\ncovered that issue. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Chris.\nCHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Hi. Thank you. Chris Rugaber, Associated Press. Well, I\njust wanted to follow up. Earlier, it sounded like you said it was unclear how the Fed—you\nknow, what kind of interest rate decisions you will make later this year. So does that—you\nknow, in March, there was guidance that two cuts might happen, you know, two cuts were\npenciled in for this year. Is that now—that guidance from the last press conference, has that\nbeen overtaken by events at this point?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, we don’t do a Summary of Economic Projections at\nevery meeting, as you know. We do it every other meeting. And so this was the meeting when\nwe didn’t do it. And I—you know, we don’t also kind of poll people, so I really—I really\nwouldn’t want to try to make a specific projection for where we are relative to that. We will—in\nPage 15 of 25\nMay 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nsix weeks, we have the June meeting, and you’ll have another SEP. I’m not going to hazard a\nguess here today what—as to what it would be. Again, what I would say is that we think our\npolicy rate is in a good place. We think it leaves us well positioned to respond in a timely way to\npotential developments. That’s where we are, and that—depending on the way things play out,\nthat could include rate hikes—sorry, rate cuts. You know, it could include us holding where we\nare. We just are going to need to see, you know, how things play out before we make those\ndecisions.\nCHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Great. And just to follow up on that, I mean, when you\naddress the issue of how the Fed would handle both rising unemployment and rising inflation,\nhow are you thinking about the fact that addressing one could exacerbate the other? So a rate cut\nto reduce unemployment could worsen inflation, and vice versa. How does that—how do you\nhandle those challenges?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, you just captured the—this is the issue with the two goals\nbeing in tension. It’s a very challenging question. Now, there can be a case in which one goal is\nvery far—one variable’s very far from its goal, much farther than the other. And if so, you\nconcentrate on that one. And, frankly, that was the case—well, it wasn’t a case where they were\nreally in tension. But if you go back to 2022, it was very clear that we needed to focus on\ninflation. The labor market was also super tight, so it wasn’t really a tradeoff. You know, if—I\nthink you know what our—what our framework document says. It says we’ll look at how far\neach goal—each variable is from its goal and also we’ll factor in the time it would take to get\nthere. So, you know, that’s going to be a—potentially, a very difficult judgment. But the data\ncould break in a way that it’s not. You know, I just don’t think we know that. The data could\neasily favor one or the other. And right now, there’s no way to—no need to make a choice and\nno real basis for doing so.\nPage 16 of 25\nMay 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMICHELLE SMITH. Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi. Victoria Guida with Politico. I wanted to ask, Congress is\ncurrently debating spending cuts alongside expending—extending the tax cuts. And I know\nyou’ve talked many times about how the path of the debt is unsustainable. But given that we’re\nalso talking right now about the economy slowing, potentially even recession, I was just\nwondering, is there a danger that spending cuts now could slow growth a lot more?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, we don’t give Congress fiscal advice. I—they’re going\nto do—we take what they do as a given, and we put it in our models and in our assessment of the\neconomy, so I wouldn’t want to, you know, speculate on that. I mean, I think we do know that\nthe debt is on an unsustainable level—on an unsustainable path—not on an unsustainable level,\nbut an unsustainable path. And it’s on Congress to figure out how to get us back on a sustainable\npath, and, you know, it’s not up to us to give them advice.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Well, do you think that they should take macroeconomic\nconditions into account as they look at this?\nCHAIR POWELL. I think they don’t need my advice and our advice on how to do fiscal\npolicy any more than we need their advice on monetary policy. [Laughter]\nMICHELLE SMITH. Andrew.\nANDREW ACKERMAN. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Andrew Ackerman with the\nWashington Post. In your Jackson Hole comments last year, you said you would not welcome\nfurther cooling in labor market conditions. The unemployment rate then was 4.2 percent, which\nis what it is now. Forecasters—many forecasters now predict a higher jobless rate. How has\nyour tolerance for weakening labor market conditions changed compared to a year ago?\nCHAIR POWELL. So it was quite a different situation. What was happening last year is\nthat over the space of six, eight, seven months, the unemployment rate went up by almost a full\nPage 17 of 25\nMay 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\npercentage point, and it was click, click, click, click, click each month. And, you know,\neverywhere, people were talking about downside risks to the labor market. At the same time,\npayroll job numbers were getting softer and softer. So there was a really obvious concern about\ndownside risk to the labor market. And so at Jackson Hole and then in September, you know, we\nwanted to address that forthrightly. We wanted to show that we were there for the—I mean, we\nhad been there for inflation for a couple of years, and we wanted to show also that we’re there\nfor the labor market. And it was important that we send that signal. Fortunately, since then, the\nlabor market has really—and the unemployment rate have really been moving sideways at a level\nthat is, you know, well in the range of mainstream estimates of maximum employment. So that\nconcern has gotten a lot less. So, you know, you’re at 4.2 percent unemployment. I think we\nwere in a very different situation. And now we have a situation where, you know, the risks to\nhigher inflation and higher unemployment have both gone up, as we noted in our statement, and\nwe’ve got to monitor both of those. We actually have a potential situation where there may be a\ntradeoff or tension between the two potentially. We don’t have it yet, and we may not have it,\nbut that’s what we [may] have, and that’s why I think it’s a very different, different situation.\nANDREW ACKERMAN. I, I mean, I guess I want to follow up by asking how much of\na rise in the jobless rate you would—you could tolerate.\nCHAIR POWELL. I can’t give you a—you know, a—I’m not going to try to give you a\nspecific number. I’ll just say, we’ve got—we have to now be looking at both variables and\nwhich of them is, is, you know, demanding—if one of them is demanding our focus more than\nthe other, that would tell us what to do with policy. If they’re more or less this, you know,\nequally distant and equally—or not distant, then we don’t have to make that assessment. You\nknow, the assessment is, you wait. So I’m not going to try to be really specific about what we\nneed to see in terms of the number. But if—look, if we did see, you know, significant\nPage 18 of 25\nMay 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ndeterioration in the labor market, of course that’s one of our two variables, and we would look to\nbe able to support that. You’d hope that it wasn’t also coming at a time when inflation was\ngetting very bad. And, again, we’re speculating here. We don’t know this. We don’t know any\nof these things. It’s very hypothetical. We’re just going to have to wait and see how the—how it\nplays out.\nANDREW ACKERMAN. Thanks.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Claire.\nCLAIRE JONES. Claire Jones, Financial Times. In terms of getting some clarity, we’ve\ngot some talks at the weekend in Geneva between the U.S. and China. A lot of economists are\nask—are attaching an awful lot of importance to how—what we hear from those talks. How\nmuch importance are you attaching to them in terms of judging what will happen to the U.S.\neconomy going forward? And just in a similar vein, you know, some economists are saying it’s\ndays, not weeks, that we have until we start to put the U.S. economy at risk of seeing a sort of\npandemic here, with shortages and higher prices, if we don’t kind of soothe relations between the\nU.S. and China. So it would be good to have your view on that, too.\nCHAIR POWELL. So, you know, these are not talks that we’re in any way involved in,\nso I really can’t comment directly on them. So—but what I will say is this: You know, we\nhad—coming out of the March meeting, we, we—the public generally had an assessment of\nwhere tariffs were going. And then April 2 happened, and it was really substantially larger than\nanticipated in the forecasts that I’ve seen and in our forecast. So—and now we—and now we\nhave a different—we’re in a new phase where—it seems to be we’re entering a new phase where\nthe Administration is entering into beginning talks with a number of our important trading\npartners. And that’s—that has the potential to change the picture materially or not. And so I\nthink it’s going to be very important how that shakes out. But I—you know, we simply have to\nPage 19 of 25\nMay 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nwait and see how it works out. It certainly could change the picture, and we’re mindful of not\ntrying to make conclusive judgments about what will happen at a time when the—you know,\nwhen the facts are changing.\nCLAIRE JONES. And just on the fall in shipping volumes from China over these\ntensions, I mean, do you share that concern that we could start seeing goods shortages and higher\nprices in the coming weeks if this isn’t resolved very quickly?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, I don’t want to get my—we’re not—we shouldn’t be\ninvolved, even verbally, in questions about the timing of these things. Yes, we’re—of course,\nwe follow all that data. We see the shipping data. We see all that. But, ultimately, this is for the\nAdministration to do. This is—you know, this is their mandate, not ours. And I know they’re—\nas you can see, they’re, again, having—beginning to have talks with many nations. And that has\nthe potential to change the picture materially, so we’ll just have to wait and see.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Kosuke.\nKOSUKE TAKAMI. Kosuke Takami with Nikkei. Thank you for doing this. The\nvolume of imported goods increased significantly in the first quarter. Do you think the decision\ncould cause a delay in the impact of tariff on inflation, and does this mean that it will take a\nlonger time to reduce uncertainty?\nCHAIR POWELL. The decision we made today? Which decision?\nKOSUKE TAKAMI. So the future decisions. So the volume of imports—\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes.\nKOSUKE TAKAMI. —imported goods has increased significantly. So the impact of the\nimported inflation may delay. So, what is the impact to your future decision?\nCHAIR POWELL. Okay, so, I mean, I think we—I think we think that the—you know,\nthere was a big spike in imports—right?—very big, historically large, really, and—to beat tariffs.\nPage 20 of 25\nMay 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nAnd now that should actually reverse so that it’s—you know, it’s the difference between—it’s\nexports minus imports, so—and imports were huge, and so then it conveyed a very negative\ncontribution to U.S. GDP—annualized GDP in the first quarter, as we all know. So that could, in\nthe second quarter, be reversed so that we have, you know, an unusually large contribution to—\nunusually positive. That’s very likely as imports drop sharply. You could also have—you know,\nvery likely you’ll have restatements of the—of the first quarter. It’ll turn out that consumer\nspending was higher. It will turn out that inventories were higher. And so you’ll see—you’ll see\nthose data revised up. It may actually go into the third quarter, too. And so I think it’s going—\nthis whole process is going to, a little bit, make it harder to make a clean assessment of U.S.\ndemand. I mentioned private domestic final purchases, which doesn’t have inventories,\ngovernment, or—inventories, government. Anyway, it’s a cleaner read on private demand. But\nthat, that, too, probably was flattered a little bit by—you know, by strong demand for imports to\nbe tariffed. So that might overstate. It’s a really good reading, 3 percent PDFP in the first\nquarter. That might actually overstate. So it’s not really going to—I don’t think it’s going to\naffect our decisions. I will just say, though, that it’s a little confusing and it’s probably less\nconfusing to us than it would be to the general public as we try to explain this. You know, it’s\ncomplicated, and, you know, GDP is sending a signal. PDFP is sending a signal. It’s a little bit\nconfusing. But I think we understand what’s going, and it’s not really going to change things\nfor us.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Courtenay.\nCOURTENAY BROWN. Thank you. Courtenay Brown from Axios. I guess, you\nknow, we talked about some of the indications of potential layoffs, price hikes, an economic\nslowdown all being evident in the soft data. I’m curious why the Fed needs to wait for that to\ntranslate into hard data to, you know, make any type of monetary policy decision, especially if\nPage 21 of 25\nMay 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthe hard data is not as timely or might be warped by tariff-related effects. Are you worried that\nthe soft data might be some sort of false warning?\nCHAIR POWELL. No. I mean, it’s—look, the—look at the state of the economies. The\nlabor market is solid. Inflation is low. We can afford to be patient as things unfold. There’s no\nreal cost to our waiting at this point. Also, the sense of it—the sense of it is, we’re not sure what\nthe right thing will be. You know, there should be some increase in inflation. There should be\nsome increase in unemployment. Those call for different responses. And so until we know—\npotentially call for different responses—and so, you know, until we know more, we have the\nability to wait and see. And it seems to be a pretty clear decision. Everyone on the Committee\nsupported waiting. And so that’s why we’re waiting.\nCOURTENAY BROWN. Just a very quick follow-up: There was this sort of vibe\nsession, if you will, where the sentiments expressed in soft data did not translate into the hard\neconomic data. Are you—how are you thinking about that when interpreting some of the signs\nin the softer survey data?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, I think, going back a number of years, the link between\nsentiment data and consumer spending has been weak. It’s not been a strong link at all. On the\nother hand, we haven’t had a move of this, you know, speed and size. So it wouldn’t be the case\nthat we’re looking at this and just completely dismissing it. But it’s another reason to wait and\nsee. You’re right that we had a couple of years during the pandemic where people were\nsaying—just very downbeat surveys and going out and spending money. So that can happen,\nand that may happen to some degree here. We just don’t know. This is an outsized change in\nsentiment, though, and so none of us are looking at this and saying that we’re sure one way or\nthe other. We’re not.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Matt.\nPage 22 of 25\nMay 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMATT EGAN. Thanks, Chair Powell. Matt Egan with CNN. So you mentioned earlier\nthat you’re monitoring the shipping data. And we have seen in the shipping data that imports\nfrom China into the Port of Los Angeles have plunged. And that has raised concerns about\npotential shortages. What tools, if any, does the Fed have to ensure that prices and inflation\nexpectations don’t get out of hand if tariffs do cause significant supply chain disruptions?\nCHAIR POWELL. I mean, we don’t have, you know, the kind of tools that are good at\ndealing with supply chain problems. We don’t have that at all. That’s a—that’s a job for the\nAdministration and for the private sector more than anything. You know, what we can do with\nour interest rate tool is, we can support—be more or less supportive of demand. And that’s—\nthat’d be a very inefficient way to try to fix supply chain problems. But, you know, we don’t\nsee—we don’t see the inflation yet. We’re, of course, reading the same stories and watching the\nsame data as everybody else. And, you know, right now, we see inflation, you know, kind of\nmoving sideways at a fairly low level.\nMATT EGAN. If I could follow up on that, President Trump has indicated that he will\nlikely name a replacement for you when your term as Chair expires next year. But your position\non the Board runs through January 2028, I believe. Would you consider remaining on the Fed\nBoard even if you’re no longer Chair?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I don’t have anything for you on that. My whole focus is on—\nand my colleagues’ focus is all on, you know, trying to navigate this tricky passage we’re in right\nnow, trying to make the right decisions. You know, we want to make the best decisions for the\npeople that we serve. That’s what we think about day and night. And this is a challenging\nsituation, and that’s, that’s 100 percent of our focus right now.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Let’s go to Jennifer for the last question.\nPage 23 of 25\nMay 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. Thank you so much, Chair Powell. Jennifer Schonberger\nwith Yahoo Finance. Public records of your schedule so far this year show no meetings with\nPresident Trump. Past Presidents Obama, Bush, and Clinton have all met with Fed Chairs. And\nyou met with Trump during his first term. Why haven’t you asked for a meeting yet with the\nPresident?\nCHAIR POWELL. I’ve never asked for a meeting with any President, and I never will.\nIt’s not—I wouldn’t do that. There’s never a reason for me to ask for a meeting. It’s always\nbeen the other way.\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. So would you want to meet with him if given the\nopportunity—\nCHAIR POWELL. I never—\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. —to get more information?\nCHAIR POWELL. I never—it’s never an initiative that I take. It’s always an\ninitiative—I—you know, I don’t think it’s up to a Fed Chair to seek a meeting with the\nPresident, although maybe some have done so. I’ve never done so, and I can’t imagine myself\ndoing that. It’s—I think it’s always—comes the other way: A President wants to meet with you.\nBut that hasn’t happened.\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. And if I could just ask one question on monetary policy,\nwhen it is time to cut rates, how will you determine how far down rates will have to come to try\nto keep a balance on the inflation mandate as employment weakens?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, I think once you have a direction—a clear direction, you\ncan make a—we can make a judgment about how fast to move and that kind of thing. So it’s—\nreally, the harder question is the timing, I think, and when will that become clear? And,\nfortunately, as I mentioned, we have our policy in a good place, the economy’s in a good place,\nPage 24 of 25\nMay 7, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nand it’s really appropriate, we think, for us to be patient and wait for things to unfold as we get\nmore clarity about what we should do.\nThanks very much.\nPage 25 of 25"

    "press_conf": "June 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nTranscript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference\nJune 18, 2025\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on\nachieving our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of\nthe American people. Despite elevated uncertainty, the economy is in a solid position. The\nunemployment rate remains low, and the labor market is at or near maximum employment.\nInflation has come down a great deal but has been running somewhat above our 2 percent longer-\nrun objective.\nIn support of our goals, today the Federal Open Market Committee decided to leave our\npolicy interest rate unchanged. We believe that the current stance of monetary policy leaves us\nwell positioned to respond in a timely way to potential economic developments. I’ll have more\nto say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.\nFollowing growth of 2.5 percent last year, GDP was reported to have edged down in the\nfirst quarter, reflecting swings in net exports that were driven by businesses bringing in imports\nahead of potential tariffs. This unusual swing has complicated GDP measurement. Private\ndomestic final purchases, or PDFP, as we call them—which excludes net exports, inventory\ninvestment, and government spending—grew at a solid 2.5 percent rate. Within PDFP, growth\nof consumer spending moderated, while investment in equipment and intangibles rebounded\nfrom weakness in the fourth quarter. Surveys of households and businesses, however, report a\ndecline in sentiment over recent months and elevated uncertainty about the economic outlook,\nlargely reflecting trade policy concerns. It remains to be seen how these developments might\naffect future spending and investment. In our Summary of Economic Projections, the median\nparticipant projects GDP to rise 1.4 percent this year and 1.6 percent next year—somewhat\nslower than projected in March.\nPage 1 of 28\nJune 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nIn the labor market, conditions have remained solid. Payroll job gains averaged\n135,000 per month over the past three months. The unemployment rate, at 4.2 percent, remains\nlow and has stayed in a narrow range for the past year. Wage growth has continued to moderate\nwhile still outpacing inflation. Overall, a wide set of indicators suggests that conditions in the\nlabor market are broadly in balance and consistent with maximum employment. The labor\nmarket is not a source of significant inflationary pressures. The median projection for the\nunemployment rate in the SEP is 4.5 percent at the end of this year and next, a bit higher than\nprojected in March.\nInflation has eased significantly from its highs in mid-2022 but remains somewhat\nelevated relative to our 2 percent longer-run goal. Estimates based on the consumer price index\nand other data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.3 percent over the 12 months ending in May\nand that—excluding the volatile food and energy categories—core PCE prices rose\n2.6 percent. Near-term measures of inflation expectations have moved up over recent months, as\nreflected in both market- and survey-based measures. Respondents to surveys of consumers,\nbusinesses, and professional forecasters point to tariffs as the driving factor. Beyond the next\nyear or so, however, most measures of longer-term expectations remain consistent with our\n2 percent inflation goal. The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation this year is—is\n3 percent, somewhat higher than projected in March. The median inflation projection falls to\n2.4 percent in 2026 and 2.1 percent in 2027.\nOur monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people. At today’s meeting, the Committee\ndecided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4¼ to 4½ percent and to\ncontinue reducing the size of our balance sheet. We will continue to determine the appropriate\nPage 2 of 28\nJune 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nstance of monetary policy based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of\nrisks.\nChanges to trade, immigration, fiscal, and regulatory policies continue to evolve, and\ntheir effects on the economy remain uncertain. The effects of tariffs will depend, among other\nthings, on their ultimate level. Expectations of that level, and thus of the related economic\neffects, reached a peak in April and have since declined. Even so, increases in tariffs this year\nare likely to push up prices and weigh on economic activity.\nThe effects on inflation could be short lived—reflecting a one-time shift in the price\nlevel. It’s also possible that the inflationary effects could instead be more persistent. Avoiding\nthat outcome will depend on the size of the tariff effects, on how long it takes for them to pass\nthrough fully into prices, and, ultimately, on keeping longer-term inflation expectations well\nanchored.\nOur obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored and to prevent\na one-time increase in the price level from becoming an ongoing inflation problem. As we act to\nmeet that obligation, we will balance our maximum-employment and price-stability mandates,\nkeeping in mind that, without price stability, we cannot achieve the long periods of strong labor\nmarket conditions that benefit all Americans.\nWe may find ourselves in the challenging scenario in which our dual-mandate goals are\nin tension. If that were to occur, we would consider how far the economy is from each goal and\nthe potentially different time horizons over which those respective gaps would be anticipated to\nclose. For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of\nthe economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance.\nPage 3 of 28\nJune 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nIn our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an\nappropriate path for the federal funds rate, based on what each participant judges to be the most\nlikely scenario going forward. The median projection projects—participant—median participant\nprojects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 3.9 percent at the end of this\nyear, the same as projected in March. The median projection declines to 3.6 percent at the end of\nnext year and to 3.4 percent at the end of 2027, a little higher than the March projection. These\nindividual forecasts are always subject to uncertainty, and, as I have noted, uncertainty is\nunusually elevated. And, of course, these projections are not a Committee plan or decision.\nAt this meeting, the Committee continued its discussions as part of our five-year review\nof our monetary policy framework. We focused on issues related to assessing the risks and\nuncertainties that are relevant for monetary policy and the potential implications for policy\nstrategy and communications. Our review includes outreach and public events involving a wide\nrange of parties, including Fed Listens events around the country and a research conference that\nwe held last month. We are open to new ideas and critical feedback, and we will take on board\nlessons of the last five years in determining our findings. We intend to wrap up any\nmodifications to our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy by late\nsummer. After that, we will consider enhancements to our suite of communications tools,\nincluding the SEP.\nThe Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy: maximum employment and\nstable prices. We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation\nsustainably to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.\nOur success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans. We understand that our\nactions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in\nPage 4 of 28\nJune 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nservice to our public mission. And we at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our\nmaximum-employment and price-stability goals.\nThank you. I look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Colby.\nCOLBY SMITH. Thank you. Colby Smith with the New York Times. To what extent\nhas the more limited impact from tariffs at this stage on inflation changed your view on what the\nultimate economic fallout will be from these policies and the timing of when they will\nmaterialize in the data?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we’ve had three months of, of favorable inflation readings since\nthe high readings of January and February, and that’s, of course, highly welcome news. Part of\nthat just is that services, core services—both housing services and nonhousing services have\nreally been grinding down toward levels that are—that are consistent with 2 percent inflation. So\nthat’s the good news. We’ve had goods inflation just moving up a bit, and, of course, we\nexpect—as you—as you point out, we, we do expect to see more of that over the course of the\nsummer. It takes some time for tariffs to work their way through the chain of distribution to the\nend consumer.\nA good example of that would be, goods being sold at retailers today may have been\nimported several months ago—before tariffs were imposed—so we’re beginning to see some\neffects. And we do expect to see more of them over coming months. We do—we do also see\nprice increases in some of the relevant categories like personal computers and audio-visual\nequipment—things like that that are attributable to tariff increases. In addition, we look at\nsurveys of businesses, and there, there are many of those. And, and, you, you do see a range of\nthings, but, but many, many companies do expect to—to, to put all or—some or all of the effect\nPage 5 of 28\nJune 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nof tariffs through to the next, next person in the—in the chain and, ultimately, to the consumer.\nToday—you know, the amount of these—the, the amount of the tariff effects, the size of the\ntariff effects, their duration, and the time it will take are all highly uncertain. So that, that is why\nwe think the appropriate thing to do is to hold where we are as we learn more, and we think our\npolicy stance is, is in a good place—where we’re well positioned to react to incoming\ndevelopments.\nCOLBY SMITH. So in terms of how we should interpret the rate cuts penciled into the\nSEP, is this reflecting that there’s this expectation that underlying inflation will just stay well\nenough contained that allows the Committee to eventually move ahead with those cuts? Or is it\nabout, you know, responding to a deterioration in economic activity, let’s say? I mean, how\nshould we make sense of the forecast?\nCHAIR POWELL. So if you look at the forecast, you will see that people do generally\nexpect inflation to move up and then to come back down. But we can’t just assume that. Of\ncourse, we don’t know that, and, you know, our, our job is to make sure—one of our jobs—to\nmake sure that a one-time increase in inflation doesn’t turn into an inflation problem. And that,\nagain—that will depend on the size of the effects, how long it takes for them to come in, and,\nand, ultimately, on, on keeping inflation expectations anchored.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Howard.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Hi, and thanks, Chair Powell. Howard Schneider with\nReuters. If you look at the, the rate path starting in December to today and adjust it over the full\ntime horizon you’ve got there, you’ve taken about ¼ point per year out of your projected path.\nAnd you end at a higher rate in end-2027 than you were—would have in the prior forecast. Is\nthat a result of, of a sense that tariffs will lead to more persistent inflation? Is it a result of\nPage 6 of 28\nJune 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nreassessments of where your short-term neutral rate is? Is it—why, why are you on a slower\npath now?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I would focus most on the—on the nearer term. As you think—as\nyou get out to the—to the later years, it’s hard to—it’s hard for anybody to know where the\neconomy is going. You didn’t see people moving their longer-term, you know, estimate of the\nneutral rate, for example, at this meeting. So—and those things are probably slow moving. So I\nthink—I think if you look at what’s happening here since March—this is since March, right?—\nyou see a little slower growth, just a tiny tick up, one-tenth tick up, in, in unemployment, and\nyou see inflation moving up three-tenths. And by the way, it was—it was a similar move from\nthe December SEP to the March. So that’s what you see. You see the, the effects of tariffs. I\nthink we learned in April, after the March meeting, that substantially higher tariffs were likely,\nand then since then, the estimates of where the tariffs will be have actually moved back down,\nalthough still at an elevated level. So we’re adapting in real time, and what you see is, you\nknow, an, an accumulation of individual assessments.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Okay, but you say in the statement that risks have diminished\non that front, but the July 9, you know, drop-dead date for all the, the Liberation Day tariffs is\nstill out there and unresolved. You’ve got now an exchange of missiles between two Middle\nEast adversaries, with a possible U.S. involvement—how can you justify saying that risks have\ndiminished?\nCHAIR POWELL. So what we said was that uncertainty has, has—uncertainty about the\neconomic outlook has diminished but remains elevated. Many, many surveys say that. They do.\nSo—and, and, that’s—that’s actually a line from the Tealbook, which you can see in five years.\nRemember to check that. [Laughter]\nPage 7 of 28\nJune 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Maybe the world will be over by then. [Laughter]\nCHAIR POWELL. No—but if you think of that, tariff uncertainty—uncertainty really\npeaked in April and since then has come down. And that’s—that’s really what that’s just\nacknowledging. It’s diminished but still elevated—that it’s uncertainty. So I think that’s an\naccurate statement.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Chris Rugaber.\nCHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Thank you. Chris Rugaber at Associated Press. There is\nan argument out there in favor of cutting rates more immediately. Inflation has continued to cool\nand is back at roughly 2 percent, despite the tariffs. And I guess I also wanted to ask about, you\nknow, cracks in the job market, with gross hiring slowing—concentrated in just a few industries.\nWe’ve seen some housing data, including this morning, that have been pretty weak. Do you see\nany concerns that, you know, the economy is weakening and that is a reason to cut rates going\nforward?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we do—we do, of course, monitor all those things. I, I think if\nyou look at the overall picture, you know, what you’re seeing is 4.2 percent unemployment and\nan economy that’s growing at a—at a rate hard to know, given the, the unusual flows in the first\nquarter. But it appears to be 1½, 2 percent—maybe a little better than that. Sentiment has come\nup off of its very low levels. It’s still—it’s still depressed. So, you know, you can—you can\npoint to things—the housing market is a longer-run problem and also a short-run problem. I\ndon’t think it’s indicative of—you know, basically, the situation is, we have a longer-run\nshortage of housing, and we also have high rates right now. I think the best thing we can do for\nthe housing market is to restore price stability in a sustainable way and, and create a strong labor\nmarket, and that’s the best thing we can do for the housing market. You asked about the job\nPage 8 of 28\nJune 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nmarket—again, look at labor force participation. Look at wages. Look at job creation. They’re\nall at healthy levels now. I, I would say you can see perhaps a very, very slow continued\ncooling, but nothing that’s troubling at this time. But, you know, we watch it—we watch it very,\nvery carefully. So, overall, again, the current stance of monetary policy leaves us well\npositioned to respond in a timely way to economic developments, and—for now—and we’ll be\nwatching the data carefully.\nCHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Well, just quickly on—given that, you know, there are\nconcerns inflation will rise—but there is the alternate scenario that tariffs would create demand\ndestruction and slow growth sufficiently and that would perhaps keep a bit of a lid on inflation.\nDo you see odds of that scenario, what kind of odds do you see of that scenario coming true, and\nhow many months of cool inflation would you need to see before concluding that maybe that\nlower-inflation scenario is taking place?\nCHAIR POWELL. So this is very much the conversation we had today and yesterday.\nThere, there are many, many different scenarios—many combinations of scenarios where\ninflation does or doesn’t prove out to be at the levels we think and where the labor market does\nor doesn’t soften. And I think what, what you see people doing is looking ahead at a time of\nvery high uncertainty and writing down what they think the most likely case is. No one holds\nthese, these rate paths with a great deal of conviction, and everyone would agree that they’re all\ngoing to be data dependent. And that—you can make a case for, for any of the rate paths, I\nthink, that you see in, in the SEP. And, you know, we do this once a quarter. It’s—it’s a hard\nthing to do at this—particularly at this time. But it does reflect—you know, if you see somebody\nwriting down, you know, a, a rate path that involves cuts, that’s them saying, “Yes, I think we\nwill get to a place, more likely than not, where cuts will be appropriate.” And it could be—it\nPage 9 of 28\nJune 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ncould be a joint probability of a number of possible outcomes. Again, remember how much\nuncertainty we face, though.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Thank you. Mr. Chair, I wonder if you could describe for us some\nof those scenarios. How do you get to a place—I’m noticing that the uncertainty levels in your\nforecast are very high. How do you get to a place where you have the confidence in the outlook\nfor—say, inflation and/or growth or the unemployment rate—how many months does it take, and\nwhat do you want to see in the data to get to that level of confidence to actually reduce rates off\nthe restrictive level?\nCHAIR POWELL. So it’s—it’s—again, it’s very, very hard to say when that will\nhappen. We know that the time will come; it come—could come quickly. It could not come\nquickly. As long as the economy is solid, though—as long as we’re seeing the kind of labor\nmarket that we have and reasonably decent growth and inflation moving down, we feel like the\nright thing to do is to be where we are, with where our policy stance is, and just learn more. And\nin particular, we feel like we’re going to learn a great deal more over the summer on tariffs. We\ndo—we hadn’t expected them to show up much by now, and they haven’t, and we will see\nwhether—the extent to which they do over, over coming months. And I think that’s going to\ninform our thinking, for one thing. In addition, we’ll see how the labor market progresses. So,\nat some point, it will become clear. I can’t tell you exactly when that will be. And, you know,\nmeanwhile, we’ll be watching, watching the labor market very carefully for signs of weakness\nand strength and tariffs for signs of, of what’s going to happen there. And, of course, there are\nmany developments ahead, you know, even in the near term—developments are expected on\ntariffs. So I think we, we don’t yet know with any confidence where they will settle out. We\nPage 10 of 28\nJune 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nhave an estimate, and it’s a pretty—I think all estimates are now pretty close together. But it’s—\nit’s, yeah, highly uncertain.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. When you say “estimate”—estimate of the impact of tariffs on the\ncore PCE—is that what it is? And can you share that?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah, what you start with is, is—what’s the effective tariff rate\noverall? And people are managing to that. But, you know, the, the pass-through of tariffs to\nconsumer price inflation is a whole process that’s very uncertain. You know, as you know, there\nare many parties in that chain: There’s the manufacturer, the exporter, the importer, the retailer,\nand the consumer, and each one of those is going to be trying not to be the one to, to pay for the\ntariff. But together, they will all pay for it together—or maybe one party will pay it all. But that\nprocess is very hard to predict, and we haven’t been through a situation like this, and I think we\nhave to be humble about our ability to forecast it. So that’s why we need to see some actual data\nto have—to make better decisions. We, we’d like to get some, some more data, and, and, again,\nin the meantime, we can do that because the economy remains in solid condition.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nick.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, I guess I’m\nwondering if you could explain a little more the divergence we see in the dot plot, particularly\naround the 2025 rate projections. I realize this is—you know, you have one group of officials\nthat are putting down no cuts, another that are putting down more than one—and recognizing\nthat could be difficult to summarize, but is it a matter of people having a different outlook or a\ndifferent reaction function? A different commitment to defending against another inflation\nmistake? How, how did that play out over the last two days?\nPage 11 of 28\nJune 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. So you’re right, we—and, as is often the case, we have a pretty\nhealthy diversity of views on the Committee. We did have strong support for today’s decision\nand broad agreement that our policy stance does leave us in a good place. But I would point to\ntwo factors, and you mentioned them. The first is just that parties have a diversity of forecasts,\nand, and they do align with, with where—with where their dots are. So if you have a higher\ninflation forecast, you’re going to be less likely to be writing down, you know, more, more cuts.\nBut as—remember, as we see more data, we’re going to learn more about where inflation is\nheaded. And that means when it is time to look at, at normal—at sort of, at, you know—\nresuming our normalization process, the differences you may—you see should be smaller\nbecause we’ll have seen actual data. Right now, it’s just a forecast in a very foggy time. So\nthat’s the first part—is forecast.\nSecondly, people can look at the same data, and they can evaluate the risks differently, as\nyou know. And that includes, you know, the, the risk of higher inflation, the risk it’ll be more\npersistent, the risk that the labor market will weaken—people are going to have different\nassessments of that risk. So you put that in there, too. So those are the two ways that, that—the\ntwo things, I think, that drive these things. Remember, though, with—as I mentioned earlier—\nwith uncertainty as elevated as it is, no one holds these rate paths with a lot of conviction. So\nthat’s really where it is. It’s a function of those things, and I think as the data come in, you\nshould see those differences diminish.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. If I could follow up—you’ve said the policy is in a good place, and\nthat it’s modestly restrictive. Given all the uncertainty—you just talked about tariff levels,\nuncertainty around the pass-through—is it price increases versus margin compression?—some of\nPage 12 of 28\nJune 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthe softness that Chris talked about in, in labor and housing. Why wouldn’t it be better to have\nrates at a more neutral setting as the economy heads into this period of very high uncertainty?\nCHAIR POWELL. So if you just look backward at the data, that, that’s what you would\nsay, but that’s not—we have to be forward looking. And the thing that every forecaster—every\noutside forecaster and the Fed is saying is that we expect a meaningful amount of inflation to\narrive in coming months, and we have to take that into account. So I think a backward-looking\nlook would, would lead you to a neutral stance. But we, we can’t—we have to—we have to look\nat that. And because the economy is still solid, we can take the time to actually see what’s going\nto happen. It, it’s, you know, the—there’s a range of possibilities on how, how large the, the\ninflation effects and the other effects are going to be. So we’ll make smarter and better decisions\nif we just wait a couple of months or however long it takes to get a sense of, of really what, what\nis going to be the pass-through of inflation and what’re—what’s going to be the effects on\nspending and on hiring and all those things.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Mr. McKee.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television. Your\nfriend down at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue continues to lob insults in your direction. And I’m\nwondering, given now that the Supreme Court has maybe carved out the Fed from some of the\nlegal implications of that, whether this is just noise that the markets and everybody should ignore\nuntil your term is up or whether you worry that it could lead to more pressure on confidence on\nWall Street—on consumers—about the outlook for the economy.\nCHAIR POWELL. Okay, from my standpoint, it’s—it’s not complicated. What\neveryone on the FOMC wants is a good, solid American economy with a strong labor market\nand, and price stability. That’s what we want. We think our policy is well positioned to—right\nPage 13 of 28\nJune 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nnow to, to deliver that and, and to be able to respond in a timely way as the data lead us around.\nThe economy’s been resilient, and part of that is our stance, and, again, we think we’re—we’re\nin a good place on that to respond to significant economic developments. That’s what matters.\nThat is what matters to us—pretty much, that’s all that matters to us.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. I need to ask—assuming you are not reappointed, would you stay\non as Governor when your term as Chair ends?\nCHAIR POWELL. I’m—I’m not thinking about that. I’m thinking about this.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Andrew.\nANDREW ACKERMAN. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. I guess with workplace raids\nincreasing, picking up significantly—what kind of effect would that have on the labor market in\nthe short term?\nCHAIR POWELL. Sorry, sorry—with what picking up?\nANDREW ACKERMAN. Workplace raids.\nCHAIR POWELL. Ah, ah, immigration—so you’re asking immigration?\nANDREW ACKERMAN. Yeah.\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah, you know—I, I wouldn’t want to speculate. What—one way\nto get at that from an economic standpoint—we, of course, don’t comment on immigration\npolicy. It’s not ours to make or comment on. But what you see is a—an, an unemployment rate\nthat has been really solid and at a low level—not really increasing. It’s been in a—in a good\nrange and well within the range of mainstream estimates of maximum employment. And that\nmeans, like, part of that is that labor demand and labor supply are kind of moving down at the\nsame rate. Labor demand is, is softening—you see that in job creation—but it’s still kind of at a\nhealthy level. And labor supply is, is diminishing because the, the immigration numbers that we\nPage 14 of 28\nJune 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nsee are, are much lower than they were. So the—those two factors, supply and demand—that’s\nwhat has kept the, the unemployment rate in a reasonably, you know, stable place.\nANDREW ACKERMAN. Okay, thanks. The other thing I wanted to follow up on is if\nyou could—if you could elaborate on the potential changes to the SEP that you suggested were\npart of the framework review, I think.\nCHAIR POWELL. So the framework review really has two tracks, right? The first track\nis our—is our policy framework. That, that is reflected in the consensus statement. And we,\nwe’ve said that we would finish that and announce it by the end of the summer. So we’re well\nalong in that process. We’ve had the meetings that we need to have, and we’re now going to be\ngoing into [cough]—pardon me—into discussions about, you know, specific changes to\nlanguage. So that’s—that’s the framework part of it. The second part of it is our\ncommunications tools and practices [cough]—pardon me—and that, that part comes next, okay?\nThat’s what we’re going to do in the meetings this fall. Actually, what we did at this meeting,\nthough, is we, we sort of prepared the ground for that. We had a—we had a meeting where we\ntalked at a high level about a number of ideas.\nThe SEP is part of it—you know, other—many, many other ideas. It’s—it’s sort of—\nhow do we think our communications can be improved? There are a number of ideas. People\noffered a really—it was a great conversation. Number of ideas—but we’re—we’re going to look\nat those with staff briefing and a lot of thought in the fall. And I would say, when it comes to\nchanging communications, you know, I would only do—I would only support things really that\nonly—implement things that have very broad support. And also, you want to be really careful,\nbecause I think our communications are pretty well received. They’re not broken, so more is not\nPage 15 of 28\nJune 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nnecessarily better—but better is better. So we’re going to be looking at ways to do—to do things\nthat will improve the clarity of what we do for the benefit of, of the public.\nANDREW ACKERMAN. Thanks.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Kelly.\nKELLY O’GRADY. Thanks, Chair Powell. Kelly O’Grady, CBS News. You’re\nfamously known as the guy that makes decision based on data instead of speculation. You’ve\nsaid today in—the inflation data is in a good place—we don’t know how tariffs are going to\nimpact prices going forward—that’s uncertain. But I’ve got to go back to the last time that you\ncut rates in December, and there was still the what-if of tariffs. So what made you feel\ncomfortable cutting then, when inflation was higher than where it is today—and you didn’t cut\ntoday?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, the, the forecast for inflation in December was 2½ core PCE\nfor 2025—the forecast was 2½ percent—which is a good inflation forecast. I think what we’ve\nlearned is that—and this was long before we had any idea of what the actual policies would be.\nWe’ve learned the tariffs are going to be substantially larger than, than forecasters generally\nthought. And, you know, we, we don’t—our, our forecasts are generally not particularly\ndifferent from those of other, you know, well-resourced forecasting operations. So what we\nlearned—and particularly in April—was that substantially larger tariffs were coming and that\nthat would mean higher inflation. That’s what happened. And so you—now you see—you saw\n2½ percent forecast in December. You saw 2.8 percent in March, and you see 3.1 percent now.\nSo it’s six-tenths higher inflation for 2025, and that’s—that’s a big part of, of the change. And\nthat’s—that’s due to the effects of, of the tariffs that are—you know, we, we don’t know where\nPage 16 of 28\nJune 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthey’re going to land, but it’s pretty apparent they’re going to land higher than outside\nforecasters were really guessing at the end of last year.\nKELLY O’GRADY. My follow-up to that—I think consumers—right?—were looking\nfor relief on rates when it comes to mortgages—car loans. Small businesses want to take out\nmore manageable loans. When you look at the cumulative inflation over the past five years,\nprices have risen over 20 percent—it’s been a rough road. So what is the tipping point, then, for\nthe wait-and-see approach in terms of how much it’s going to help versus when it hurts the\nAmerican consumer?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, I mean, we’re trying to restore price—the best thing we can do\nfor the—for the public that we serve is restore price stability. If we can, and we will, restore\nprice stability, meaning 2 percent inflation on a durable, sustainable basis—that and also\nmaximum employment—and if we, we restore those things, that’s the best thing. And that is our\ngoal. The best thing we can do for the American people—for, for households and businesses—\nthat is the ultimate thing that we can deliver. And they can make their decisions without having\nto think about inflation all the time. So, in the meantime, we have to keep rates high to keep—to\nget inflation all the way down. They’re not very high—let’s be honest. I would say policy is\nmodestly or moderately—probably modestly now—restrictive. If you look at the economy, it’s\nnot performing as though it were performing under very strict monetary policy—very restrictive\nmonetary policy. So I would say probably modestly restrictive—and so what it will take is, is\nconfidence that inflation is coming down.\nNow, I would say, without tariffs, that confidence would be building because if you—if\nyou see what’s happening with nonhousing services and housing services, which are the other\ntwo big pieces other than goods, those are coming down really nicely now. So I think we have to\nPage 17 of 28\nJune 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nlearn a little more about, about tariffs. I don’t know—I don’t know what the right way for us to\nreact will be. I think it’s hard to know with, with any confidence how we should react until we\nsee, really, the size of the effects—then we can start to make a better judgment. So that’s what\nwe’re doing, and I think we can—we can take the time to do that, because unemployment is\n4.2 percent. Wages are moving up. Real wages are moving up at a—at a healthy clip now. And\ninflation is, you know—2.3 percent headline inflation over a 12-month basis. So it’s a good\neconomy, and a solid economy with decent growth.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Edward.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you, Chair Powell. So you’re saying that uncertainty\nhas come down, the economy is moving at a solid pace, inflation has come down over the past\nthree months, and this is all moving in the right direction. So are you indicating here that\nAmericans should expect some sort of economic pain in the second half of the year?\nCHAIR POWELL. I’m not—I’m not saying that at all. You know, from our standpoint,\nwhat I can say is that the, the U.S. economy is in solid shape. Inflation has come down. The\nunemployment rate remains at 4.2 percent. As I mentioned, real wages are moving up. It’s a—\nit’s a good—job creation is at a healthy level. Unemployment, again, as I said, low—labor force\nparticipation at a good place. What we’re waiting for to reduce rates is, is to understand what\nwill happen with, with, really, the tariff inflation. And there’s a lot of uncertainty about that.\nEvery forecaster you can name who, you know—who is a professional, you know, forecaster\nwith, with adequate resources and forecasts for a living is forecasting, you know, a pretty\nsignificant—everyone that I know is forecasting a meaningful increase in inflation in coming\nmonths from tariffs because someone has to pay for the tariffs. And it will be someone in that\nchain that I mentioned: Between the manufacturer, the exporter, the importer, the retailer—\nPage 18 of 28\nJune 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nultimately, somebody putting it into a, a good of some kind or just the consumer buying it—and,\nyou know, all through that, that chain, people will be trying not to be the ones who, who pick up\nthe cost. But, ultimately, the cost of the tariff has to be paid. And some of it will fall on the end\nconsumer. We know that because that’s what businesses say—that’s what the, the data say from\npast—so we know that’s coming. And we just want to see, see a little bit of that before we make\njudgments prematurely.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. And follow-up on that—so you’ve spent years, though,\ntalking about how, how you’re data dependent, and be a little more direct on this. You know,\nnow you’re making decisions looking forward—doesn’t the data you’re seeing today indicate\nthere should be a rate cut?\nCHAIR POWELL. No, I mean, you’re—monetary policy has to be forward looking.\nThat is elementary. You’ve got to be looking—I always—we always talk about the incoming\ndata, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. We say that over and over and over again,\nright? So it’s always forward looking. You know, if you know—at the very beginning of the\npandemic, you know, we cut rates to zero immediately. Nothing had happened. We just knew\nthat it was going to be really bad, right? So we took very aggressive forward looking—because\nwe knew things were going to be unusually difficult. So, of course, this, this is something we,\nwe sort of know is coming—we just don’t know the size of it. And, again, the economy seems to\nbe in solid shape. So the labor market’s not crying out for a rate cut. Businesses, you know,\nwere in a bit of shock after April 2. But you see business sentiment—you talk to business people\nnow—there’s a very different feeling now that people are working their way through this. And\nthey, they understand how they’re going to go, and it’s—it, it feels much more positive and\nPage 19 of 28\nJune 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nconstructive than it did three months ago, let’s say. So, again, we think that our current stance of\nmonetary policy is in a good place.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Amara.\nAMARA OMEOKWE. Thank you. Amara Omeokwe with Bloomberg. Chair Powell,\nin February, you told Congress that the Fed is “overworked, maybe, not overstaffed.” Then, in a\nmemo to—a memo to staff in May announcing a deferred resignation program at the Fed, you\nsaid you wanted to ensure that the Fed was “right-sized.” Those two statements appear to be at\nodds with one another. Could you explain what changed in the roughly three months between\nthose statements that made you decide that staff levels at the Fed should decline?\nCHAIR POWELL. I don’t see them at all as, as in tension. You know, so I was asked,\n“Is the Fed overstaffed?” And I said, “No.” You know, and I sort of said as a pun,\n“Overworked, but not overstaffed.” People do work extremely hard at the Fed, and I know they\nwork hard at Bloomberg, too. [Laughter] So—but we do. We work hard. But I would say\nthis—so we are careful stewards of public resources, and sometimes you need to show that. So\nthere’ve been several times in our history—modern history—where the Fed has said, “You know\nwhat? We’re going to do a buyout. We’re going to—going to show the public. We’re going to\ndemonstrate that we are good stewards of public resources.” So we thought—and I, I thought—\nthat this is a time when we can. You know, we’ve—we grow about—our headcount has grown\nat about 1 percent a year. So over the course of a couple of years, we’re going to—we’re doing a\ncareful scrub of the Board and all of the Reserve Banks, and we’re going to find 10 percent of\nemployees who can do something else.\nWhere, where we can—we can streamline our operations—and we, we think we can get\nthere in a year, in a couple of years. We think we can do that. And we think the—we think the,\nPage 20 of 28\nJune 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthe—this is, this is without taking risk to carrying out our critical missions. So this is something\nyou do very carefully—thoughtfully. And you do it, again, respecting that we have critical\nmissions to carry out. I’ve had experience—a lot of experience—in my prior careers, you know,\nwith headcount reductions and things like that, and this is how you do it professionally. You do\nit carefully—thoughtfully—with a lot of planning, and you do it over a period of time. And I, I\nthink it’s—I think the Fed will be fine. I think no one will notice any decline in our ability to\ncarry out our missions, and I think it’s just us wanting to demonstrate to the public that we are\nactually good stewards of their—of their resources. We’re—we’re effectively wiping out\n10 years of headcount growth with this. So, I mean, we just—we wanted to show that, you\nknow—that we’re good stewards.\nAMARA OMEOKWE. How is progress on reducing the headcount going so far? Are\nyou on track to meet the goal?\nCHAIR POWELL. We’re just at the very beginning. As you know, we’re doing a\nbuyout program. We’re going to—we’re going to hit that goal. I think many organizations find\nthat they can—that they can do this. You don’t want to do it every year or anything, but you can\ndo it at intervals. And you, you wind up not, you know—not interfering with your ability to\nperform your jobs.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Claire.\nCLAIRE JONES. Chair Powell, Claire Jones from the Financial Times. As you’re no\ndoubt aware, the Senate Finance Committee has tabled its version of the reconciliation bill this\nweek, and I was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about the tenor of the debate at the\nFOMC over the past few days on fiscal policy and the degree to which that influenced people’s\nprojections for 2026 and beyond. Thank you.\nPage 21 of 28\nJune 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah, so, you know, we don’t—we don’t sit around and debate or\nreally discuss—we, we take fiscal policy as fully exogenous. And so we, we actually, you know,\nreally didn’t talk about, about the bill or the contents of it. It’s still evolving. You know, when,\nwhen it gets close—closer—remember also we have a very, very large economy, and that the\neffects will be at the margin. And, you know, I, I expect that they’ll—they may already be in—\nbut they will be in by the next meeting. We’ll make an estimate. But it’s not a major thing; it’s\nnothing that we discuss. It, it may have been mentioned a couple of times—but as something\nthat’s coming in. But I think the outcome is—you know, we don’t know the outcome yet\nthere—so, hard to be real specific.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Neil.\nNEIL IRWIN. Thanks, Chair Powell. Neil Irwin with Axios. There’ve been some\ncutbacks in economic statistics collection in the last few weeks—worries that long-running\nproblems around funding and response rates may be getting worse. How much is this concern on\nyour radar? How much confidence do you have that the gauges you’re watching to assess the\neconomy are reliable right now?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, two things—one, the data we get right now—we, we can\ndo our jobs. I’m not concerned that we can’t do our jobs. That’s not the—that’s not the point.\nThe point, really, is that we are starting to see, you know, layoffs. And, and important gatherers\nof data are saying that they’re—they’re having to cut back on the size of their surveys. That’s\ngoing to lead to more volatility in the surveys. I think we should take a step back. And, you\nknow, from our standpoint—and I think the standpoint of businesses and governments and\neveryone—having really good data on the state of the economy at any given time is a huge\npublic good. It helps. It doesn’t just help the Fed. It helps the government, it helps Congress, it\nPage 22 of 28\nJune 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nhelps the executive branch. More importantly, really, it helps businesses. They need to know\nwhat’s going on in the economy. The United States has been a leader for many, many years in\nthis whole project of measuring and understanding what’s happening in, in our very large and\ndynamic economy.\nAnd I hate to see—I hate to see us cutting back on that because it, it is a real benefit to\nthe general public that people in all kinds of jobs have the best possible understanding of what’s\nhappening in the economy and, and, hence, what’s likely to happen. It’s very hard to measure\nwhat’s going on in the U.S. economy. If, if you read—there was a book called—well, it’s really\nremarkable how many things you need to understand to estimate U.S. GDP. Very, very\ndifficult—and it’s so important that we get it right. I just would—I just would say it’s not a\nplace to—I would want to keep investing in that, you know, for the good of the general public.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi. Victoria Guida with Politico. So you’re conducting this\nmonetary policy strategy framework review, but next year we’re supposed to have a new Fed\nChair, and I’m wondering if that affects at all the way that you’re approaching this. How do you\nensure that this framework will actually be durable?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, the framework goes back to—the framework document\ngoes back to 2012, and it’s—it’s the Committee’s document. It’s not like we’re going to invent a\nbrand new way to do things. It’s—it’s been an evolving document, so it shouldn’t depend on\nwho the Chair is at all. It should depend on what’s happening in the economy and what the\nCommittee wants to do. So, yeah, it isn’t really tied to any particular Chair, and, you know, we\nused to renew it every year. Now we do it every five years. So—but I, I don’t think anybody—\nI’ve never heard anyone raise this issue that, you know, a new Chair might want to come in and\nPage 23 of 28\nJune 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ngo in a completely different direction. I really—I really don’t think that’s right. But, you know,\nthat’s not—not going to be up to me to decide.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Is that affecting at all that you’re—who you’re consulting with—\nCHAIR POWELL. No, not at all. Not in any way.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Matt.\nMATT EGAN. Thank you, Chair Powell. Matt Egan from CNN. Relatively low gas\nprices this year have helped drive down inflation in recent reports, but that trend is starting to\nreverse, given the crisis in the Middle East. How are you thinking about how the Israel–Iran\nconflict will impact the economy, especially inflation, and what lessons were learned during the\n2022 period when another conflict, the Russia–Ukraine war, sent oil and gas prices\nskyrocketing?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, of course, we’re watching—like everybody else is—what’s going\non. I really don’t have any comment on that. You know, possible that, that we’ll see higher\nenergy prices—what’s tended to happen is, when there’s turmoil in the Middle East, you may see\na spike in energy prices—but tends to come down. Those things don’t generally tend to have\nlasting effects on inflation, although, of course, in the 1970s, they famously did, because you had\na series of very, very large shocks. But we haven’t seen anything like that—that—like that now.\nThe U.S. economy is far less dependent on foreign oil than it was back in the 1970s. So, but—\nMATT EGAN. A quick follow-up—I’ve just got to ask you about artificial intelligence.\nSome technology executives have recently been warning that AI could wipe out a large chunk of\nentry-level jobs and significantly increase the unemployment rate. I’m wondering how\nconcerned you are, if at all, about the threat that AI poses to employment.\nPage 24 of 28\nJune 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. So this is the question. The question really is, will AI be more\naugmenting labor or replacing labor? And I wouldn’t—I, I—we all see those announcements,\nincluding one today. I wouldn’t overread a, a couple of data points, because, you know, AI\nshould be creating jobs at the same time. It may be replacing—it may be doing both. Anyone\nwho’s done any work with it—with AI—will, will have been a little bit stunned at how capable it\nis. And it’s just a different thing. So I think this is something that certainly has transformational\npotential—and probably we’re in the very early stages of it. They say what you’re seeing now\ncompared to what you’ll see in two years is, is going to be very different and even more\neffective. So I think it’s really hard to know. You know, of course, there are optimists who feel\nlike it’s going to make everybody much more, you know—much more productive. And there are\nthose who think it’s going to replace an awful lot of jobs right across the income spectrum—you\nknow, white collar, blue collar, and everything. So I just don’t know. We don’t—we don’t have\na “house view” on that. But this is—this is going to be a very important question for some time.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Greg.\nGREG ROBB. Thank you. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. I was wondering if you\ncould step back a little bit, Chair Powell. You know, there’s a spate of articles and a lot of op-\neds now in the newspapers saying that the U.S. economy and the global economy is going\nthrough this profound change, you know, akin to the end of the Bretton Woods era in the 1970s.\nAnd don’t you owe the American people, like, some sort of, like, explanation for what we’re\ngoing through? I mean, I, I noticed earlier this month when you, you talked about Bretton\nWoods a little bit, and you said that Bretton Woods—the Fed staff had to, like, change how\nthey’ve—the dollar—movements of the dollar was impacting the economy. Are we going\nPage 25 of 28\nJune 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthrough something like that now—that, you know—are you having to change how you do\nmonetary policy? Is it—is it that fundamental of a change under way? Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. It’s—it’s certainly a time of real change—you know, from a\ngeopolitical standpoint, from a trade standpoint, from an immigration standpoint—you see this\nnot just here, but everywhere. So there’s—there’s quite a lot going on. It doesn’t change the\nway we do monetary policy in the near term. I mean, but—and it doesn’t change our objectives\nor what we need to do. And, you know, these, these things are not really our issues—they’re\nreally issues for elected governments. All of those issues are really for elected governments.\nBut there’s no question it’s a time of, of real, real change—and very hard to see where that goes.\nWill it be—there have been many, many things written about how it’s going to be a more\ninflationary time. That’s possible; it’s not guaranteed. You know, AI could cut in a very other\ndirection. AI could make people much more productive and—and push in the other direction. I\ndon’t know, though. So you’re right, but, honestly, our focus is, is a much more practical one,\nand that is, how do we keep inflation low and, and employment high in the near term? That’s\nreally what we’re about.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Mark. Mark Hamrick.\nMARK HAMRICK. Thank you. Hello, Chairman Powell. Mark Hamrick with\nBankrate. What is the view about the growing amount of slack in the job market, including the\nsoftening in payrolls, the forecast of a modest rise in the unemployment rate, and the ability of\nworkers to demand wage hikes or not in this environment where you have inflation surging?\nCHAIR POWELL. I don’t, you don’t see—you don’t really see unemployment going up.\nYou don’t see increased slack, really—I mean, at the margin. Remember, you’re at 4.2 percent\nunemployment. That, that was for many, many years—that was an extremely low level. It\nPage 26 of 28\nJune 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nhappens to have come up off of an even lower level. As we came out of the pandemic, we were\nas low as 3.4 percent. But 4.2 percent is probably at the low end of estimates of the longer-run,\nyou know, sustainable level of natural rate of unemployment. So I wouldn’t—I guess I wouldn’t\nagree with that. And also, in terms of wages—you know, real wages after inflation have been\nmoving up sort of more than was consistent with 2 percent inflation. They’re still moving up at\na—at a healthy clip—and I think much more consistent with 2 percent inflation, given, given a, a\nreasonable assessment of, of trend productivity. So it’s a pretty good labor market. You know,\nyou’re right that the level of job creation has come down, but so has the supply of workers—the\nchange in the supply—the, the new supply.\nSo you’ve seen—you’ve seen the unemployment rate remain pretty stable at 4.2. It’s\nbeen as high as 4.3, but, you know, those are—those are good numbers. So it’s a pretty good\nlabor market. There’s—the thing is, there’s—a more concerning thing is, there’s not—there are\nnot a lot of layoffs, but there are not a lot of, of job creation. The number—if you’re out of\nwork, it’s—it’s hard to find a job. But very few people are being laid off at this point. So\nthat’s—an equilibrium we watch very, very carefully, because if there were to be, you know,\nsignificant layoffs and the job-finding rate were to remain this low, you would have a lot—you\nwould have an increase in unemployment fairly quickly. But that hasn’t happened. It really\nhasn’t happened. We’re—so the U.S. economy has defied all kinds of forecasts for it to, to\nweaken, really, over the last three years, and it’s been remarkable to see—just again and again\nwhen people think it’s going to weaken out. Eventually it will, but we don’t see signs of\nthat now.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Go to Jean for the last question.\nPage 27 of 28\nJune 18, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nJEAN YUNG. Hi, Chair Powell. Jean Yung with MNI Market News. There’s been a lot\nof talk about cuts. I wanted to ask you—why do you think there are no forecasts for rates to rise\nor, or even to stay where they are next year, given that the projection for inflation is to rise to\n3 percent and there’s a lot of—there’s some skepticism over whether those price hikes will be a\none-time event?\nCHAIR POWELL. So there are a number of people on the Committee who wrote down\nno cuts this year but some cuts next year. So, look, I think, you know, people are writing down\ntheir most likely path, right? They’re not saying there’s zero possibility of other things, really.\nReally, it’s—think of it as the least unlikely path in a situation like this where uncertainty is very\nhigh. I, I think—again, people write—they write down their, their rate paths, and they do not\nhave, like, a really high conviction that this is exactly what’s going to happen over the next two\nyears. No one feels that way about their rate path. They feel like, “What am I going to write\ndown?” I mean, what would you write down? It’s not easy to, to be—to do that with\nconfidence.\nSo I would just say it that way. We don’t rule things in or out—certainly, a hike is not\nthe base case at all. It’s not something people are writing down. But, in the meantime, we do the\nbest we can with these forecasts, and I, I think they’re—they’re representative of, you know, of\nthe different forecasts and different reaction functions that people on the Committee have.\nSo thank you very much. Thanks.\nPage 28 of 28"

    "press_conf": "July 30, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nTranscript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference\nJuly 30, 2025\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on\nachieving our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of\nthe American people. Despite elevated uncertainty, the economy is in a solid position. The\nunemployment rate remains low, and the labor market is at or near maximum employment.\nInflation has been running somewhat above our 2 percent longer-run objective.\nIn support of our goals, today the Federal Open Market Committee decided to leave our\npolicy interest rate unchanged. We believe that the current stance of monetary policy leaves us\nwell positioned to respond in a timely way to potential economic developments. I will have\nmore to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.\nRecent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity has moderated. GDP rose at a\n1.2 percent pace in the first half of this year, down from 2.5 percent last year. Although the\nincrease in the second quarter was stronger at 3 percent, focusing on the first half of the year\nhelps smooth through the volatility in the quarterly figures related to the unusual swings in net\nexports. The moderation in growth largely reflects a slowdown in consumer spending. In\ncontrast, business investment in equipment and intangibles picked up from last year’s pace.\nActivity in the housing sector remains weak.\nIn the labor market, conditions have remained solid. Payroll job gains averaged\n150,000 per month over the past three months. The unemployment rate, at 4.1 percent, remains\nlow and has stayed in a narrow range over the past year. Wage growth has continued to\nmoderate while still outpacing inflation. Overall, a wide set of indicators suggests that\nconditions in the labor market are broadly in balance and consistent with maximum employment.\nPage 1 of 24\nJuly 30, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nInflation has eased significantly from its highs in mid-2022 but remains somewhat\nelevated relative to our 2 percent longer-run goal. Estimates based on the consumer price index\nand other data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.5 percent over the 12 months ending in June\nand that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose\n2.7 percent. These readings are little changed from the beginning of the year, although the\nunderlying composition of price changes has shifted: Services inflation has continued to ease,\nwhile increased tariffs are pushing up prices in some categories of goods. Near-term measures of\ninflation expectations have moved up, on balance, over the course of this year on news about\ntariffs, as reflected in both market-based and survey-based measures. Beyond the next year or\nso, however, most measures of longer-term expectations remain consistent with our 2 percent\ninflation goal.\nOur monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people. At today’s meeting, the Committee\ndecided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4¼ to 4½ percent and to\ncontinue reducing the size of our balance sheet. We will continue to determine the appropriate\nstance of monetary policy based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of\nrisks.\nChanges to government policies continue to evolve, and their effects on the economy\nremain uncertain. Higher tariffs have begun to show through more clearly to prices of some\ngoods, but their overall effects on economic activity and inflation remain to be seen. A\nreasonable base case is that the effects on inflation could be short lived—reflecting a one-time\nshift in the price level. But it is also possible that the inflationary effects could instead be more\npersistent, and that is a risk to be assessed and managed.\nPage 2 of 24\nJuly 30, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nOur obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored and to prevent\na one-time increase in the price level from becoming an ongoing inflation problem. For the time\nbeing, we are well positioned to learn more about the likely course of the economy and the\nevolving balance of risks before adjusting our policy stance. We see our current policy stance as\nappropriate to guard against inflation risks. We are also attentive to risks on the employment\nside of our mandate. In coming months, we will receive a good amount of data that will help\ninform our assessment of the balance of risks and the appropriate setting of the federal funds\nrate.\nAt this meeting, the Committee continued its discussions as part of our five-year review\nof our monetary policy framework. We focused on potential revisions to our Statement on\nLonger-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy and are on track to wrap up any modifications\nby late summer.\nThe Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy—maximum employment and\nprice—stable prices. We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing\ninflation sustainably to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer-term inflation expectations well\nanchored. Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans. We understand\nthat our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we\ndo is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our\nmaximum-employment and price-stability goals. Thank you. I look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Howard.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thanks. Thanks, Chair Powell. There is a lot of “lean” in the\nmarkets and, not to mention, out of the Administration, for a rate cut now in September. Is that\nexpectation unrealistic at this point?\nPage 3 of 24\nJuly 30, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. So, as you know, today we decided to leave our policy rate where it’s\nbeen, which—where I would characterize as modestly restrictive. Inflation is running a bit\nabove 2 percent, as I mentioned, even excluding tariff effects. The labor market’s solid—\nhistorically low unemployment. Financial conditions are accommodative, and the economy is\nnot—the economy is not performing as though restrictive policy were holding it back\ninappropriately. So it seems to, to me and to almost the whole Committee that the economy is\nnot performing as though restrictive policy is holding it back inappropriately, and modestly\nrestrictive policy seems appropriate.\nAll that said, there’s also downside risk to the labor market. In coming months, we’ll\nreceive a good amount of data that will help inform our assessment of the balance of risks and\nthe appropriate setting of the federal funds rate.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. So just to follow up: By, by “coming months,” does that\ninclude the possibility you’ll, you’ll be getting essentially two rounds of jobs and inflation data\nbetween now and the September meeting? Is that potentially adequate to make a decision to\nlower rates at that point?\nCHAIR POWELL. So you’re right. We do have—this is an, an, an intermeeting period\nwhen we’ll get two full rounds of employment and inflation data before the time of the\nSeptember meeting. We have made no decisions about September—we don’t do that in advance.\nWe’ll be taking that information into consideration and all the other information we get as we\nmake our decision at the September meeting.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You took out the word—or the notion\nthat uncertainty has diminished from this statement. Does that mean uncertainty has increased?\nPage 4 of 24\nJuly 30, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nAnd I’m just wondering, the Administration has struck several deals with large trading partners\nwhere it seems like we now know what the rate is going to be. Does knowing that rate add to\nyour certainty to change policy, or do you need to wait to see the economic effects?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, essentially, the statement in the—in the—in our statement about\nuncertainty reflects what’s gone on since the last meeting. So, at the time of the last meeting,\nuncertainty had, had, had moved down a little bit, but it was more or less even this time. So we\ntook out, you know, “had diminished” because it didn’t diminish further. So there’s not really\nmuch in that. And then your second question is—say again?\nSTEVE LIESMAN. There have been several deals that have been struck, and now we\nseem to have an idea of what the tariff rates are going to be with some of our large trading\npartners. Does that not add to the kind of certainty you might need, or is it you’re waiting for the\neconomic effects to show, show themselves?\nCHAIR POWELL. No, I think we’re still—so you’re right, it’s been a very dynamic\ntime for these trade negotiations, and lots and lots of events in the intermeeting period, but we’re\nstill, you know, a ways away from seeing where things settle down. We are clearly getting more\nand more information. And, you know, I think at this point, people’s estimates, our estimates,\noutside estimates of the—of the likely, you know, effective, effective level of tariffs is, is not\nmoving around that much at this point. But at the same time, there are many, many uncertainties\nleft to resolve. So, yes, we are learning more and more. It doesn’t feel like we’re very close to\nthe end of that process. And that’s, that’s not for us to judge, but it does—it feels like there’s\nmuch more to come, you know, as well looking ahead.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Neil.\nPage 5 of 24\nJuly 30, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nNEIL IRWIN. Hi, Mr. Chairman. Neil Irwin with Axios. This morning, we got a GDP\nreport in which final domestic private purchases decelerated—slowest pace since ’22. There was\na weakness in the interest-sensitive sectors and residential investment, commercial structures.\nAre those not signs that monetary policy is a little too restrictive right now, given current\neconomic conditions?\nCHAIR POWELL. So the GDP and PDFP numbers came in pretty much right where we\nexpected them to come in. You’ve got to look at the whole picture. So, certainly, as I mentioned\nin my opening remarks, economic activity data, GDP, private domestic final purchases—which\nwe think is a narrower but better signal for future, for where the economy is going—has come\ndown to a little better than 1 percent, 1.2 percent I think, in the case of GDP for the first half,\nwhereas it was 2½ last year. So that has certainly come down. But if you look at the labor\nmarket, what you see is, by many, many statistics, the labor market is kind of still in balance.\nIt’s things like quits, you know, job openings, and—let alone the unemployment rate. They’re\nall very—by many measures, very similar to where they were a year ago. So you do not see a\nweakening in the labor market. You do see a slowing in job creation, but also in a slowing—a\nslowing in the supply of workers. So you’ve got a labor market that’s in balance, albeit partially\nbecause both demand and supply for workers has—is coming down at the same pace, and that’s\nwhy the unemployment rate has remained roughly, roughly stable, which is why I said there—we\ndo see downside risk in the labor market. I mean, our two—our two mandate variables—\nright?—are inflation and maximum employment—stable prices and maximum employment, not\nso much growth. So the labor market looks, looks solid. Inflation is above target. And even if\nyou—if you look through the tariff effects, we think it’s still a bit above target. And that’s why\nPage 6 of 24\nJuly 30, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nour stance is where it is. But, as I mentioned, you know, downside risks to the labor market are\ncertainly apparent.\nNEIL IRWIN. So on labor, given the fluid labor supply situation, is there a number for\nthis jobs report we get on Friday that would look to you like equilibrium job growth?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, the, the main number you have to look at now is the\nunemployment rate, because if, if—it’s true that the, you know, demand for workers in the form\nof, let’s call it—say—just say, payroll jobs—that number has come down, but so has the\nbreakeven number, kind of in tandem. So, you know, as long as the—that puts the labor market\nin, in balance. The fact that it’s getting into balance due to declines in both supply and demand,\nthough, I think does—it is suggestive of downside risk. So we’re—of course, we’ll be watching\nthat carefully.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Colby.\nCOLBY SMITH. Thank you. Colby Smith with the New York Times. Two of your\ncolleagues called for a quarter-point cut today, and I’m wondering what aspects of their\nargument were most compelling to you and how you are weighing their views against those on\nthe Committee who, as of the June forecast, were in the camp of the Fed holding interest rates\nsteady for the remainder of the year. And, and just in terms of the June SEP in particular, is that\nstill the best representation of where the core of the Committee is?\nCHAIR POWELL. So on, on the dissents, you know, what you—what you want from\neverybody and also from a dissenter is a clear explanation for—of what your thinking is and\nwhat are the arguments you’re making. And that’s—we had that today. So I think, basically,\nthis was—this was quite a good meeting all around the table where people were—you know,\nthought carefully about this and put their positions out there. As I mentioned, you know, the,\nPage 7 of 24\nJuly 30, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthe—sort of the majority of the Committee was of the view that inflation’s a bit above target,\nmaximum employment is at target. That calls for modestly restrictive—in my way of thinking, a\nmodestly restrictive stance of policy for now. But we had two dissenters who, I think—you\nknow, you want that clear thinking and, and, and, you know, expression of your thinking, and we\ncertainly had that today, I think all around the table. In terms of—you asked about the June SEP.\nYou know, I wouldn’t—you’re right that that’s what it—that’s what it says, and that may—that\nmay well—I, I couldn’t point to it six weeks later as, as expressing people’s thought—you really\ncan’t do that. We don’t run an SEP, and I don’t like to substitute in my own estimate of what the\nSEP might be. We don’t have one. So I’ll just say that, you know, we, we haven’t made any\ndecisions about September. We’ll be monitoring all the incoming data and asking ourselves\nwhether the federal funds rate is in the right place.\nCOLBY SMITH. And, just on the point about policy being only modestly restrictive,\ndoes that mean that there’s actually not much scope to reduce rates once the conditions for a cut\nare met, barring a significant weakening of the labor market?\nCHAIR POWELL. So let me say, my own estimate is modestly restrictive. And there\nare—there are a range of views of what the neutral rate is at this moment for, for our economy.\nAnd so others may say it’s more restrictive or less restrictive even. You know, we’re—we’re\ngoing to be—at some point, when we return to moving toward a more neutral stance, we’ll be\nmaking that judgment as we go. I don’t think we have a preset course. It’s not so mechanical as\nsaying, you know, “We’ve derived with great confidence the neutral rate, and that is our\ndestination,” because, really, we understand that no one actually knows what the neutral rate is.\nWe know it by its works, and that will be how—the way the economy reacts over time to—you\nknow, to slightly looser policy.\nPage 8 of 24\nJuly 30, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nick.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, my question\nis about, what have you learned over the last few months about the inflation-generating and price\npass-through process? And just to drill down: The June CPI report showed evidence of tariff-\ninduced goods inflation. Now the tariff landscape is only starting to be settled with some of\nthese more recent deals. Given the lags between when tariffs are announced and when they\nshow up in goods prices, is two months a long enough horizon to evaluate the impact and be\nconfident that tariffs aren’t impacting the broader inflation process?\nCHAIR POWELL. I think you have to think of this as still quite early days. And so I\nthink what we’re seeing now is substantial amounts of tariff revenue being collected, on the\norder of $30 billion a month, which is, you know, substantially higher than, than before. And the\nevidence seems to be, mostly not paid, but paid only to a small extent, through exporters\nlowering their price. And companies or retailers, sort of people who are upstream—institutions\nthat are upstream from the consumer, are paying most of this for now. Consumers are—it’s\nstarting to show up in consumer prices. As you know, in the June report, we expect to see more\nof that. And we know from surveys that companies feel that they have every intention of, of, of\nputting this through to the consumer. But, you know, the truth is, they may not be able to in\nmany cases. So I think it’s—we’re just going to have to watch and learn empirically how much\nof this and over what period of time. I think we’ve learned that the process will probably be\nslower than, than expected at the beginning, but we never expected it to be fast. And we think\nwe have a long way to go to really understand exactly how we’ll be. So that’s how we’re\nthinking of it right now.\nPage 9 of 24\nJuly 30, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nNICK TIMIRAOS. So if I could follow up, is the reticence to “look through” core goods\ninflation being driven by the judgment that during the pandemic, expectations proved more\nadaptive than anyone at the Fed expected? Is it being driven by uncertainty over how restrictive\npolicy is?\nCHAIR POWELL. You could argue we are, a bit, “looking through” goods inflation by\nnot raising rates. You know, we haven’t reacted to, to new inflation. But, I mean, I wouldn’t—I\nwouldn’t insist upon that. But I don’t think—I think the base case—I said—as I said, a\nreasonable base case is that these are one-time—one-time price effects. Of course, in the end,\nthere, there will not be. This will not turn out to be inflation, because we’ll make sure that it’s\nnot. We will, through our tools, make sure that this does not move from being a one-time price\nincrease to serious inflation. We want to do that efficiently, though, efficiently. And that means\nwe want to do it—if you—if you move too soon, you wind up maybe not getting inflation all the\nway fixed, and you have to come back. That’s inefficient. If you move too late, you might do\ntoo—unnecessary damage to the labor market. So there won’t be, in the end, a big inflationary\nproblem. What we’re trying to do is accomplish that in a way that is efficient. But in the end,\nthere should be no doubt that we will do what we need to do to keep inflation under control.\nIdeally, we do it efficiently.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Michael.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio. The One\nBig Bill, leaving aside the adjectives—do you expect it to add stimulus to the economy in 2026?\nAnd would that be an argument for remaining on hold or cutting back on the number of rate cuts\nyou would expect for next year?\nPage 10 of 24\nJuly 30, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. So, of course, let me just—ritual disclaimer that we don’t express\nany judgments or anything, right, on, on fiscal legislation or other legislation, for that matter.\nBut I would say, when you think that, you know, the biggest part of the bill was, was making\npermanent existing law on, on taxes, I don’t think we see it as particularly stimulative. There\nshould be some stimulative effect, but it shouldn’t be significant over the next couple of years.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. And to follow up, what do you—well, I don’t want to put this in\nterms of you and the President, so let me ask it this way: Do you have concerns about the cost to\nthe government of keeping rates elevated for longer in terms of interest rate charges?\nCHAIR POWELL. No, that’s—you know, we, we have a mandate, and that’s maximum\nemployment and price stability. And it is—it’s not something we do, to consider the cost to the\ngovernment of our rate changes. We have to be able to look at the goal variables Congress has\ngiven us—use the tools they have given us to achieve those goals. And that’s what we do.\nIt’s—we don’t consider the fiscal needs of the federal government. No advanced-economy\ncentral bank does that. And it wouldn’t be good for—if we did do that, it would be good neither\nfor our credibility nor for the credibility of U.S. fiscal policy. So it’s just not something we, we\ntake into consideration.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi. Victoria Guida with Politico. When it comes to the\nrenovations of the Federal Reserve’s headquarters that the Administration has been looking into,\ndo you see their interest in that issue as being directly tied to the President’s push to get you to\nlower interest rates?\nCHAIR POWELL. Not for me to say. I will say, we had a—we had a nice visit with the\nPresident. It was an honor to host him. It’s not something that happens very often at the Federal\nPage 11 of 24\nJuly 30, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nReserve—to have the President come over, let alone to visit a building—but it was—it was a\ngood visit.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Are there any aspects of the project that they’ve raised that you see\nas making you reconsider any aspects of the project?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, you know, we—this project was hatched and conceived almost a\ndecade ago now, and we went through the very long process of clearing it through historic\npreservation at the National Capital Planning Commission and a lot of back-and-forth there. It\nwas very constructive. We started out to do the work, and we’re very well along on that work.\nAnd I was quite pleased to have the President say multiple times that what he really wanted to\nsee was, was us getting this construction completed as soon as possible. That is our focus, and\nthat’s what we’re going to do.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Andrew.\nANDREW ACKERMAN. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Andrew Ackerman with the\nWashington Post. What message do you take from the fact that inflation hit 2.1 percent last\nSeptember and has bounced higher since? Why do you think financial conditions are restrictive\nand in neutral rates below 4 percent when inflation has stopped falling for almost a year?\nCHAIR POWELL. So inflation—when you talk about these 12-month inflation\nmeasures, you’re always battling residual seasonality. So we’ll have, for example, two months\nof high inflation, sometimes early in the year, and then inflation turns lower. And a lot of that\nmay just be an artifact. So that’s why we look at the 12-month numbers. I—look, I think\ninflation is most of the way back to 2 percent. There are things like the catch-up inflation. So,\nfor example, all the insurance costs that are now—they’re only now going through inflation, but\nthey actually reflect inflationary pressures from two, three years ago. So there’s—that’s got to\nPage 12 of 24\nJuly 30, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ngo through. In addition, now we have, you know, three- or four-tenths of inflation in core\ninflation from tariffs. So—and we, we, we can’t really separate that out. We’re not going to\nhave a separate, you know, kind of inflation that isn’t the tariffs. We’re always going to be\ndealing with the whole—all of inflation. But we—the composition, as I mentioned, has really\nchanged. And, you know, if you go back to the last couple of years, it was all about services\ninflation, which was being very sticky. Now services inflation is coming down nicely. Goods\ninflation was well behaved before, and now goods inflation is going up. So the story has really\nchanged. That’s partially because of tariffs. It’s also partially because we had restrictive policy\nin place, and we—and we’ve seen that—the result of that gradually work its way through the\nservices economy.\nANDREW ACKERMAN. Okay. The other thing I wanted to ask is, are you comfortable\nthat BLS can continue performing their mission effectively if they take an 8 percent reduction in\nhead count and authorized spending, as the Administration has proposed?\nCHAIR POWELL. I’m not going to comment on the Administration’s proposal. I do\nthink—as I’ve said, I think that we—you know, we’re, we’re getting the data that we need to do\nour jobs. And I think it’s really important that, that good data helps not just the Fed—it helps the\ngovernment, but it also helps the private sector. You know, people in the economy—they, they\nuse this data a lot, too. So it’s quite important for our economy and, certainly, for the Fed’s work\nand other government agencies’ work that we—that we continue to get better at data. That’s\nwhat we’ve been doing for 100 years. We’ve been getting better and better and better. It’s very\nhard to accurately capture in real time the output of a $20-plus trillion economy. And the United\nStates has been a leader in that for 100 years, and we really need to continue that, in my view.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Edward.\nPage 13 of 24\nJuly 30, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Edward Lawrence from Fox\nBusiness. How concerned are you, with, with the data that we’re showing—coming in showing\nno significant upward trend in inflation over the past six months, that the wait-and-see approach\nfor inflation is actually giving companies cover to raise prices?\nCHAIR POWELL. How concerned am I that the—say that again.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. That the wait-and-see approach is getting—\nCHAIR POWELL. The wait-and-see approach—what do you mean by that?\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. For, for cutting rates. You’re waiting to see if the tariffs will\naffect inflation. So it’s a wait-and-see approach so that—\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, so that—you know, that would—that’s where we’re—policy’s\nrestrictive. When we start cutting, it’ll go toward neutral.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Okay. This delay, though, where you’re saying it’s a one-\ntime—one-time price increase for tariffs, which they—which possibly could lead into bigger\ninflation or more inflation, is that giving companies cover, though, to raise prices?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, what, what may be giving—it’s not our policy stance. What\nmay be giving—some companies will certainly be taking advantage of the fact of the tariffs and\nall of the discussion of how they’re going to—you know, companies will raise prices when and\nas they can. And you—so you saw it famously in the—in the—in the first Administration of\nPresident Trump, during those tariffs. Washing machines were tariffed, but, but, but dryers\nweren’t. But what do you know? Price—the price of dryers went up, too, just like washing\nmachines. So companies will often just take—they’ll cross the street in a group, if you know\nwhat I mean. That’ll happen. We don’t see a lot of that. I mean, what we see now is basically\nthe very beginnings of whatever the effects turn out to be on goods inflation. And, you know,\nPage 14 of 24\nJuly 30, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nI’ll say again, they may be—they may be less than, than people estimate or more than people\nestimate. They’re not going to be zero. Consumers will pay some of this. Businesses will pay\nsome of this. Retailers will pay some of this. But, you know, we’re just going to have to, to see\nit through.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. And just a follow-up, if I could. Some additional tariffs have\nbeen in place since February, and things, you know, really haven’t broken yet with the economy.\nSo how, how do you justify to somebody who’s looking for a house, who’s facing a 7 percent\nmortgage and maybe can’t afford those rates? How do you justify that?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, so the housing—the housing is a—is a special case. Right?\nOur—we don’t set—we don’t set mortgage rates at the Fed, right? We set an overnight rate, and\nthe rates that go into mortgages are longer-term rates, like Treasury rates—it might be 30-year\nrates, it might be shorter than that, but it’s not the overnight Fed’s rate. It’s not that we don’t\nhave any effect. We do have an effect, but we’re not the main effect. There are other things\ngo—though, going on in the housing sector. And one of those is just, there’s kind of a long-term\nhousing shortage that we have. We haven’t built enough housing. This is not something the Fed\ncan help with, but then that’ll be the case even after things normalize. So I, I think the best thing\nthat we can do for housing is to have 2 percent inflation and maximum employment. And that’s\nthe—that’s what we can contribute to housing. There are lots of other jobs to do for the private\nsector and Congress, but that’s what we’re trying to get to. And, I mean, we’ve made a lot of\nprogress toward that. We’re in—we have a very good labor market right now. Inflation—we\nwere very close to 2 percent. We’re seeing some goods inflation move us away but, so far, not\nvery far away.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Chris.\nPage 15 of 24\nJuly 30, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you. Well, can you give us a\nlittle more about, what kind of economic data does the Fed need to see before you’ll be ready to\ncut? I mean, do you need inflation back nearly to target? Are there other things in the pricing\nthat you look for? Do you need to see weakening in the job market? What kind of things are\nyou looking for?\nCHAIR POWELL. I mean, ultimately, it’s—it could be any—it could be any of those\nthings. Right? But, but, you know, if you saw that the risks to the two goals were moving into\nbalance, if they were fully in balance, that would imply that you should move toward a more—a\nmore neutral stance of policy. This is—this is the special situation we’re in, which is, we have\ntwo-sided risk, risk to both of our goals. When we paused, inflation was above target, and the\nlabor market was pretty good. So, so, you know, that was a time when policy—policy was\nrestrictive when we paused. And to be restrictive is to be—to be supporting a return to our\ninflation target, right? So as the two targets get back into balance, you would—you would think\nyou’d move in, in, in a way closer to neutral and that the next—the next steps that we take are\nlikely to be in that direction. What will it take? You know, it’ll just take—it’ll be the totality of\nthe evidence. As I mentioned, there’s quite a lot of data coming in, which, before the next\nmeeting, will it be dispositive of that? I—you know, it’s really hard to say. We don’t make\nthose decisions right now. So we’ll have to see.\nCHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Well, I guess just in terms of inflation, though, for\nexample, like, will, will you—some people would point to, if it remains only in goods and it\ndoesn’t bleed over to services, then maybe that’s evidence that the tariff effect is going to be a\ntemporary, one-time thing. Is that kind of thing affect your thinking, or do you just need to see\nthe number come down—closer to 2?\nPage 16 of 24\nJuly 30, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. I think—we’ll, we’ll, we’ll look at everything. You know, it’s—as I\nmentioned, you know, a pretty reasonable base case is that this will be a one-time price increase.\nAnd, in the end, we’ll make sure that that’s the case. We’re just trying to do that efficiently.\nWe’re—and “efficiently” means getting the timing right so we don’t—again, if we go—if we cut\nrates too soon, maybe we didn’t finish the job with inflation. There’s—history is dotted with\nexamples of that. If you cut too late, then maybe you’re doing unnecessary damage to the labor\nmarket. So we’re trying to—we’re trying to get that timing right, and that’s effectively what\nwe’re doing.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Claire.\nCLAIRE JONES. Claire Jones, Financial Times. Just a question on the dollar. We’ve\nseen it decline quite heavily this year. I was wondering if there’s been any discussion about that\nat the meetings and how—to what degree that might be complicating your attempts to get\ninflation back to target. Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. So this goes back to the division of labor between the Fed and the\nTreasury—as you, I’m sure, know—and, you know, the, the, the Treasury only speaks to the—\nspeaks to the dollar. It’s not—it’s not something that’s been a topic of, of, you know, major\ndiscussion at all at, at—at the—at the Fed. I won’t say it doesn’t come up. The [FOMC\nmeeting] transcripts, when they come out in a few years—they’ll probably reflect some mentions\nof the dollar. But it would never be a, a major focus.\nCLAIRE JONES. And just to follow on, if I may, to Andrew’s question, I think the\namount of imputed data in CPI now is up to 35 percent. I mean, is there any discussion of that as\nwell? Is there any consideration of looking at—into alternative measures, data scraping and so\nPage 17 of 24\nJuly 30, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\non, in order to just ensure you’ve got a good read on what’s happening to prices in the U.S.\neconomy? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah, we’re—so we’re monitoring the situation. We do, of course—\nI mean, as you know, during the pandemic, we looked at a whole lot of new kinds of data.\nPeople are looking at big data sets that you can get from all sorts of places. And we do all of\nthat. But at the same—we really need—the government data really is the gold standard in data,\nand we need it to be—you know, to be good and be able to rely on it. And we’re not going to be\nable to substitute for that. But if—we have to make do with what we have, but I certainly hope\nthat we get what we need.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jay O’Brien.\nJAY O’BRIEN. Hi, Mr. Chairman. Jay O’Brien, ABC News. President Trump has\nobviously invoked your name a lot. He has personally pressured you. Are you concerned the\nway that conduct might impact the Fed’s independence going forward?\nCHAIR POWELL. I’ll just say that—so I, I think that having an independent central\nbank has been an institutional arrangement that has served the public well. And as long as it\nserves the public well, it should continue and be respected. If it didn’t serve the public well,\nthen, then it wouldn’t be something that we should just automatically defend. But what it gives\nus and other central banks—what it gives you is the ability to make these, these very challenging\ndecisions that—in ways that are focused on the data and the evolving outlook, the balance of\nrisks, and all the things we talk about, and not political factors. And so governments all over the\nadvanced-economy world have chosen to put a little bit of distance between direct political\ncontrol of those decisions and the decisionmakers. So if you—if you were—if you weren’t—if\nyou were not to have that, that would be a great temptation, of course, to, to use interest rates to\nPage 18 of 24\nJuly 30, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\naffect elections, for example. And that’s something that, that we don’t want to do. So I think\nthat’s pretty widely understood. Certainly, it is in Congress. And, I mean—I mean, I think it’s\nvery important. I’ll just say that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Maria Eloisa.\nMARIA ELOISA CAPURRO. Afternoon, Chair Powell. Maria Eloisa Capurro from\nBloomberg News. You mentioned a slowdown in consumer spending, and I wanted to see if you\ncould “walk us through” what was the discussion with the Committee around that. We’ve seen\ndelinquency rates rising for upper-income households. How do you see that evolving in the next\nfew months, and how much of a vulnerability that is for the economy going forward?\nCHAIR POWELL. Consumer spending had been very, very strong for the last couple of\nyears and had—repeatedly, forecasters, not just us, had been forecasting it would slow down.\nAnd now maybe it finally has. So I would say, you know, if you talk to credit card companies,\nfor example, they will tell you that the consumer is in solid shape and that spending is at a\nhealthy level. It’s not growing rapidly, but it’s at a healthy level. And delinquencies are not, not\na problem. You mentioned high-end delinquencies. I don’t know what to make of that. I read\nthe same thing. But—so, generally—and if you look at the banks and when the banks talk about\nin their earnings calls, their—the performance of credit has been good. So, essentially, you, you\nhave a consumer that’s in good shape and is spending, not at a rapid rate. But it, it, it’s true.\nAnd it was, again, right in line with what we expected, the GDP data that we got this week.\nSo—and I think it’s still a little bit difficult to interpret, because you have these massive swings\nin net exports, which, which may also be affecting—you know, some of that can be affected\nby—can affect consumer spending as well. Look, we—it’s one of the data points that we pay\nmost careful attention to, and there’s no question that it’s slowed. And, you know, we’re\nPage 19 of 24\nJuly 30, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nwatching it closely. But we also watch the labor market and the performance of inflation. Those\nare our two—those are our two variables that we’re assigned to maximize.\nMARIA ELOISA CAPURRO. And just to follow up on what my colleagues were asking\nabout the dissents: Governor Waller said that the labor market is on edge, and he was pointing to\nweaknesses on the private sector. I was wondering, you’ve said that the main number to look at\nis the unemployment number overall, but what was the discussion about the state of the private\njobs market?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I’m not going to talk about any individual’s—you know, any\nindividual’s comments. I wouldn’t do that. But, look, I think what we know is that private-\nsector job creation, you know, certainly in the last report—we’ll see on Friday—but had come\ndown a bit. And, and if you—if you take the QCEW adjustment seriously, with it—it may be\neven low—maybe close to zero. But the unemployment rate is still—was still low. So, what\nthat’s telling you is that, that, you know, demand for workers is slowing, but so is the supply. So\nthat’s a—it’s in balance, oddly enough. You’ve got a very low unemployment rate, and it’s kind\nof been there for a year as job creation has moved down, but also we know that, you know,\nbecause of immigration policy really, the flow into our labor forces is just a great deal slower.\nAnd those two things have slowed more or less in tandem. If you look at things, like I\nmentioned, quits, look at wages—wages are gradually cooling—look at vacancies to\nunemployment, those things have been pretty stable for—they haven’t really moved a lot in a full\nyear. So I think if you take the totality of the labor market data, you’ve got a solid labor market.\nBut I think you have to see that there are downside risks. It’s not—you don’t see weakening in\nthe labor market, but I think you’ve got downside risks in a world where unemployment’s being\nPage 20 of 24\nJuly 30, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nheld down because both demand and supply are declining. I think that’s—it’s worth paying\nclose attention to it, and we are.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nancy.\nNANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Hi, Chair Powell. Nancy Marshall-Genzer with\nMarketplace. One more question on the lack of unanimity in today’s decision, the two dissents.\nWas there talk during the meeting? I know you’re not going to talk about what—exactly what\nindividuals said, but, in general, was there talk during the meeting of cutting rates, and what was\nthe case against that at the meeting?\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So, you know, we have—we have an economic go-round,\nwhere people talk about the economy, and then the next—to—then to—that’s yesterday. And\nthen today, we have a monetary policy go-round, all the way around the table—everyone gives\ntheir views. So the discussion around policy was—the majority view was, was still what it has\nbeen, which is that inflation is running above target, maximum employment is right at target.\nThat means policy, policy should be a little bit restrictive, somewhat restrictive, because we\nwant—we want inflation to, to move all the way back to its target. So that’s where people have\nbeen and still are. Two of our members felt that the time had come to cut and that they—for the\nreasons that they’re—they’re going to express. I won’t tell you the reasons. They—they’ll issue\nsome kind of a—of a thing in the next day or so. So—but that’s the story. And I would say, you\nknow, well argued, very thoughtfully argued all around the table, good arguments. And, you\nknow, it’s a situation where—an unusual situation. The economy is in—is in, you know, good\nshape, but it’s an unusual situation where you have risks to both your employment mandate and\nyour inflation. That’s the nature of a supply shock. And it’s probably not surprising that there\nwould be differences and different perspectives on that as well as different views of where the\nPage 21 of 24\nJuly 30, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nneutral rate is, so they—different views of how tight policy is. So we have those. I will say,\nwhat you hope is that people, you know, explain their, their positions very thoughtfully and\nclearly. And we absolutely had that today all the way around the table. I would call it one of the\nbetter meetings I can recall from that standpoint.\nNANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. And you’ve said you’re waiting to be confident\ninflation is heading toward your 2 percent target before you start cutting rates. When you do get\nthat confidence, would you be in—would you be in favor of lowering rates right away?\nCHAIR POWELL. It’s not, not quite the way I would put it. You know, I said that’s\nwhy we think policy should, should be restrictive, is because, you know, inflation is above target.\nWhen we—when we have risks to both goals—one of them is farther away from goal than the\nother, and that’s inflation. Maximum employment’s at goal. So you have to—that means policy\nshould be tight because tight policy is what brings inflation down. If you came to the view that\nthe risks to the two were more in balance, that would imply that policy shouldn’t be restrictive, it\nshould be more neutral—more, more, you know, a neutral stance. And that would be somewhat\nlower than where we are now. No one knows exactly where that is. So that’s—that’s the\nframework I think I’d be taking. And, you know, we’ll just have to see. We’re going to be\nobviously looking at a lot of data in the next cycle. It is one of the cycles where we have two\nemployment and two inflation reports, and we’ll see where that takes us.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jeff Cox.\nJEFF COX. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking the question. Jeff Cox from\nCNBC.com. A metric that you like to cite a lot is the final sales to private domestic purchasers.\nThat was down to a 1.2 percent gain in the second quarter from 1.9 percent in Q1, suggesting\nthat there’s some softening in underlying demand. Just wondering if you look at that and you\nPage 22 of 24\nJuly 30, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ncombine that with some of the housing numbers that—with the weakness that you acknowledge\nat the top of your remarks—that the housing market is, in fact, weak. And the inflation numbers\nfrom GDP today came down 2.1 percent for headline, 2.5 percent for core. I’m wondering how\nmuch more movement you would need to see from these data points before you would be\ncomfortable with cutting in, say, September.\nCHAIR POWELL. It’s going to be the total—hard to answer that specifically. PDFP, I\nthink, for the first half—private domestic final purchases, or final sales, as people call it—was\n1.6 on the first half. GDP, I believe, was 1.2 percent. So that’s the whole half. You mentioned\nthe quarters. So those are slower. But, you know, GDP is bumpy quarter to quarter, half to half,\nand often gets revised, you know, after the fact. The labor market data, we, we still think, is—\ncontinue to think, is the best data we have on the economy. And that shows a 4.1 percent\nunemployment rate. It shows wages, you know, still at a healthy level, but moving ever closer to\nwhat we would regard as long-run sustainable, consistent with longer-run productivity and\n2 percent inflation. So the labor market is actually still quite solid. Inflation is above target.\nEven ignoring tariffs, it’s a little bit above target. And tariffs—so we’re watching all of that and,\nagain, trying to—trying to do the right thing in what is a challenging situation, because you’re\nbeing pulled in two directions and you have to decide which of those it took to go in. And,\nactually, at some point, if they’re—if they’re sort of equally at risk, then you really want to be at\na neutral policy stance, which we’re not right now.\nJEFF COX. So it’d be safe to say that, if the data kind of stays in line with where it is\nright now, that you wouldn’t be comfortable with cutting in September?\nCHAIR POWELL. I’m not going to—I’m not going to say that. No. I, I, I just think\nwe’re going to need to see the data, and it can go in many different directions—the inflation data\nPage 23 of 24\nJuly 30, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nand, and the employment data. And we’ll just—we’re going to make a judgment based on all of\nthe data and based on that balance-of-risks analysis that I mentioned.\nJEFF COX. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Greg Robb, for the last question.\nGREG ROBB. Thanks, Chair Powell. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. The Treasury\nSecretary has said recently that it would be confusing for the markets if you stayed on as a\nGovernor after your term on the—as Chair ends. And I was wondering if you had any update for\nus on—a decision on that front.\nCHAIR POWELL. Sorry, I do not have any update for you. Thanks very much,\neveryone.\nPage 24 of 24"

    "statement": "For release at 2:00 p.m. EDT September 17, 2025\nRecent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity moderated in the first half of\nthe year. Job gains have slowed, and the unemployment rate has edged up but remains low.\nInflation has moved up and remains somewhat elevated.\nThe Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of\n2 percent over the longer run. Uncertainty about the economic outlook remains elevated. The\nCommittee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that downside\nrisks to employment have risen.\nIn support of its goals and in light of the shift in the balance of risks, the Committee\ndecided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 4 to\n4-1/4 percent. In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate,\nthe Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of\nrisks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt\nand agency mortgage‑backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting\nmaximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.\nIn assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to\nmonitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee\nwould be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that\ncould impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take\ninto account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions,\n(more)\n-2-\ninflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.\nVoting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H.

    "press_conf": "September 17, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nTranscript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference\nSeptember 17, 2025\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on\nachieving our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of\nthe American people. While the unemployment rate remains low, it has edged up, job gains have\nslowed, and downside risks to employment have risen. At the same time, inflation has risen\nrecently and remains somewhat elevated.\nIn support of our goals, and in light of the shift in the balance of risks, today the Federal\nOpen Market Committee decided to lower our policy interest rate by ¼ percentage point. We\nalso decided to continue to reduce our securities holdings. I’ll have more to say about monetary\npolicy after briefly reviewing economic developments.\nRecent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity has moderated. GDP rose at a\npace of around 1½ percent in the first half of the year, down from 2.5 percent last year. The\nmoderation in growth largely reflects a slowdown in consumer spending. In contrast, business\ninvestment in equipment and intangibles has picked up from last year’s pace. Activity in the\nhousing sector remains weak. In our Summary of Economic Projections, the median participant\nprojects GDP to rise 1.6 percent this year and 1.8 percent next year, a touch stronger than\nprojected in June.\nIn the labor market, the unemployment rate edged up to 4.3 percent in August but\nremains little changed over the past year at a relatively low level. Payroll job gains have slowed\nsignificantly to a pace of just 29,000 per month over the past three months. A good part of the\nslowing likely reflects a decline in the growth of the labor force due to lower immigration and\nlower labor force participation. Even so, labor demand has softened, and the recent pace of job\nPage 1 of 26\nSeptember 17, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ncreation appears to be running below the “breakeven” rate needed to hold the unemployment rate\nconstant. In addition, wage growth has continued to moderate, while still outpacing inflation.\nOverall, the marked slowing in both the supply of and demand for workers is unusual. In\nthis less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment appear to\nhave risen. In our SEP, the median projection for the unemployment rate is 4.5 percent at the\nend of this year and edges down thereafter.\nInflation has eased significantly from its highs in mid-2022 but remains somewhat\nelevated relative to our 2 percent longer-run goal. Estimates based on the consumer price index\nand other data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.7 percent over the 12 months ending in\nAugust and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose\n2.9 percent. These readings are higher than earlier in the year, as inflation for goods has picked\nup. In contrast, disinflation appears to be continuing for services. Near-term measures of\ninflation expectations have moved up, on balance, over the course of this year on news about\ntariffs, as reflected in both market- and survey-based measures. Beyond the next year or so,\nhowever, most measures of longer-term expectations remain consistent with our 2 percent\ninflation goal. The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 3.0 percent this year\nand falls to 2.6 percent in 2026 and to 2.1 percent in 2027.\nOur monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people. At today’s meeting, the Committee\ndecided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point to 4 to\n4¼ percent and to continue reducing the size of our balance sheet.\nChanges to government policies continue to evolve, and their effects on the economy\nremain uncertain. Higher tariffs have begun to push up prices in some categories of goods, but\nPage 2 of 26\nSeptember 17, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ntheir overall effects on economic activity and inflation remain to be seen. A reasonable base\ncase is that the effects on inflation will be relatively short lived—a one-time shift in the price\nlevel. But it is also possible that the inflationary effects could instead be more persistent, and\nthat is a risk to be assessed and managed. Our obligation is to ensure that a one-time increase in\nthe price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem.\nIn the near term, risks to inflation are tilted to the upside and risks to employment to the\ndownside—a challenging situation. When our goals are in tension like this, our framework calls\nfor us to balance both sides of our dual mandate. With downside risks to employment having\nincreased, the balance of risks has shifted. Accordingly, we judged it appropriate at this meeting\nto take another step toward a more neutral policy stance.\nWith today’s decision, we remain well positioned to respond in a timely way to potential\neconomic developments. We will continue to determine the appropriate stance of monetary\npolicy based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.\nIn our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an\nappropriate path for the federal funds rate, based on what each participant judges to be the most\nlikely scenario for the economy. The median participant projects that the appropriate level of the\nfederal funds rate will be 3.6 percent at the end of this year, 3.4 percent at the end of 2026, and\n3.1 percent at the end of 2027. This path is ¼ percentage point lower than projected in June. As\nis always the case, these individual forecasts are subject to uncertainty, and they are not a\nCommittee plan or decision. Policy is not on a preset course.\nThe Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy—maximum employment and\nstable prices. We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation\nsustainably to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.\nPage 3 of 26\nSeptember 17, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nOur success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans. We understand that our\nactions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in\nservice to our public mission, and we at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our\nmaximum-employment and price-stability goals.\nThank you. I look forward to our discussion.\nCHRIS RUGABER. Great. Thank you. Chris Rugaber at Associated Press. As you\nknow, Fed Governor Stephen Miran has continued—kept his position at the White House even\nas he’s joined the Fed Board. This is the first time, I believe, the Fed’s Board has had someone\nwith executive-branch ties in decades. Does this compromise the Fed’s independence from day-\nto-day politics? And, relatedly, how can you maintain the public’s perception the Fed is\npolitically independent with this dynamic? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So we did welcome a new Committee member today, as we always\ndo, and the Committee remains united in pursuing our dual-mandate goals. We’re strongly\ncommitted to maintaining our independence, and beyond that I really don’t have anything to\nshare.\nCHRIS RUGABER. And then just as a quick follow-up—I’m sorry. Can you—you and\nother Fed officials have spoken extensively about the impact of tariffs on inflation, although,\nperhaps, with many companies appearing to “eat” the tariffs, tariffs may be impacting the labor\nmarket and other parts of the economy instead. Do you see that as a possible outcome here—that\ntariffs are the reason we’re seeing some slowing, particularly in the labor market? Rather than in\ninflation? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, it’s certainly possible. You know, we’re beginning to\nsee—we have begun to see [increased] goods prices showing through into higher inflation. And,\nPage 4 of 26\nSeptember 17, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nactually, the increase in goods prices accounts for most of the increase in inflation or, perhaps,\nall of the increase in inflation over the course of this year. Those are not very large effects at this\npoint. And we do expect them to continue to build over the course of the rest of the year and into\nnext year.\nAnd it’s also possible that there may be effects on employment. But I would say, if\nyou’re looking at why employment is doing what it’s doing, that’s much more about the change\nin immigration. So the supply of workers has, obviously, come way down. There’s very little\ngrowth, if any, in the supply of workers. And at the same time, demand for workers has also\ncome down quite sharply and to the point where we see what I’ve called a “curious balance.”\nTypically, when we say things are “in balance,” that sounds good. But, in this case, the balance\nis because both supply and demand have come down quite sharply, now demand coming down a\nlittle more sharply because we see—we now see the unemployment rate edging up.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos with the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, do\neconomic conditions and the balance of risks no longer warrant a restrictive policy setting?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I don’t think we can say that. What we can say is this: that over\nthe course of this year, we’ve kept our policy at a restrictive level—and people have different\nviews, but a clearly restrictive level, I would say. And we were able to do that over the course of\nthis year because the labor market was in very solid condition, with strong job creation and all\nthose things.\nI think if you go back to April and now look at the revised job-creation numbers for May,\nJune, July, and August, you can kind of—I can no longer say that. So what that means is that the\nrisks, which—the risks were clearly tilted toward inflation. I would say they’re moving toward\nequality. Maybe they’re not quite at equality—we don’t need to know that. But we do know\nPage 5 of 26\nSeptember 17, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthat they’ve moved meaningfully toward greater equality—the risks between the two goals—and\nthat suggests that we should be moving in the direction of neutral. And that’s what we did today.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Under what circumstances would a larger than 25 basis points rate\ncut be warranted? And how seriously was that option entertained at your meeting this week?\nCHAIR POWELL. There wasn’t widespread support at all for a 50 basis point cut today.\nYou know, I think we’ve done—we’ve done very large rate hikes and very large rate cuts in the\nlast five years, and you tend to do those at a time when you feel that policy is out of place and\nneeds to move quickly to a new place. That’s not at all what I feel, certainly now. I feel like our\npolicy has been doing the right thing so far this year. I think we were right to wait and see how\ntariffs and inflation and the labor market evolved. I think we’re now reacting to the much lower\nlevel of job creation and other evidence of softening in the labor market and saying, well, those\nrisks are maybe not fully balanced but moving in the direction of balance now, and so that\nwarrants a change in policy.\nCOLBY SMITH. Colby Smith with the New York Times. Should we be viewing today’s\ncut as the Committee taking out some insurance against the possibility that the labor market is at\nrisk of weakening, or is it the Committee’s view that the dynamics of a downturn are already in\nplace? I guess I’m just, you know, trying to square the shift in the rate forecast in the SEP\ntowards more cuts than just three months ago with the fact that the forecast for unemployment\ndidn’t change.\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah, I think you could think of this, in a way, as a risk-management\ncut, because if you look at the SEP, actually the projections for growth this year and next\nactually ticked up just a little bit and inflation and unemployment didn’t really move.\nPage 6 of 26\nSeptember 17, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nSo what’s different now? What’s different now is that you see a very different picture of\nthe risks to the labor market. You’ve seen—you know, we were looking at 150,000 jobs a month\nat the time of the last meeting, and now we see the revisions and we see the new numbers. And I\ndidn’t—I don’t want to put too much emphasis on payroll job creation, but it’s just one of the\nthings that suggests that the labor market is really cooling off. And that tells you that it’s time to\ntake that into account in our, you know, in our policy.\nCOLBY SMITH. So just looking at the SEP once again, the median participant has\ninflation higher than previously expected by the end of next year and the Fed not getting back to\nthe 2 percent target until 2028. So I guess I’m just wondering how you characterize the risk to\nprice pressures of kicking off a series of cuts at this point.\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah, so I would look at it this way. We fully understand and\nappreciate that we need to remain fully committed to restoring 2 percent inflation on a sustained\nbasis, and we will do that. At the same time, we’ve got to weigh the risks to the two goals. And\nI would say since—really, since April, to me the risks of higher and more persistent inflation\nhave probably become a little less. And that’s partly because the labor market has softened,\nGDP growth has slowed. And so I would just say that the risks there have been less than one\nmight think. And in terms of the labor market, what we’re seeing is, unemployment is still\nlow—it’s still at a relatively low rate, but we’re seeing downside risks.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television. I’m a\nlittle confused by your explanation of the Fed cutting rates because of unemployment if you\nthink that most of what’s happening in the employment area is related to immigration, which\nyour rate cuts wouldn’t address. How do you see that as more important than inflation, which\nhas remained almost a full percentage point above your target?\nPage 7 of 26\nSeptember 17, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, I was—I was saying that what’s happening in the labor market\nhas more to do with immigration than it has to do with tariffs. That was the question I was\nanswering. So I wouldn’t say that all of what’s happening in the labor market is due to tariffs. I\nmean, you clearly have a slowing due to immigration. You clearly have a slowing in demand,\nwhich is now perhaps more than that in supply. And we know that because the unemployment\nrate has ticked up. So that’s how—that’s what I meant by that.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. If I could follow up: Every year since 2015, the SEP has forecast\nthat you would hit your target two years later. And this year, this SEP says you’re going to hit\nyour target two years later. Two percent does not seem to be in sight. Does that suggest that the\n2 percent target is not really achievable? And does this present any credibility problems for you\nin telling people that that’s what you’re going to do, if you can never reach it?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, I mean, you’re right. It does say we’re going to get to\n2 percent inflation in 2028—at the end of ’28. But that’s—you know, that’s literally how you\nput the projections together. You’re writing down a rate path which is designed to create, over\nthe course of the SEP, you know, time frame, 2 percent inflation, and maximum employment\ntoo. So that’s, that’s all that is. You know, we don’t—no one really knows where the economy\nwill be in three years, but the nature of the exercise is to write down policy that you believe\nwould return to the 2 percent goal over the—at least by the end of the exercise.\nELIZABETH SCHULZE. Thanks so much. Elizabeth Schulze with ABC News. The\nlatest inflation report shows that prices are still going up across key categories for many\nhouseholds, including groceries. What will the Fed do if prices pick up more?\nCHAIR POWELL. So our expectation, and you can see this consistently through the\nyear, has been that inflation will move up this year, but that the—basically, because of the effects\nPage 8 of 26\nSeptember 17, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\non goods prices from tariffs—but that those will turn out to be a one-time price increase, as\nopposed to creating an inflationary process. That’s been our forecast. Pretty much every—all\nthe individual forecasts say that. We can’t just assume that, though, right? We have to—our job\nis literally to make sure that that is what happens. And we will do that job.\nRight now, the situation we’re in is that we see inflation—we continue to expect it to\nmove up. Maybe not as high as we would have expected it to move up a few months ago. The\npass-through into—of the tariffs into inflation has been slower and smaller. The labor market\nhas softened. So the case for there being a persistent inflation outbreak is less. And so that’s\nwhy we think it’s time for us really to acknowledge that the risks to the other mandate have\ngrown, and that we should move in the direction of neutral.\nSo what will we do? We’ll do what we need to do. But we have two mandates, and we\ntry to balance them. For a long time, our framework says that when our two goals are in\ntension—this is quite an unusual situation. How do we decide what to do? Because our tools\ncan’t do two things at once. What we do is we ask, which is farther from—how far is each from\nthe goal, and how long is it expected to get to the goal? So and then that’s—we think about\nthose things, and we see—as I mentioned, we have been—our policy had been really skewed\ntoward inflation for a long time, really. Now we see that there’s downside risk clearly in the\nlabor market. And so we’re moving in a direction of more neutral policy.\nELIZABETH SCHULZE. How concerned are you about the slowdown in the jobs\nmarket for households at home, especially younger Americans struggling to land a job?\nCHAIR POWELL. So it’s an interesting labor market. And obviously we think it’s\nappropriate that we reduce our rates so that we become more neutral, which will be—which,\npresumably, will be better for the labor market. You see people who are sort of more at the\nPage 9 of 26\nSeptember 17, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nmargins—so kids coming out of college and younger people, minorities—are having a hard time\nfinding jobs. The overall job-finding rate is very, very low. However, the layoff rate is also very\nlow. So you’ve got a low—a low-firing, low-hiring environment. And the concern is that if you\nstart to see layoffs, the people who are laid off won’t—there won’t be a lot of hiring going on.\nSo that could very quickly flow into higher unemployment. In a healthier economy, healthier\nlabor market, there would be jobs for those people. But now the hiring rate is very, very low. So\nthat’s been a growing concern over the last few months, and it’s one of the reasons why we think\nit’s appropriate that we begin to shift our policy focus toward a more balanced one.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Mr. Chair, in the past during rate cuts you\nused the word “recalibration.” And I wonder if you pointedly did not use it this time. And, in\nfact, when you said “policy is not on a preset course,” did you mean that as sort of the opposite\nof recalibration? Are we meeting to meeting, data point by data point? Are we in the process\nhere of getting back to neutral? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think we are—we’re in a meeting-by-meeting situation, and\nwe’re going to be looking at the data. You know, let me say a word about the SEP, really, here.\nSo we often point this out. What the SEP is, it’s an accumulation—a cumulation of the\nindividual projections of 19 people showing what they believe at a particular moment in time to\nbe the most likely path for the economy and, thus, the appropriate path for monetary policy as\nwell. And as you know, we don’t—we don’t debate or try to agree on what that is; we just write\nthem down and cumulate them. We do sometimes discuss them. And so we always say we’re\nnot on a preset path, and we really mean that. The actual decisions we make are going to be\nbased on the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks at the time the\ndecisions are actually made.\nPage 10 of 26\nSeptember 17, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nSo you will have seen that we have 10 participants out of 19 who wrote down two or\nmore cuts for the remainder of the year, and 9 who wrote down fewer than—in fact, in a good\nnumber of cases no more cuts. So rather than looking at—so rather than looking at this as\ncertainty, I would encourage people, as always, to look at the SEP as—through the lens of\nprobability. And so there are—there are different possible outcomes and likelihoods rather than\n“this one is certain, and this one isn’t happening.” So that’s what I would say.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Thank you for getting to my follow-up question, which was, is the\ndispersion in the outlook a sign of uncertainty of policy in the—in the meetings to come? Thank\nyou.\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, it is such an unusual situation. Ordinarily, when the\nlabor market is weak, inflation is low; and when the labor market is really strong, that’s when\nyou’ve got to be careful about inflation. So we have a situation where we have two-sided risk,\nand that means there’s no risk-free path. And so it’s quite a difficult situation for policymakers.\nAnd it’s not at all surprising to me that you have a range of views. It’s not so much about having\ndifferent views for the path of the economy, but—it’s partly that, but it’s also partly about what’s\nthe right thing to do in light of this—of the tension between the two goals. How do you weight\nthem? How worried are you about one versus the other? And so it’s natural. I think it would\nactually be surprising if you didn’t have a pretty wide range of views based, you know, in this\nkind of highly unusual situation, and we do.\nBut, you know, we get together, we discuss—we have a great discussion, and then we\ndecide what to do and we act. But you’re right that it is—it’s a wide dispersion of views, and I\nthink that’s understandable and natural in the current situation.\nPage 11 of 26\nSeptember 17, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi. Victoria Guida with Politico. You’ve talked a lot about Fed\nindependence and the importance of it over the years, but as markets have questions about what\nexactly President Trump’s intentions are with the Fed, what would you point to as the things they\nshould be watching to determine that the Fed is still making decisions based on, you know, the\neconomic outlook rather than political considerations?\nCHAIR POWELL. Look, it’s deeply in our culture to do—to do our work based on the\nincoming data and never consider anything else. That’s just—everybody here who’s at the Fed\nreally feels strongly about that way. So, you know, you’ll know it by the way we talk about what\nwe’re doing, by the speeches that people give, by the decisions that we make. You’ll know that\nwe’re just still going to do that. That’s all we do. And we don’t—we don’t frame these\nquestions at all or see them in terms of political outcomes. I think when you get to another part\nof Washington, everything is seen through the lens of, does it help or hurt this political party, this\npolitician? You know, that’s the framework. And I think people find it hard to believe that\nthat’s just—that is not at all the way we think about things at the Fed. We’re taking a longer\nperspective. We’re trying to, you know, serve the American people as best we can. So I think—\nI think you would be able to tell. I don’t—I don’t believe we’ll ever get to that place. You\nknow, I would say we’re doing our work exactly as we always have now, and people are—\nthey’re making their arguments, and we’re having, really, a great discussion around these\nchallenging issues. So—\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Do you see the court case around Lisa Cook as being related to\nquestions of Fed independence?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, I see it as a court case that it would be inappropriate for\nme to comment on.\nPage 12 of 26\nSeptember 17, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Edward Lawrence from Fox\nBusiness. So we saw the preliminary benchmark revisions, down 911,000. The revisions for\nJune were the first negative revisions we’ve seen since December of 2020. You know, how can\nthe Fed base important decisions on rate and what to do with the interest—with the interest rates\non data that seems to be, as you’ve called it in the past, noisy?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, on the QCEW, the revision that we saw was almost exactly what\nwe expected. It was amazing how close the expectation was. And the reason for that is for the\nlast bunch of quarters, there’s been a—almost a predictable overcount. And I think the, you\nknow, the Bureau of Labor Statistics really does understand this, and they’re working hard to fix\nit. It’s got to do—of course, it has something to do with low response rates. But it’s also got to\ndo with what’s called the birth–death model, because a good amount of job creation happens\naround new companies, and how many go out of business, how many are founded. And it’s just\nreally hard. You can’t survey for that. You’ve got to have a model that predicts that. And it’s\nquite difficult to do, especially when the economy is undergoing big changes. And they’ve been\nworking on that and are making progress on it. But, you know, the data we get is still well good\nenough for us to do our work. To the extent we have issues around data right now, it’s about low\nresponse rates. That’s happened all over—all over, really. Response rates are just lower to\nsurveys now, both in and out of the government. And it’s no great secret. You know, we want\nhigher response rates, and we need those to have, you know, less volatile data. And the way to\nget that is to make sure that the agencies that collect the data have sufficient resources to drive\nhigher response rates. It’s not a complicated problem. But that’s what it takes. It’s not a\nmystery. That’s what it takes.\nPage 13 of 26\nSeptember 17, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nThe other thing I’ll say, Edward, is in the case of the job creation, the first—the response\nrate is quite low for the first month, or lower for the first month. By the time you get to the\nsecond or third month, you’re still collecting responses for that last month—for that prior month.\nAnd you get to the place where the data are much more reliable by the second, and certainly the\nthird, month. So it’s not that we don’t get the data—it’s just that we get it a little later.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. But if—well, for the benchmarks, if that holds, it’s 51 percent\nof the jobs that we thought were there weren’t really there. It shows a weaker market—job\nmarket coming into this year. If you would have had that information, would it have changed\nyour mind related to where the interest rates should be? Should there have been a cut earlier?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, we have to live life looking through the windshield rather\nthan the rearview mirror, as you know. And all I can tell you is we see where we are now, and\nwe take appropriate action. And we took that appropriate action today.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thanks. Howard Schneider with Reuters. So, as you\nmentioned a minute ago, some margins of the job market would suggest that the slide’s already\nhappening. The Black unemployment rate in August was above 7 percent, declining workweek,\ndifficulty among college graduates finding work, high—rising youth unemployment. Why do\nyou think a ¼ percentage point now is going to arrest that?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, I hadn’t say that I thought a ¼ point would make a huge\ndifference to the economy. But you’ve got to look at the whole path of rates, right? And the\nmarket has already—has already been baking in expectations. I mean, our market works through\nexpectations, right? So I think our policy path really does matter. And I think it’s important that\nwe use our tools to support the labor market when we do see signs like that. I did mention that,\nyou know, you see minority unemployment going up, you see younger people—people who are\nPage 14 of 26\nSeptember 17, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nmore vulnerable economically, more susceptible to economic cycles. That’s one of the reasons,\nin addition to just overall lower payroll job creation, that shows you that at the margin the labor\nmarket is weakening. I would also point to labor force participation. Some part of the\nsignificant decline in labor force participation over the last year has probably been cyclical in\nnature, rather than just the usual aging process.\nSo we put all those together, and we see that the labor market is softening, and we don’t\nneed it to soften any more, don’t want it to. So we use our tools. And, you know, it starts with a\n25 basis point rate cut, but we—you know, the market’s also pricing in a rate path. I’m not\nblessing what the market’s doing at all. I’m just saying it’s not just one action.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. As a follow-up to that: The growth mix right now seems very\nconcentrated in investment and, on the consumer spending side, in higher-income groups. Do\nyou feel that that’s an unsustainable mix for the economy, moving forward?\nCHAIR POWELL. I wouldn’t say that. I mean, you’re right. Those are two—we’re\ngetting unusually large amounts of economic activity through the AI build-out and corporate\ninvestment. I don’t know how long that will go on. No one does.\nIn terms of spending, you saw the consumer spending numbers were well above\nexpectations, and that may well be skewed toward higher-earning consumers. There’s a lot of\nanecdotal evidence to suggest that. Nonetheless, it’s spending. So, I mean, I think the economy\nis—you know, it’s moving along. Economic growth is going to be 1½ percent or better this year,\nmaybe a little better. Forecasts have been coming up, as you can see. So labor market is—\nunemployment is low, but—you know, downside risks—but it’s still a low unemployment rate.\nSo that’s how we see it.\nPage 15 of 26\nSeptember 17, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nSTEPHANIE RUHLE. Hi. Stephanie Ruhle, MSNBC. Treasury Secretary Scott\nBessent has said that the Federal Reserve suffers from “mission creep” and institutional bloat.\nHe’s now calling for an independent review. Would you support an independent review, or are\nyou open to any sort of reform in any areas of the Fed?\nCHAIR POWELL. I—of course, I’m not going to comment on anything the secretary\nsays or, really, any other officer says. So in terms of reform at the Fed, you know, we just—we\njust went through a lengthy and I think very successful process of updating our monetary policy\nframework. I would say there’s a lot of work going on behind the scenes around the assets we\nhave in the Federal Reserve System and at the Board. Are they the right size? We’re actually\ngoing through a 10 percent head count reduction through the whole Fed, including the Board and\nall the Reserve Banks. Employment at the Fed at the end of that will be basically at the same\nlevel it was more than 10 years ago. So we will have had zero job growth for more than a decade\nwhen we’re finished with that, and I think we’ll probably do more than that. So I think we’re\ncertainly open to constructive criticism and ways to do our jobs better.\nSTEPHANIE RUHLE. But not an independent review?\nCHAIR POWELL. We’re certainly open to, you know, to always trying to do better.\nNEIL IRWIN. Mr. Chairman, Neil Irwin with Axios. There’s been some debate lately\non whether AI is already starting to affect the labor market in terms of lower labor demand,\nhigher productivity by contrast. Do you buy that? And if that is true, does that have implications\nfor the monetary policy setting?\nCHAIR POWELL. So there’s great uncertainty around that. I think my view—which is\nalso a bit of a guess, but widely shared I think—is that you are seeing some effects, but it’s not\nthe main thing driving it. And so a particular focus on young people coming out of college and,\nPage 16 of 26\nSeptember 17, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nyeah, there may be something there. It may be that companies or other institutions that have\nbeen hiring younger people right out of college are able to use AI more than they had in the past.\nThat may be part of the story. It’s also part of the story, though, that, you know, job creation\nmore broadly has slowed down. The economy has slowed down. And so it’s probably a number\nof things. But, yeah, it’s probably a factor. Hard to say how big it is.\nANDREW ACKERMAN. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. What evidence do you see of tariffs\nshowing up in inflation?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, if you—you can take goods—just sort of the broad goods\ncategory, and last year goods inflation was negative. If you go back 25 years, that was the\ntypical thing was that goods inflation was—goods prices generally went down, even adjusting\nfor quality. So that was not the case during the pandemic, of course. Goods inflation went very\nhigh. But we had essentially returned to zero or slightly negative inflation. Now, I think goods\ninflation over the course of the past year is 1.2 percent, which doesn’t sound like a lot, but it’s a\nbig change. So we think—I mean, analysts have different views, but we think it’s contributing,\nyou know, 0.3 or 0.4, something like that, to the current core PCE inflation reading, which is\n2.9 percent. So it’s contributing.\nWhat seems to be happening is that, you know, the tariffs are not—mostly not being paid\nby exporters, mostly being paid by, really, the companies that sit between the exporter and the\nconsumer. So if you buy something and you sell it through retail or you use it to make a product,\nyou’re probably taking a lot of those costs on and not able to pass it fully along to the consumer\nyet. That appears to be what we’re seeing. All of those companies and entities in the middle,\nthey’ll tell you that they have every intention of passing that through in time, but they’re not\ndoing that now. To the consumer, the pass-through has been pretty small. It’s been slower and\nPage 17 of 26\nSeptember 17, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nlater—slower and smaller than we thought. But the evidence is very clear that there’s some\npass-through.\nANDREW ACKERMAN. I also wanted to ask if you could share with us the conditions\nunder which you might consider leaving the Fed in May.\nCHAIR POWELL. I have nothing new on that for you today.\nCATARINA SARAIVA. Hi. Catarina Saraiva with Bloomberg News. I just wanted to\nfollow up on, you know, one of your answers just a couple minutes ago. You know, we’ve often\nheard you talk about how you and your colleagues, you know, do not think about politics, this\ndoes not enter the room. But one of your new colleagues does come from this world, right,\nwhere everything is seen through this framework of politics, and of what party is being helped.\nAnd that person is still employed by the White House. How can markets and the public\ninterpret, you know, some of his speeches, for example, and then some of, you know, the\nforecast that we see today? I mean, the median for this year was moved because of the\nintroduction of his forecast. I’m talking about the number of rate cuts seen this year. What do\nyou, you know, what do you say to markets and the public that are trying to interpret, you know,\nwhat you guys are saying?\nCHAIR POWELL. So there’s 12 voters—19 participants, of whom 12 vote, as you\nknow, on a rotating basis. So no one voter, you know, can really—the only way for any voter to\nreally move things around is to be incredibly persuasive. And the only way to do that, in the\ncontext in which we work, is to make really strong arguments based on the data and one’s\nunderstanding of the economy. That’s really all that matters. And that’s how it’s going to work.\nAnd I think that is the way the institution—that’s in the DNA of the institution. That’s not going\nto change.\nPage 18 of 26\nSeptember 17, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCATARINA SARAIVA. And then I wanted to ask about a Gallup poll that showed that\nAmericans now have more confidence in the President than the Federal Reserve when it comes\nto doing what’s right for the economy. Why do you think that is? And what’s your response?\nWhat’s your message to the public?\nCHAIR POWELL. Our response is we’re going to do everything we can to use our tools\nto achieve the goals that Congress has given us. And we’re not going to get distracted by\nanything. So I think that’s what we’re going to do. We’re just going to keep doing our jobs.\nCLAIRE JONES. Claire Jones, Financial Times. Given the range of views expressed\nprior to the meeting, I think there was a lot less dissent today than a lot of people expected. It’d\nbe good to know just what you think the drivers were of coming to the very strong consensus in\nthe meeting. And also, on the flip side, to just explain why the dot plots are really so scattered\nbetween—you know, someone even expecting rates to end up higher by the end of the year, to\nfive cuts. I mean, what were the kind of range of views you had about, on one side, why there\nwas so much support for a cut today, and, on the flip side, why there’s so much divergence about\nwhat comes next?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I think there’s quite a wide assessment that the situation has\nchanged with respect to the labor market, whereas we could still say—and did say—in July, at\nthe time of the July meeting, that the labor market was in solid condition, and we could point to\n150,000 jobs per month, and many other things. I think that the new data that we’ve had—and\nit’s not just payrolls, it’s other things as well—suggests that there really is meaningful downside\nrisk. I said there was downside risk then, but I think that that downside risk is now a reality.\nAnd there’s clearly more downside risk.\nPage 19 of 26\nSeptember 17, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nSo I think that was—I think that’s broadly accepted. And so that meant different things\nfor different people. You know, some wrote down—almost everyone wrote down support of this\ncut. And some supported more cuts, and some didn’t, as you will see from the dot plot. So it’s\njust the way—that’s just the way it is. I mean, people have—you have people who take this\nwork very seriously, think about it all the time, do their work, discuss it with our colleagues.\nYou know, we endlessly discuss this between ourselves. And then we have a meeting where we\nput it all out on the table. And this is what you get.\nAnd you’re right, there is a—there’s a range of views in the dots. And I think that’s, like\nI said, very unsurprising given the quite unusual—historically unusual nature of the challenges\nthat we face. But let’s remember, though, the unemployment rate’s 4.3 percent. The economy is\ngrowing at 1½ percent. So it’s not a bad economy, or anything like that. We’ve seen much more\nchallenging economic times.\nBut from a policy standpoint, the standpoint of what we’re trying to accomplish, it’s\nchallenging to know what to do. There are, as I mentioned earlier, there are no risk-free paths\nnow. It’s not incredibly obvious what to do. So we have to keep our eye on inflation. At the\nsame time, we cannot ignore and must keep our eye on maximum employment, which is—those\nare our two equal goals. And you will see that there are just a range of views on what to do.\nNonetheless, we came together today at the meeting and acted with a high degree of unity.\nARCHIE HALL. Thank you. Archie Hall from the Economist. You mentioned earlier\nthat job creation is running below your guess at its breakeven rate. I’d be curious to hear a bit\nmore about that and where you think the breakeven rate is.\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, so there are many different ways to calculate it and none\nof them is perfect, but, you know, it’s clearly come way down. There are—you could say it’s\nPage 20 of 26\nSeptember 17, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nsomewhere between zero and 50,000, and you’d be right or wrong. I mean, there’s just many\ndifferent ways to do it. So wherever it was—150,000, 200,000 a few months ago—it’s come\ndown quite significantly. And that’s because a very—a lower amount of people are joining the\nlabor force. The labor force is really not growing much at this point. And that’s a lot of where\nthe supply of labor was coming from over the last three—two or three years, so we’re not getting\nthat now.\nWe’re also—we’ve gotten much lower demand. You know, it’s interesting that supply\nand demand have really come down together so far, except now we do have inflation—sorry,\nunemployment ticking up outside, just one tick outside of the range where it’s been for a year.\nFour point three percent is still a low level, but, you know, I think this level of—this speedy\ndecline in both supply and demand has certainly gotten everyone’s attention.\nARCHIE HALL. A follow-up, if I may. You mention the downside risk to employment\na fair amount, but it’s striking that measures of kind of activity and output for the third quarter,\nthose that we have, seem pretty strong. The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow is very strong. You\nmentioned strong PCE numbers as well. How do you square those things? Is there—is there a\nchance actually there could be upside risk to the labor market if those activity measures are\nright?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, that would be great. We’d love that to happen. So I don’t\nknow that you see a big tension there, but it’s gratifying to see that economic activity is holding\nand—you know, so it’s a good, a good bit from consumption. It looks like consumption was\nstronger than expected—what we got earlier this week, I guess. And also we’re getting, you\nknow—a fairly narrow sector is producing a lot of economic activity, which is the AI build-out\nand, you know, business investment.\nPage 21 of 26\nSeptember 17, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nSo, you know, we watch all of it. And I would say we—you know, we did move up, the\nmedian for growth for this year actually moved up in the SEP between the June and September\nSEPs, so—and, really, the inflation and labor market didn’t change much. It’s really the risks\nthat we’re seeing to the labor market that were the focus of today’s decision.\nNICOLE GOODKIND. Hi. Nicole Goodkind with Barron’s. Thank you for taking my\nquestion. Given the cumulative impact of high interest rates on the housing sector, I’m\nwondering how concerned you are that current rate levels are exacerbating housing affordability\nissues and potentially hindering household formation and wealth accumulation for a segment of\nthe population.\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, housing is an interest-sensitive activity, so it’s at the very\ncenter of monetary policy. When the pandemic hit and we cut rates to zero, the housing\ncompanies were incredibly grateful and it was really—they said that was the only thing that kept\nthem going was that we cut so aggressively and provided credit and things like that, and they\nwere able to finance because we did that.\nThe other side of that is when inflation gets high and we raise rates—and you’re right, it\ndoes burden the housing industry. And so rates have come down a bit, and as that happens we\ndon’t set the—we don’t set mortgage rates, but our policy rate changes do tend to affect\nmortgage rates. And that has been happening. And that’ll, of course, raise demand, lower\nborrowing rates for builders, will help, you know, get builders—will help supply. And so some\nof that should happen. I think most analysts think that it would have to be pretty big changes for\nit to matter a lot for the—big changes in rates to matter a lot for the housing sector. And, you\nknow, the other thing is by—you know, by achieving maximum employment and price stability,\nthat’s a strong economy. That’s a good economy for housing.\nPage 22 of 26\nSeptember 17, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nAnd then the last thing I’ll say is, you know, there’s a deeper problem here that is not a\ncyclical problem that the Fed can address, and that just is a pretty much nationwide housing\nshortage, or a lot of places in the country just don’t have enough housing for people. And, you\nknow, all of the areas around metropolitan areas—like Washington, for example—are very built\nup, and so you’re having to build farther and farther out. And that—so that’s where it is.\nNICOLE GOODKIND. And just a quick follow-up. During the last SEP, or the press\nconference following the last SEP, you seemed to indicate that policymakers lacked conviction\nabout their projections. And I’m wondering if you still feel that way.\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, forecasting is very difficult, even in placid times. And,\nas I’ve mentioned before, forecasters are a humble lot, with much to be humble about. So I think\nright now is a particularly challenging time, even more uncertain than usual. And so I don’t\nknow any forecaster anywhere really—ask any of the forecasters whether they have great\nconfidence in their forecast right now. I think they’ll honestly say “no.”\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. Thank you, Chair Powell. Jennifer Schonberger with\nYahoo Finance. If you’re cutting rates, why continue to reduce the size of your balance sheet\n[rather] than pause the unwinding?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, I think we’re—you know, we’re cutting the size of our balance\nsheet quite marginally now. As you know, with the balance sheet, we’re still in an abundant-\nreserves condition. And we’ve said that we would stop somewhat above a—somewhat above an\nample-reserves level. That’s where we are. And we’re—you know, we’re getting closer to that.\nWe’re monitoring it very carefully. We don’t think that that has, at all, significant\nmacroeconomic effects. These are pretty small numbers moving around inside a giant economy.\nPage 23 of 26\nSeptember 17, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nYou know, the level of runoff is not very large. So I wouldn’t attribute macroeconomic\nconsequences to that, at this point.\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. And at his recent confirmation hearing, Stephen Miran\nbrought up that the Fed actually has three mandates from Congress—not just jobs and stable\nprices, but also moderate long-term interest rates. So what does Congress mean by “moderate\nlong-term interest rates?” How should we understand that when we see the 10-year Treasury\nmoving? And how do you think about this part of the mandate when policy choices, like rate\ncuts or balance sheet reductions, affect the long end of the yield curve?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we always think of it as the dual mandate, maximum employment\nand price stability, for a long time, because we think moderate, long-term interest rates are\nsomething that will result from stable inflation—low and stable inflation and maximum\nemployment. So we don’t—we haven’t thought about that for a very long time as a third\nmandate that requires independent action. So that’s where that is. And there’s no thought of—as\nfar as I’m concerned, there’s no thought of considering that, you know, considering that we\nsomehow incorporate that in as something in a different way.\nMATT EGAN. Thanks, Chair Powell. Matt Egan from CNN. We recently learned that\naverage FICO credit scores are down this year by 2 points, the most since 2009 during the Great\nRecession. And delinquencies are high for car loans, personal loans, credit cards. How\nconcerned, if at all, are you about the health of consumer finances? And do you expect today’s\ncut will help?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, you know, we’re aware of that. I think default rates have been\nkind of ticking up. And we do watch that. They’re not at a level—I don’t believe they’re at a\nlevel where, overall, they’re, you know, terribly concerning. But it is something that we watch.\nPage 24 of 26\nSeptember 17, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nYou know, lower rates should support economic activity. I don’t know that one rate cut will\nhave, you know, a visible effect on that. But over time, you know, a strong economy with a\nstrong labor market is what we’re—what we’re aiming for, and stable prices. So that should\nhelp.\nMATT EGAN. Just a follow-up. This rate cut is coming at a time when the stock market\nis at or near all-time highs. And some valuation metrics are elevated historically. Is there a risk\nthat cutting rates could overheat financial markets, potentially fueling a bubble?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, we’re tightly focused on our goals, right? And our goals\nare maximum employment and price stability. And so we take the actions that we take with an\neye on those goals. Separately—and that’s why we did what we did today.\nSeparately, we monitor financial stability very, very carefully. And, you know, I would\nsay it’s a mixed picture, but households are in good shape, banks are in good shape. Overall,\nhouseholds are still in good shape in the aggregate. And I know that people at the lower end of\nthe income spectrum are under pressure, obviously. But from a financial stability perspective,\nwe monitor that picture. We don’t have a view that there’s a right or wrong level of asset prices\nfor any particular financial asset, but we monitor the whole picture, really looking for structural\nvulnerabilities, and I would say those are not elevated right now.\nJEAN YUNG. Hi, Chair Powell. Jean Yung with MNI Market News. I wanted to ask\nabout inflation expectations. You’ve said the Fed can’t take the stability of inflation\nexpectations for granted. You mentioned at the short run they’ve gone up a little bit. I wonder if\nyou can talk a bit about that. And then also at the long run, I’m wondering, do you see evidence\nthat the debate over Fed independence and the growing deficit is putting pressure on inflation\nexpectations?\nPage 25 of 26\nSeptember 17, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. So, as you said, shorter-term inflation expectations have tended to\nrespond to near-term inflation, so if inflation goes up, inflation expectations will predict that it\ntakes just a little while to get back down.\nFortunately, throughout this period, longer-term inflation expectations, both breakeven in\nthe markets and almost all of the longer-term surveys—Michigan being a bit of an outlier\nlately—have been just rock solid in terms of, you know, running at levels that are consistent with\n2 percent inflation over time. So we don’t take that for granted. We actually assume that our\nactions have a real effect on that, and that, you know, we need to, you know, continually show\nand also mention/discuss our commitment to 2 percent inflation. And so you’ll hear us doing\nthat.\nBut, you know, we’re—as I mentioned, it’s a difficult situation because we have risks\nthat are both affecting the labor market and inflation. Those are our two goals. And so we have\nto balance those two. When they’re both at risk, we have to balance them, and that’s really what\nwe’re trying to do.\nI don’t— the latter part of your question was about independence. You know, I don’t see\nmarket participants—I don’t see that that’s something they’re factoring in right now in terms of\nsetting interest rates.\nThanks very much.\nPage 26 of 26"

    "press_conf": "October 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nTranscript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference\nOctober 29, 2025\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on\nachieving our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of\nthe American people. Although some important federal government data have been delayed due\nto the shutdown, the public- and private-sector data that have remained available suggest that the\noutlook for employment and inflation has not changed much since our meeting in September.\nConditions in the labor market appear to be gradually cooling, and inflation remains somewhat\nelevated.\nIn support of our goals, and in light of the balance of risks to employment and inflation,\ntoday the Federal Open Market Committee decided to lower our policy interest rate by\n¼ percentage point. We also decided to conclude the reduction of our aggregate securities\nholdings as of December 1. I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly\nreviewing economic developments.\nAvailable indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate\npace. GDP rose at a 1.6 percent pace in the first half of the year, down from 2.4 percent last\nyear. Data available prior to the shutdown show that growth in economic activity may be on a\nsomewhat firmer trajectory than expected, primarily reflecting stronger consumer spending.\nBusiness investment in equipment and intangibles has continued to expand, while activity in the\nhousing sector remains weak. The shutdown of the federal government will weigh on economic\nactivity while it persists, but these effects should reverse after the shutdown ends.\nIn the labor market, the unemployment rate remained relatively low through August. Job\ngains have slowed significantly since earlier in the year. A good part of the slowing likely\nreflects a decline in the growth of the labor force due to lower immigration and labor force\nPage 1 of 28\nOctober 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nparticipation, though labor demand has clearly softened as well. Although official employment\ndata for September are delayed, available evidence suggests that both layoffs and hiring remain\nlow, and that both households’ perceptions of job availability and firms’ perceptions of hiring\ndifficulty continue to decline. In this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the\ndownside risks to employment appear to have risen in recent months.\nInflation has eased significantly from its highs in mid-2022 but remains somewhat\nelevated relative to our 2 percent longer-run goal. Estimates based on the consumer price index\nsuggest that total PCE prices rose 2.8 percent over the 12 months ending in September and that,\nexcluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent as well.\nThese readings are higher than earlier in the year, as inflation for goods has picked up. In\ncontrast, disinflation appears to be continuing for services. Near-term measures of inflation\nexpectations have moved up, on balance, over the course of this year on news about tariffs, as\nreflected in both market- and survey-based measures. Beyond the next year or so, however, most\nmeasures of longer-term expectations remain consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal.\nOur monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people. At today’s meeting, the Committee\ndecided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point to 3¾ to\n4 percent.\nHigher tariffs are pushing up prices in some categories of goods, resulting in higher\noverall inflation. A reasonable base case is that the effects on inflation will be relatively short\nlived—a one-time shift in the price level. But it is also possible that the inflationary effects\ncould instead be more persistent, and that is a risk to be assessed and managed. Our obligation is\nPage 2 of 28\nOctober 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nto ensure that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation\nproblem.\nIn the near term, risks to inflation are tilted to the upside and risks to employment to the\ndownside—a challenging situation. There is no risk-free path for policy as we navigate this\ntension between our employment and inflation goals. Our framework calls for us to take a\nbalanced approach in promoting both sides of our dual mandate. With downside risks to\nemployment having increased in recent months, the balance of risks has shifted. Accordingly,\nwe judged it appropriate at this meeting to take another step toward a more neutral policy stance.\nWith today’s decision, we remain well positioned to respond in a timely way to potential\neconomic developments. We will continue to determine the appropriate stance of monetary\npolicy based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. We continue\nto face two-sided risks. In the Committee’s discussions at this meeting, there were strongly\ndiffering views about how to proceed in December. A further reduction in the policy rate at the\nDecember meeting is not a foregone conclusion—far from it. Policy is not on a preset course.\nAt today’s meeting, the Committee also decided to conclude the reduction of our\naggregate securities holdings as of December 1. Our long-stated plan has been to stop balance\nsheet runoff when reserves are somewhat above the level we judge consistent with ample reserve\nconditions. Signs have clearly emerged that we have reached that standard. In money markets,\nrepo rates have moved up relative to our administered rates, and we have seen more notable\npressures on selected dates along with more use of our standing repo facility. In addition, the\neffective federal funds rate has begun to move up relative to the rate of interest on reserve\nbalances. These developments are what we expected to see as the size of our balance sheet\ndeclined and warrant today’s decision to cease runoff.\nPage 3 of 28\nOctober 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nOver the three and a half years that we have been shrinking our balance sheet, our\nsecurities holdings have declined by $2.2 trillion. As a share of nominal GDP, our balance sheet\nhas fallen from 35 percent to about 21 percent. In December, we will enter the next phase of our\nnormalization plans by holding the size of our balance sheet steady for a time while reserve\nbalances continue to move gradually lower as other nonreserve liabilities such as currency keep\ngrowing. We will continue to allow agency securities to run off our balance sheet and will\nreinvest the proceeds from those securities in Treasury bills, furthering progress toward a\nportfolio consisting primarily of Treasury securities. This reinvestment strategy will also help\nmove the weighted average maturity of our portfolio closer to that of the outstanding stock of\nTreasury securities, thus furthering the normalization of the composition of our balance sheet.\nThe Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy—maximum employment and\nstable prices. We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation\nsustainably to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.\nOur success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans. We understand that our\nactions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in\nservice to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our\nmaximum-employment and price-stability goals. Thank you. I look forward to your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nick.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, are you\nuncomfortable with how market pricing has assumed a rate cut is a foregone conclusion at your\nnext meeting?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, as I just mentioned, a further reduction to the policy rate at the\nDecember meeting is not a foregone conclusion, as I’ve just said. So I would say that that needs\nPage 4 of 28\nOctober 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nto be taken on board. We had—you know, I would just say this—19 participants on the\nCommittee, everyone works very hard at this and takes their obligations to serve the American\npeople very seriously. And at a time when we have tension between our two goals, we have\nstrong views across the Committee. And, as I mentioned, they were strongly differing views\ntoday. And the “takeaway” from that is that we haven’t made a decision about December, and\nwe’re going to be looking at the data that we have, how that affects the outlook and the balance\nof risks, and I’ll just say that.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. You and some of your colleagues have framed last month and maybe\ntoday—I won’t put words in your mouth—as a risk-management exercise. At what point do you\nconclude that you’ve taken out enough insurance? Are you looking for some kind of\nimprovement in the outlook? Or could this unfold along the lines of last year, where you made a\nsequence of adjustments and waited to gather more information?\nCHAIR POWELL. So the way we have been thinking—the way I’ve been thinking\nabout it is the risks to the two goals—for a very long time, the risk was clearly of higher\ninflation, and then that has changed now. And as we saw the—particularly after we saw—after\nthe July meeting, we saw downward revisions in job creation, we saw a very different picture of\nthe labor market and suggested that there were higher downside risks to the labor market than we\nhad thought. And that suggested that policy, which we had been holding at a, I would say,\n“modestly”—other people would say “moderately”—restrictive level, needed to move more in\nthe direction, over time, of neutral. If the two goals are sort of equally at risk, then you ought to\nbe at neutral, because one of them is calling for you to hike, and one of them is calling for you to\ncut. So if that got back into balance, then you’d want to be roughly at neutral. So in that sense,\nPage 5 of 28\nOctober 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nit was a [case of] risk management, and I would say the same about today—sort of the same\nlogic. But as I mentioned, going forward is a different thing.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Claire.\nCLAIRE JONES. Claire Jones, Financial Times. Thank you for taking this question.\nWe’ve just heard from you that the discussion in December and the conclusion that the\ndiscussion is not a foregone conclusion. I’d like to just dig into that a little bit more, about what\nsort of arguments were brought up. Was there any consideration, for instance, of the investment\nwe’re seeing in AI and some of the generation of household wealth through rises in stock prices\nrelated to the AI boom? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. I wouldn’t say that’s a—that’s a factor in everyone’s assessment of\nthe economy. I wouldn’t say it’s a driving factor, I don’t think, for anybody. I guess I would say\nit this way: Once again, I would just point out that we have the situation where the risks are to\nthe upside for inflation and to the downside for employment. We have one tool. It can’t do both\nof those—you can’t address both of those at once. You’ve got a very different situation. So you\nhave some people—people have different forecasts, right? So they’ll feel—they’ll forecast faster\nor slower progress on one or the other. And they also have different levels of risk aversion. And\npeople—some will be more averse to inflation overruns, and some will be more averse to\nunderruns of employment. And so you put that together, and as you can see from the SEP and\nfrom the public discussion that goes on between the meetings when participants go out and talk,\nthey’re very disparate views. And they were reflected in strongly differing views in today’s\nmeeting, as I pointed out in my remarks. And that’s what leads me to say that, that we haven’t\nmade a decision about December. You know, I always say that it’s a fact that we don’t make\nPage 6 of 28\nOctober 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ndecisions in advance. But this is—I’m saying something in addition here, that it’s not—it’s not\nto be seen as a foregone conclusion—in fact, far from it.\nCLAIRE JONES. Can I just ask you a quick follow-up on QT? How much of the fund\nimpressions we’ve seen in money markets are related to the U.S. Treasury issuing more short-\nterm debt?\nCHAIR POWELL. That could be one of the factors, but the reality is that we’ve seen—\nthe things that we’ve seen, higher repo rates and the federal funds rate moving up, these are the\nvery things that we—that we look for. We actually have a framework for looking at the place\nwe’re trying to reach. What we said for a long time now is that when we feel like we’re a little\nbit or a bit above what we consider a level that’s ample that we would freeze the size of the\nbalance sheet. Of course, reserves will continue to decline from that point forward as nonreserve\nliabilities grow. So this happened, some of it—some things have been happening for some time\nnow, showing a gradual tightening in money market conditions. Really, in the last, call it, three\nweeks or so, you’ve seen more significant tightening and I think a clear assessment that we’re at\nthat place.\nThe other thing is, we’re—the balance sheet is shrinking at a very, very slow pace now.\nWe’ve reduced it by half twice, and so there’s not a lot of benefit to be—to be holding on for it\nto get the last few dollars, because, again, when the balance sheet—reserves are going to\ncontinue to shrink as nonreserves grow. So there was support on the Committee, as we thought\nabout it, to go ahead with this and announce effective December 1 that we will be freezing the\nsize of the balance sheet. And the December 1 date gives the markets a little bit of time to adapt.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Colby.\nPage 7 of 28\nOctober 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCOLBY SMITH. Thank you. Colby Smith with the New York Times. So much of the\nrationale for cutting interest rates, even as inflation moves away from the 2 percent target, seems\nto be that there are these mounting downside risks to the labor market. But if those don’t\nmaterialize and the labor market either stabilizes around current employment levels or even starts\nto strengthen somewhat, how would that change your perception of how much interest rates need\nto fall from here? Would you then be a bit more concerned about underlying inflation and the\npossibility of second-round effects from tariffs?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah, I mean in principle if you were to see data that suggested that\nthe labor market is strengthening or even that it’s stabilizing, that would certainly play into our\ndecisions going forward. So, and we do have—we get some data. The labor market is a place\nwhere we get—for example, we get the state-level data on initial claims, which are sending sort\nof a signal of more of the same. We also get job openings, and we’ll get lots of survey data,\nwe’ll get the Beige Book and things like that. So we’ll have a—we’ll have a picture of what’s\ngoing on in the labor market. And the fact that we’re not seeing an uptick in claims or a\ndowntick, really, in openings suggests that you’re seeing maybe continued very gradual cooling,\nbut nothing more than that. So that does give you some comfort.\nCOLBY SMITH. But if this shutdown lasts a while longer and you don’t have that data\nin hand, I’m just wondering how that hinders the Committee’s ability to assess the state of the\nlabor market and make the right policy decisions. And, also, how much is that factoring into the\ndebate about December?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah. So we’ll—we get—I mentioned what we get in the labor area.\nWe get some data in inflation, some data in economic activity. And we’ll get—we’ll have a\npicture of what’s going on. We also will have the Beige Book again. I would say we’re not\nPage 8 of 28\nOctober 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ngoing to be able to have the detailed feel of things, but I think if there were significant or\nmaterial change in the economy one way or another, I think we’d pick that up through this.\nSo in terms of how it might affect December, it’s really hard to say. December is a—the\nmeeting’s, like, six weeks away. We just don’t know what we’re going to get. If there is a very\nhigh level of uncertainty, then that could be an argument in favor of caution about moving. But\nwe’ll have to see how it unfolds.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Mr. Chairman, can you characterize the\nmeeting in terms of, you said, strongly differing views? Was this a close call, this cut? Or was it\na close call maybe the other way, because you had dissents on both sides? Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. So I was referring to the discussion about—to the extent it related to\nDecember. You saw we had two dissents, one for 50 and one for no cut. So that was a strong,\nsolid vote in favor of this cut. The strongly differing views were really about the future, what\ndoes that look like? And I think people are saying—they’re noticing stronger economic activity.\nForecasters generally, broadly, have raised their economic growth forecast for this year and next\nyear, in some cases quite materially. In the meantime, we see a labor market that’s kind of—I\ndon’t want to say “stable,” but it’s not clearly in motion, it’s not clearly declining quickly in any\ncase. It may be just continuing to gradually cool. And, again, people have different—they have\ndifferent forecasts and expectations about the economy and different risk tolerances. And so\nthere’s—you read the SEP, you read the speeches, you know there are differing views on the\nCommittee and to the point where I said what I said.\nPage 9 of 28\nOctober 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Just a follow-up on the balance sheet. If you stop it—the runoff—\nnow, does that mean you have to go back to actually adding assets sometime next year so that the\nbalance sheet doesn’t shrink as a percent of GDP and become a tightening factor?\nCHAIR POWELL. So you’re right. The place we’ll be on December 1 is that the size of\nthe balance sheet is frozen, and as mortgage-backed securities mature, we’ll reinvest those in\nTreasury bills, which will foster both a more Treasury balance sheet and also a shorter duration.\nSo that’s—in the meantime, if you freeze the size of the balance sheet, the nonreserve\nliabilities—currency, for example—they’re going to continue to grow organically. And, because\nthe size of the balance sheet is frozen, you have further shrinkage in reserves. And reserves is\nthe thing that we’re—that we’re managing that has to be ample.\nSo that’ll happen for a time, but not a tremendously long time. We don’t know exactly\nhow long. But at a certain point, you’ll want to start—you’ll want to start reserves to start\ngradually growing to keep up with the size of the banking system and the size of the economy.\nSo we’ll be adding reserves at a certain point, and that’s the last point. Even then we’ll be—we\ndidn’t make decisions about this today, but we did talk today about the composition of the\nbalance sheet. And there’s a desire that the balance sheet be—right now it’s got a lot more\nduration than the outstanding universe of Treasury securities, and we want to move to a place\nwhere we’re closer to that duration. That’ll take some time. We haven’t made a decision about\nthe ultimate endpoint, but we all agree that we want to move more in the direction of a balance\nsheet that more closely reflects the outstanding Treasuries, and that means a shorter-duration\nbalance sheet. Now, this is something that’s going to be—take a long time and move very, very\ngradually, and I don’t think you’ll notice it in market conditions. But that’s the direction of\nthings.\nPage 10 of 28\nOctober 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jonnelle.\nJONNELLE MARTE. Jonnelle Marte with Bloomberg. How are officials interpreting\nthe latest CPI report? So some components came in lower than expected, but core inflation was\nstill at 3 percent. So at this moment are—what are you learning about the drivers and, also, do\nyou believe that the risks are greater that the Fed makes a mistake on employment or inflation?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, okay, so the September CPI report, we didn’t get PPI after that,\nwhich is—which is important for translation into what we look at, which is PCE inflation. But\nwe can still make a pretty good assessment of what that will be. When we get PPI, there might\nbe some adjustments. But so directionally, it was a little softer than expected, and we always\nbreak it down into the three components. So, basically, you’ve seen goods prices increasing, and\nthat’s really due to tariffs, and that’s due—that’s compared to a longer-run trend of very, very\nmild deflation in goods. So that’s moving inflation up. On the other side of that, good news—\nhousing services inflation has been coming down and is expected to continue to come down. So\nif you remember, a year—a couple years ago, that’s the one that just, we kept expecting it to do\nthat. Now it’s doing—it’s been doing that for some time, and we expect to continue that. That\nleaves—the biggest category is services other than housing services. And that’s kind of been\nmoving sideways over the last few months, but a significant part of that is nonmarket services.\nWe don’t take a lot of signal about the tightness of the economy from that.\nSo if you add all that up, a couple of things to say. One is that inflation away from tariffs\nis actually not so far from our 2 percent goal. We estimate—people have different estimates of\nwhat that is, but it might be five- or six-tenths, and so if it’s 2.8, then core PCE, not including\ntariffs, might be 2.3 or 2.4, in that range, something like that. So that’s not so far from your goal.\nSo that—we look at that, and the thing about tariff inflation is the base case is that it will come,\nPage 11 of 28\nOctober 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nand it probably will increase further. But it is that it will be a one-time increase, and we’ve been\nvery focused for all of this year at making sure that that’s the case and thinking carefully about\nwhat are the—what are the pathways through which it could become something else,\ntroublesome inflation. One of those would be a really tight labor market. We don’t see that.\nAnother could be inflation expectations moving. We don’t see that. So I think—we’re watching\nthis very carefully. I think it’s—it’s not the case that we’re just assuming that it’s going to be a\none-time inflation. We understand fully that this is a risk we have to monitor and ultimately\nmanage.\nJONNELLE MARTE. With a stubborn services inflation, what are some of the things\nthat the Fed could do to address that, and especially when we’re seeing potentially labor supply\nchallenges?\nCHAIR POWELL. Sorry, say that first—\nJONNELLE MARTE. Stubborn services inflation—\nCHAIR POWELL. Oh, stubborn services inflation. Well, again, the part of services\ninflation that is—that isn’t coming down as we would like it to is the nonmarket part of\nnonhousing services. And, overall, that’s just something that we expect will come down. The\nnonhousing—the nonmarket part of it should come down. It largely reflects higher stock prices\nand financial services that are imputed, rather than actually paid, is a big part of that. But also,\njust—we think policy is still modestly restrictive in my telling. So that’s the kind of thing that\nshould lead to a gradually cooling economy. That’s one of the reasons you see a gradually\ncooling labor market, [it] is because Fed policy is modestly restrictive. So that should also help\nget that.\nPage 12 of 28\nOctober 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nI want to say, though, we’re absolutely committed to returning inflation to 2 percent. If\nyou look at longer-term surveys or market pricing, you will see that that’s a credible\ncommitment, and there should be no question that that’s where we’re going.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Chris.\nCHRIS RUGABER. Great, thank you. Chris Rugaber, Associated Press. So there’s a\nbig investment boom in AI infrastructure right now, as you know, and wondering if the existence\nof such a boom would indicate that rates are not that restrictive after all, and could further rate\ncuts at this point perhaps fuel an excess level of investment there or market bubbles? How is the\nFed thinking about that?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I don’t—I don’t think that the—you’re right, there’s a—there’s a\nlot of data centers being built and other investments being made around the country and around\nthe world. And big U.S. companies are just investing a lot of resources in thinking about how\nAI, which will be based on those data centers, run through data centers, is going to affect their\nbusinesses. So it’s a big deal. I don’t think that the spending that happens to build data centers\nall over the country is especially interest sensitive. It’s based on longer-run, it’s—longer-run\nassessments that this is an area where there’s going to be a lot of investment and that’s going to\ndrive higher productivity and that sort of things. I don’t know how those investments will work\nout, but I don’t think they’re particularly interest sensitive compared to some of the other sectors.\nCHRIS RUGABER. And then just a quick follow-up. You mentioned that you do have\ndata that you’re looking at for inflation and growth in the absence of government data. Could\nyou give us a sense—and I think we know a lot about the jobs data that’s out there—can you\ngive us a sense of what you’re looking at to track inflation in the absence of government data?\nThank you.\nPage 13 of 28\nOctober 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. So it’s a lot of things. And it doesn’t replace government data, but\nyou know all of these, it’s—I’ll just mention some of the many, many names: PriceStats, Adobe,\nand others. And for wage inflation, there’s ADP data. On spending—you’re going to ask about\nspending at some point—there are lots of other things that we look at. But it’s, again, it’s, it’s\nmany, many different sources and, again, including what we get out of the Beige Book, which\nwill be sort of—come out mid-cycle as always. And it doesn’t replace the government data, but\nit gives us a picture. Again, I think if something material were happening, if there were material\ndevelopments, I think we would pick that up. I don’t think we’ll be able to have a very granular\nunderstanding of the economy while this—while this data is not available.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Howard.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Howard Schneider with Reuters. Thank you. I just wanted\nyou to elaborate a little bit on what you said a moment ago about the lack—the continued\nshutdown making it more difficult to make a move in December, and that may make you more\ncautious. To the degree you are relying on private data that isn’t the gold standard or that you’re\nrelying on your own surveys or the Beige Book, do you worry at some point you’re going to\nhave to start making policy by anecdote?\nCHAIR POWELL. This is a temporary state of affairs. And we’re going to do our jobs,\nwe’re going to collect every scrap of data we can find, evaluate it, and think carefully about it.\nAnd that’s our jobs—that’s what we’re going to do. If you ask me, “Could it affect the\nDecember meeting?”, I’m not saying it’s going to, but, yeah, you could imagine that—what do\nyou do if—what do you do if you’re driving in the fog? You slow down. So that could or could\nnot. I don’t know how that’s going to play into things. We may get—the data may come back.\nBut there’s a possibility that it would make sense to be more cautious about moving. I’m not—\nPage 14 of 28\nOctober 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nI’m not committing to that, I’m just saying it’s certainly a possibility that you would say, “We\nreally can’t see, so let’s slow down.”\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. As a follow-up, in the debate on this meeting, we saw\nrecently some pretty big layoff announcements coming from Amazon and others—wondering if\nthat figured into the discussion at all that you’re starting to see the turn, this tension between\ngrowth and employment starting to be resolved to the detriment of employment. And, secondly,\nsome of the stresses starting to appear in the bottom spur of the K, as they call it, household\nhealth premiums that are going to be—possibly be going up quite substantially, things like that.\nHas that started to become a factor in your policy discussion?\nCHAIR POWELL. So those are—those are both things that we’re watching very, very,\nvery carefully. To start with the layoffs, you’re right—you see a significant number of\ncompanies either announcing that they are not going to be doing much hiring or actually doing\nlayoffs, and much of the time they’re talking about AI and what it can do. So we’re watching\nthat very carefully. And, yes, it could absolutely have implications for job creation. We don’t\nreally see it in the initial claims data yet. Now, it’s not a surprise that we don’t—it takes some\ntime for it to get in there—but we’re watching that really carefully. But, again, don’t see it yet in\nthe—in the initial claims data.\nOn the K-shaped economy thing, I would say the same thing, or similar thing. We are—\nif you listen to the earnings calls or the reports of big, public, consumer-facing companies, many,\nmany of them are saying that there’s a bifurcated economy there and that consumers at the lower\nend are struggling and buying less and shifting to lower-cost products, but that at the top, people\nare spending at the higher income and wealth, and they’re—so much, much anecdotal data on\nthat. And so we think there’s something there—so.\nPage 15 of 28\nOctober 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMICHELLE SMITH. Edward.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you. Edward Lawrence with Fox Business. So Mr.\nChairman, I want to take another crack at the further reduction in rates is not a foregone\nconclusion in December—you said “far from it.” So if a cut might not be on the table for\nDecember because of lack of data, what is the other concerns then stem from? So if it’s not lack\nof data as the reason December is not a foregone conclusion, what other things could be the\nconcern then?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, perspectives of people on the Committee that we’ve now\nmoved 150 basis points and that we’re down into—you’re into that range between 3 and 4,\nwhere most estimates of—many estimates of the neutral rate live in that 3 to 4 percent area.\nYou’re there now. You’re above the median number for the Committee. But I think there are\npeople on the Committee who have higher estimates of the neutral rate, and that’s—you can\nargue these positions since it can’t be directly observed, the neutral rate. So I think for some part\nof the Committee, it’s time to maybe take a step back and see whether there really are downside\nrisks to the labor market, or see whether, in fact, the growth—that the stronger growth that we’re\nseeing is real.\nOrdinarily, the labor market is a better indicator of the momentum of the economy than\nthe spending data. That’s the allure. In this case, that gives a more downbeat read. So people\njust have—again, we’ve cut 50 more basis points in the last two meetings and there was a sense,\nfrom some, “let’s pause here” kind of thing, and a sense from others wanting to go ahead. But\nthat’s why I say differing views—strongly differing views.\nPage 16 of 28\nOctober 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. So on that division, then, you’re talking about going forward.\nSo what’s more important in this division? Is it inflation risks? Is it employment risks? Or is\nthere a deeper philosophy division among the Board?\nCHAIR POWELL. I—look, everybody on the Committee is deeply committed to doing\nthe right thing to achieve our goals: maximum employment and stable prices. You have\ndifferences on how to do that. And as I mentioned, some of that is different forecasts, but a lot\nof it is also different risk aversions to the two different variables, which is common through,\nthrough all federal reserves, they’re—people just have different risk tolerances, let’s say. So that\nleads you to people with disparate views. You will know that from the speeches you’ve been\nlistening to from my colleagues. And so we’re at a place now where we have, in fact, cut two\nmore times, and now we’re 150 basis points closer to neutral, wherever that may be, than we\nwere a year ago. And so there’s a growing chorus now of feeling like maybe this is where we\nshould at least wait a cycle, something like that. That’s what it is. It’s just what you think it\nwould be. It’s—and, again, you’ve seen it in the September Summary of Economic Projections.\nYou’ve seen this in the public remarks of FOMC participants. And now I’m telling you that’s\nwhat—that’s what you can expect in the minutes. And I’m just telling you that’s what happened\nin the meeting.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Elizabeth.\nELIZABETH SCHULZE. Thank you so much. Elizabeth Schulze with ABC News.\nWhat is your explanation for why the job market is weakening right now, and what will this rate\ncut do to improve the job market?\nCHAIR POWELL. So the—I think there are two things affecting the job market, and one\nof them is just a dramatic reduction in the supply of new workers. So and that’s two things—\nPage 17 of 28\nOctober 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthat’s declining labor force participation, which is a cyclical thing, and then there’s declining\nimmigration—which is just a big policy change that actually began in the last Administration and\nhas been accelerated now. So a big part of the whole story is that supply-side story. Okay.\nIn addition, labor demand has declined, and so the labor—the unemployment rate has\ngone down, meaning that demand for workers has gone down a little more than supply. So that’s\nwhat’s going on, and—but it is mostly a supply function. It’s mostly a function of the change in\nsupply, I think and many people think. So the question then is, what does—what does our tool\ndo, which supports demand? And so—and I would just say, when you’re in a situation where\njob creation, if you adjust for likely overcounting in the way that BLS does its work, is pretty\nclose to zero. So maximum employment doesn’t, on a sustainable basis, doesn’t—if you’re\nmaking, creating zero jobs, if it’s in equilibrium, if it’s in balance, it’s a pretty, as I said before,\npretty curious balance. So I thought, and many of my colleagues thought—in fact, you’ve seen\nthe last two meetings that it was appropriate for us to react by supporting demand with our rates.\nAnd we’ve done that—we’ve reduced so that rates are looser. I wouldn’t say that they’re\naccommodative right now, but they’re meaningfully less tight than they were. And that should\nhelp so that at least the labor market doesn’t get worse. It’s a complicated situation, and some\npeople argue that this is supply and we really can’t affect it much with our tools, but others\nargue, as I do, that there is an effect from demand, and that we should use our tools to support\nthe labor market when we see this happening.\nELIZABETH SCHULZE. You also talked about tariffs causing a one-time price\nincrease. Should American households, consumers expect that inflation will continue to go up\nthis year because of those tariffs?\nPage 18 of 28\nOctober 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. So the basic expectation is that there will be some additional\nincreased inflation because it takes a while for tariffs to work their way through the production\nchain and finally get to consumers. And we see this now from the tariffs that were put in place\nnow many months ago—we see those effects. But if you put tariffs in effect—and they’ve been\ncoming into effect consistently in February, March, April, May—and that’s all happening, so\nthat’ll continue to happen for some time, probably into the spring. These are not big increases,\nthough. These are a tenth or so on inflation. They may be big increases on a particular product\nthat’s been tariffed, but, overall, these are fairly modest. I think some projections—we’re at\n2.8 percent inflation—you might get two or three more tenths, or four more tenths maybe. But\nthen, as all the tariffs are in, they stop generating inflation. You’ve had a one-time price\nincrease. As long as you’re not—at least this is the theory, this is how we believe and hope that\nit will work out—once the last tariff is put on something, at that point it becomes a higher price\nlevel, but it stops going up, if you will, prices stop going up, they’ll just be at that level. And\nthen measured inflation will come back down to non-tariff inflation. And as I mentioned, non-\ntariff inflation is not so far from 2 percent now.\nNow, consumers are not interested in that story. Their prices are higher. More than that,\nthe reason they’re so unhappy about inflation is the inflation that we had in 2021, ’22, ’23—\nbecause you can say that prices aren’t going up as much, but that doesn’t mean people aren’t\nfeeling those higher prices from the inflation we had two or three years ago. They are. And\nthat’s, I think, a large part of why the public—you sample people, inflation is still very much\nmaking people quite unhappy, even—and it’s nice that prices are not going up as fast as they\nwere, but they’re still much higher than they were. And it’ll take some time for that effect to\nwear off. As real incomes rise, it will feel better over time. But that’s going to take time.\nPage 19 of 28\nOctober 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMICHELLE SMITH. Mike.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio. Do you\nhave any concerns that equity markets are—or are close to being—overvalued at this point?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, we don’t look at any one asset price and say, “Hey, that’s\nwrong.” It’s not our job to do that. We look at the overall financial system, and we ask whether\nit’s stable and whether it could withstand shocks, right? So banks are well capitalized, while\nsome households are clearly under stress. In the aggregate, households are in good shape\nfinancially—relatively, relatively manageable levels of debt. At the lower-income spectrum, you\nare seeing rising defaults, particularly in subprime auto, but, nonetheless, in the aggregate pretty\ngood. And you don’t see—so you don’t see too much leverage in the banking system or the\nfinancial system. It’s a mixed picture, but it’s not an overly troubling picture. And, again, I’m\nnot—it’s not appropriate—we don’t set asset prices. Markets do that.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Well, are you—you must be well aware by lowering interest rates\nyou’re contributing to additional asset price increases. And I wonder how you balance the idea\nthat lowering rates would help the labor market with the reality that it seems more likely to be\nstimulating increased investment in AI, which is the rationale for thousands of job cuts that have\nbeen announced in the last few weeks.\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah, I don’t—I don’t think interest rates are an important part of the\nAI—the data center story. I think—people think there are great economics in building these data\ncenters, and they’re making a lot of money building them, and I think they have very high\npresent value and all that sort of thing. It’s not really—it’s not about 25 basis points here or\nthere. We use our tools to support the labor market and to create price stability. That’s what we\ndo. That’s our two jobs, right? So we’re here to—by lowering rates at the margin, that will\nPage 20 of 28\nOctober 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nsupport demand, and that will support more hiring. And that’s why we do it. Now, no 25 basis\npoint or even 50 basis point hike is going to be a dispositive thing. But, ultimately, lower rates\nwill support more demand, and that’ll support hiring over time. And, of course, we also have to\nbe careful about this, which is what we’ve been doing because we know where inflation is and\nwe know—I’ve told you the story, this complicated story, but this is the best assessment that we\ncan make and—but because there’s uncertainty around inflation and the path ahead for inflation,\nthat’s why we’re going—that’s why the pace we’re going has been a careful one.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi. Victoria Guida from Politico. On AI, I’m just wondering, it\nseems like a lot of the economic growth that we’ve been seeing is fed by investments in AI. So\nhow worried are you about what the sudden contraction in tech investment would mean for the\noverall economy? Is there enough strength in other sectors? And, specifically, are there any\nlessons that you take from the 1990s in how you might approach what’s happening right now?\nCHAIR POWELL. This is—this is different in the sense that these companies—the\ncompanies that are so highly valued—actually have earnings and stuff like that. So you go back\nto the ’90s and the dot-com [period], they were—these were ideas rather than companies. And\nwe’re—so there’s a clear bubble there, whereas the—I won’t go into particular names, but they\nactually have earnings, and it looks like they have business models and profits and that kind of\nthing. So it’s really a different thing.\nYou know, the investment we’re getting in equipment and all those things that go into\ncreating data centers and feeding the AI, it’s clearly one of the big sources of growth in the\neconomy. Consumer spending also, though, has been—is much bigger than that and has been\ngrowing and has defied a lot of, you know, negative forecasts, continuing to do so this year.\nPage 21 of 28\nOctober 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nConsumers are still spending. Now, it is—it may be mostly higher-end consumers or maybe\nskewed that way, but the consumer spending—and that’s a big, big chunk of what’s going on in\nthe economy, bigger than—substantially bigger than AI. You could point to growth—I mean,\nactually, maybe—growth as opposed to level, but consumer spending is a much bigger part of\nthe economy.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. And why do you think that the labor market is slowing so much,\neven though consumer spending is strong?\nCHAIR POWELL. Why has it slowed so much? Well, what’s happened is that the\nsupply of workers has dropped very, very sharply due to mainly immigration, but also lower\nlabor force participation. And that means there’s less need for new jobs, because there’s—there\nisn’t this flow into the pool of labor where people need jobs because there aren’t those people\nnow, so there’s not a supply of workers showing up for jobs. In addition, demand has also gone\ndown and so has—labor force participation has declined, which is more of a sign, in this case, of\ndemand as well as trend. So I think you’re seeing some softening. The economy is growing at a\nslower rate than it was—2.4 percent last year, we think around 1.6 percent this year. It could\nhave been a couple of tenths higher if not for the shutdown. And, of course, that will reverse, but\nyou’ve still got the economy growing at a moderate pace.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Andrew.\nANDREW ACKERMAN. Hey there—Andrew Ackerman with the Washington Post. I\nwanted to ask if you could elaborate on how you think about policy in the context of the data\ndrought. Does it make you inclined to stick with your plans as set out in September in the\nabsence of the data that might change your mind, or does it make you inclined to proceed with\nadded caution because of uncertainty?\nPage 22 of 28\nOctober 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah, well, we’ll know when we face that question—if we face that\nquestion. I—it’ll probably be argued both ways, right? But I’ve said a couple times here that if\nyou—if you really aren’t getting information, you really don’t know, and the economy looks like\nit’s solid and stable and hasn’t really changed, there will be an argument, I don’t know how\npersuasive it will be, but there will be an argument that you slow down in a—when you can’t see\nas far ahead. Others may argue—I’m not sure where this argument will come, but you’re\nperfectly right that you could also argue, things haven’t really changed. But you might not know\nthat, so I don’t know whether we’ll face this or not. I hope we don’t. I hope by the time of the\nDecember meeting, we’re getting a better flow of data. But if we—we’re going to have to do our\njobs one way or the other.\nANDREW ACKERMAN. Okay. I also just wanted to ask a FinReg question. I think\nseveral years ago, you said the overall amount of capital in the system was about right. As the\nFed moves forward with a revised Basel proposal, potentially changes to the G-SIB surcharge,\nhas that changed at all? Or are you planning to significantly reduce the amount of capital in the\nsystem? Thanks.\nCHAIR POWELL. So there’s discussions going on, I think, among the agencies, and I\ndon’t want to get ahead of those discussions. I continue to think that the level of capital, when I\nsaid that in 2020, was about right. And, of course, there’s been much capital added since then,\nthrough various mechanisms, but I look forward to—I know these discussions are really just\ngetting going, they haven’t come to the point where they’re—where they’ve got a whole plan\nand that kind of thing. So I really don’t have much to say on that.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Brian.\nPage 23 of 28\nOctober 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nBRIAN CHEUNG. Hi, Chairman Powell. Brian Cheung with NBC News. Is the\nweakness in the jobs market accelerating, and who’s at risk if the interest rate cuts are not the\neffective medicine for a further slowdown in the labor market?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we do not see the weakness, as you put it, the weakness in the job\nmarket accelerating. I would say, then again, we don’t have—we didn’t get the September\nemployment report, payroll report, but we do get—we look at the unemployment insurance\nclaims, initial claims are reported at the state level, and we still get those. And we can cumulate\nthem and get the national number, and there’s really—I mean, there’s no story. You can look at\nthe numbers. Same thing with the job openings we get from Indeed. There’s just no story over\nthe last four weeks. It’s kind of stable.\nSo you don’t see anything that says that the job market—or, really, any part of the\neconomy—is making a significant deterioration. Don’t see that. You see more things, like I\nmentioned, though, which is that you see big companies making announcements of either layoffs\nor of the idea that they can—they won’t need to hire. Their number of employees is not\nexpected to go up over a number of years. There may be different people working there then—\nthey say that too. But they don’t need a bigger head count. So you see those kinds of things.\nYou don’t see it in the aggregate numbers—the layoff numbers have not gone up. But job\ncreation is very low. And the job-finding rate for people who are unemployed is very low. But\nthe unemployment rate is very low as well, 4.3 percent is a low employment—unemployment\nrate.\nBRIAN CHEUNG. And so, as you make these cuts, is it the lower-income workers that\nyou’re thinking about, or those who might have their jobs automated? Is there a particular—\nCHAIR POWELL. That we’re thinking of?\nPage 24 of 28\nOctober 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nBRIAN CHEUNG. —section of the labor market that you’re particularly—\nCHAIR POWELL. So, we can’t—our tools don’t allow us to target any demographic or\nany income level and that kind of thing. I do think that people—we saw this during the Global\nFinancial Crisis and the long recovery. If you have a long period of very strong labor market\nconditions, it benefits people at the lower end the most. The last two or three years of that long\nexpansion, people at the lower part of the income spectrum were getting the biggest benefits, and\nlots of things were happening in that space, demographically, which were very constructive.\nAnd we’re not at that place right now. But so, yeah, a stronger labor market is the best thing we\ncan do for the public. It’s also part of our job. It is half of our job. But it is absolutely the best\nthing we can do for people, along with keeping prices stable. Those two things. I mean,\ninflation also hurts people on fixed incomes more than other people.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Courtenay.\nCOURTENAY BROWN. Hi, Chair Powell. Courtenay Brown from Axios. As you\nknow, the 12 Reserve Bank presidents’ terms are up for renewal at the end of February. I’m\nwondering if you can give us a timeline for when the Board will consider those reappointments\nand whether we can expect everyone to be re-upped or if we can expect some changes.\nCHAIR POWELL. So it’s a process that we go through, under the law. The way the law\nworks is, we have a reappointment process every five years for all of the—all of the Reserve—\neach of them and all of them. We’re in the middle of that process, and we’re going to complete\nit in a timely way. And I really—that’s really all I can say.\nCOURTENAY BROWN. Okay, thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Daniel.\nPage 25 of 28\nOctober 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nDANIEL AVIS. Daniel Avis, Agence France-Presse. You now have dissents in three\nconsecutive FOMC meetings, but in this meeting you had dissents going in both directions. And\nyou just mentioned the strong disagreement over the future path of rate cuts. Have these\ndisagreements complicated your role presiding over the FOMC meetings? And, if so, how?\nCHAIR POWELL. I wouldn’t say that, no. I think you—you have to take what comes,\nand what comes right now is a pretty challenging situation where we have—first of all, we have\n4.3 percent unemployment, we have an economy that’s growing close to 2 percent. So, overall,\nit’s a good picture. It’s a good picture. But in terms of our policy, we have upside risks to\ninflation, downside risks to employment. And this is a very difficult thing for a central bank,\nbecause one of those calls for rates to be lower, one calls for rates to be higher. We can’t do\nboth. So we have to balance the two, and so it’s a challenging thing.\nAnd as we have worked our way through this process, you would expect that there would\nbe a range of views across the Committee on what to do and the speed with which we should do\nit. And that’s what we have. That makes a lot of sense to me. These are—all of these people\nare people who take their jobs very seriously, work very hard at this, and just want to do what’s\nright for the American people. But they have different views on what that is. And it’s an honor\nto work among people who care that much. It is. But I don’t feel that it’s unfair or anything like\nthat. It’s just—it’s a time when we’re making quite difficult judgments in real time, and I\nbelieve we’ll get through this, and I think we’ve done sort of the right things so far this year. I\nthink we were—it was appropriate for us to be careful about this. I think it would not be\nappropriate to just ignore or assume away the inflation issue. At the same time, I think the risk\nof higher, more persistent inflation has declined significantly since April. And if we do wind up\nresuming rate cuts at some point—we will at some point—I think we’re trying to get to the end\nPage 26 of 28\nOctober 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nof this cycle with the labor market in a good place and with inflation on its way to 2 percent or at\n2 percent. So that’s all we’re trying to do, and we’re doing it under quite challenging\ncircumstances and doing the best we can.\nMICHELLE SMITH. We’ll go to Jennifer, for the last question.\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. Thank you so much, Chair Powell. Jennifer Schonberger\nwith Yahoo Finance. Both regional and large banks have taken losses on loans given\ndelinquencies on subprime auto loans. JPMorgan’s CEO, Jamie Dimon, warned when you see\none cockroach, there may be more likely. I’m curious how the Fed is looking at these loan losses\nand if it poses risks to the financial system or the outlook for the economy. Is it a warning sign?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, we’re—obviously we watch these things very carefully, credit\nconditions very carefully. You’re right—you’ve seen rising defaults in subprime credit for some\ntime now, and now you’ve seen a number of subprime credit—automobile credit institutions\nhaving significant losses, and some of those losses are now showing up on the books of banks.\nWe’re looking at it carefully, we’re paying close attention. I don’t see, at this point, a broader\ncredit issue. It doesn’t seem to be something that has very broad application across financial\ninstitutions. But we’re going to be—we’re going to be monitoring this quite carefully and\nmaking sure that that is the case.\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. And then, separately, many—you yourself have said that\nwe’re in a bifurcated economy right now with high-net-worth individuals continuing to spend,\nwith the lower income pulling back. How much of consumer spending continuing hinges on the\nstock market remaining strong? In some odd way, does the market help keep the economy\nbuoyant?\nPage 27 of 28\nOctober 29, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. So there is some—there is some relationship there, but, remember,\nthe more wealth someone has, the lower an additional dollar of wealth matters. So your marginal\npropensity to consume declines quite dramatically as you reach—as you reach levels of stock\nmarket wealth. So the stock market—it would affect spending if the stock market went down,\nbut it wouldn’t drop—it wouldn’t drop sharply unless there were quite a sharp drop in the stock\nmarket. People at the lower end of income and wealth have a much higher marginal propensity\nto consume an incremental dollar of income or wealth, but they don’t have the stock market\nwealth. So I think it’s certainly a factor supporting consumption right now, but—and you would\nsee it if you saw material corrections in spending. But it wouldn’t be—you shouldn’t think that\nit’ll, dollar for dollar, stop consumption, because that wouldn’t be the case.\nThanks very much.\nPage 28 of 28"

    "press_conf": "December 10, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nTranscript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference\nDecember 10, 2025\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on\nachieving our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of\nthe American people. Although important federal government data for the past couple of months\nhave yet to be released, available public- and private-sector data suggest that the outlook for\nemployment and inflation has not changed much since our meeting in October. Conditions in the\nlabor market appear to be gradually cooling, and inflation remains somewhat elevated.\nIn support of our goals, and in light of the balance of risks to employment and inflation,\ntoday the Federal Open Market Committee decided to lower our policy interest rate by\n¼ percentage point. As a separate matter, we also decided to initiate purchases of shorter-term\nTreasury securities solely for the purpose of maintaining an ample supply of reserves over time,\nthus supporting effective control of our policy rate. I will have more to say about monetary\npolicy and its implementation after briefly reviewing economic developments.\nAlthough some key government data have yet to be released, available indicators suggest\nthat economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace. Consumer spending appears to\nhave remained solid, and business fixed investment has continued to expand. In contrast,\nactivity in the housing sector remains weak. The temporary shutdown of the federal government\nhas likely weighed on economic activity in the current quarter, but these effects should be mostly\noffset by higher growth next quarter, reflecting the reopening. In our Summary of Economic\nProjections, the median participant projects that real GDP will rise 1.7 percent this year and\n2.3 percent next year, somewhat stronger than projected in September.\nIn the labor market, although official employment data for October and November are\ndelayed, available evidence suggests that both layoffs and hiring remain low, and that both\nPage 1 of 27\nDecember 10, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nhouseholds’ perceptions of job availability and firms’ perceptions of hiring difficulty continue to\ndecline. The official report on the labor market for September, the most recent release, showed\nthat the unemployment rate continued to edge up, reaching 4.4 percent, and that job gains had\nslowed significantly since earlier in the year. A good part of the slowing likely reflects a decline\nin the growth of the labor force due to lower immigration and labor force participation, though\nlabor demand has clearly softened as well. In this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor\nmarket, the downside risks to employment appear to have risen in recent months. In our SEP,\nthe median projection of the unemployment rate is 4.5 percent at the end of this year and edges\ndown thereafter.\nInflation has eased significantly from its highs in mid-2022 but remains somewhat\nelevated relative to our 2 percent longer-run goal. Very little data on inflation have been\nreleased since our meeting in October. Total PCE prices rose 2.8 percent over the 12 months\nending in September, and, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices\nalso rose 2.8 percent. These readings are higher than earlier in the year, as inflation for goods\nhas picked up, reflecting the effects of tariffs. In contrast, disinflation appears to be continuing\nfor services. Near-term measures of inflation expectations have declined from their peaks earlier\nin the year, as reflected in both market- and survey-based measures. Most measures of longer-\nterm expectations remain consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal. The median projection in\nthe SEP for total PCE inflation is 2.9 percent this year and 2.4 percent next year, a bit lower than\nthe median projection in September. Thereafter, the median falls to 2 percent.\nOur monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people. At today’s meeting, the Committee\nPage 2 of 27\nDecember 10, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ndecided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point to 3½ to\n3¾ percent.\nIn the near term, risks to inflation are tilted to the upside and risks to employment to the\ndownside—a challenging situation. There is no risk-free path for policy as we navigate this\ntension between our employment and inflation goals. A reasonable base case is that the effects\nof tariffs on inflation will be relatively short lived—effectively a one-time shift in the price level.\nOur obligation is to make sure that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an\nongoing inflation problem. But, with downside risks to employment having risen in recent\nmonths, the balance of risks has shifted. Our framework calls for us to take a balanced approach\nin promoting both sides of our dual mandate. Accordingly, we judged it appropriate at this\nmeeting to lower our policy rate by ¼ percentage point.\nWith today’s decision, we have lowered our policy rate ¾ percentage point over our last\nthree meetings. This further normalization of our policy stance should help stabilize the labor\nmarket while allowing inflation to resume its downward trend toward 2 percent once the effects\nof tariffs have passed through. The adjustments to our policy stance since September bring it\nwithin a range of plausible estimates of neutral and leave us well positioned to determine the\nextent and timing of additional adjustments to our policy rate based on the incoming data, the\nevolving outlook, and the balance of risks.\nIn our Summary of Economic Projections, FOMC participants wrote down their\nindividual assessments of an appropriate path of the federal funds rate under what each\nparticipant judges to be the most likely scenario for the economy. The median participant\nprojects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 3.4 percent at the end of 2026\nand 3.1 percent at the end of 2027, unchanged from September. As is always the case, these\nPage 3 of 27\nDecember 10, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nindividual forecasts are subject to uncertainty, and they are not a Committee plan or decision.\nMonetary policy is not on a preset course, and we will make our decisions on a meeting-by-\nmeeting basis.\nLet me turn now to issues related to the implementation of monetary policy, with the\nreminder that these issues are separate from—and have no implications for—the stance of\nmonetary policy. In light of the continued tightening in money market interest rates relative to\nour administered rates, and other indicators of reserve market conditions, the Committee judged\nthat reserve balances have declined to ample levels. Accordingly, at today’s meeting, the\nCommittee decided to initiate purchases of shorter-term Treasury securities—mainly Treasury\nbills—for the sole purpose of maintaining an ample supply of reserves over time. Such increases\nin our securities holdings ensure that the federal funds rate remains within its target range and are\nnecessary because the growth of the economy leads to rising demand over time for our liabilities,\nincluding currency and reserves. As detailed in a statement released today by the Federal\nReserve Bank of New York, reserve management purchases will amount to $40 billion in the\nfirst month and may remain elevated for a few months to alleviate expected near-term pressures\nin money markets. Thereafter, we expect the size of reserve management purchases to decline,\nthough the actual pace will depend on market conditions.\nIn our implementation framework, an ample supply of reserves means that the federal\nfunds rate and other short-term interest rates are primarily controlled by the setting of our\nadministered rates rather than day-to-day discretionary interventions in money markets. In this\nregime, standing repurchase agreement, or repo, operations are a critical tool to ensure that the\nfederal funds rate remains within its target range, even on days of elevated pressures in money\nmarkets. Consistent with this view, the Committee eliminated the aggregate limit on standing\nPage 4 of 27\nDecember 10, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nrepo operations. These operations are intended to support monetary policy implementation and\nsmooth market functioning and should be used when economically sensible.\nTo conclude: The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy: maximum\nemployment and stable prices. We remain committed to supporting maximum employment,\nbringing inflation sustainably to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer-term inflation\nexpectations well anchored. Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans.\nWe understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.\nEverything we do is in service to our public mission. At the Fed, we will do everything we can\nto achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals. Thank you. And I look forward\nto your questions.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Howard.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thank you. Howard Schneider, with Reuters. Just first\nturning to the statement, just to be clear we’re on the same page here, the insertion of the phrase\n“In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments”—does that indicate that the Fed\nis now on hold until there’s some clearer signal from inflation or jobs or the evolution of the\neconomy along the baseline outlook?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, yes, the adjustments since September bring our policy within a\nbroad range of estimates of neutral. And as we noted in our statement today, we are well\npositioned to determine the extent and timing of additional adjustments based on the incoming\ndata, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. That new language points out that we’ll\ncarefully evaluate that incoming data. And, also, I would note that having reduced our policy\nrate by 75 basis points since September and 175 basis points since last September, the fed funds\nPage 5 of 27\nDecember 10, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nrate is now within a broad range of estimates of its neutral value, and we are well positioned to\nwait to see how the economy evolves.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. And if I could follow up on the outlook there: It seems like\nwith the additional GDP growth coupled with easing inflation and a fairly steady unemployment\nrate, this seems like a pretty optimistic outlook for next year. What’s given rise to that? Is this\nan early bet on AI? Is there some sense of improving productivity out there? What’s driving\nthat?\nCHAIR POWELL. So a number of things are driving what’s happening in the forecast.\nAnd I would say, if you look broadly at outside forecasts, you do see a pickup in growth in many\nof those now, too. So it is—it’s partly that consumer spending has held up. It’s been resilient.\nTo another degree, it is that AI—spending on data centers and related to AI has been holding up\nbusiness investment. So, overall, the baseline expectation for next year is, at least at the Fed and\nI think with outside forecasters, too, is a pickup in growth from today’s relatively low level of\n1.7 percent. I mentioned that the SEP median is 1.7 for this year—growth—and 2.3 for next\nyear. Yet actually—some of that is due to the shutdown. So you can take two-tenths out of 2026\nand put it in 2025. So it would really be 1.9 and 2.1. But, overall, yes, you know, for a few\nreasons. Fiscal policy is going to be supportive. And, as I mentioned, AI spending will\ncontinue. The consumer continues to spend. So it looks like the baseline would be solid growth\nnext year.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking our questions here. You had\npreviously described rate cuts in terms of a risk-management framework. And, kind of following\nPage 6 of 27\nDecember 10, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nup on what Howard was asking, is the risk-management phase of rate cuts over here, and have\nyou taken out sufficient insurance, I guess, against potential weakness in terms of the data we\nmight get next week when it comes to employment?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we’re going to get a great deal of data between now and the\nJanuary meeting. And I’m sure we’ll talk more about that. And that will—the data that we get\nare going to factor into our thinking. But, yes, we have—if you go back, we held our policy rate\nat, you know, 5.4 percent for more than a year because inflation was high, very high, and\nunemployment—and the labor market was really solid at that point. So what happened is, over\nlast summer—summer of ’24—inflation came down and the labor market began to show real\nsigns of weakness. And so we decided, as our framework tells us to do, that when the risks to\nthe two goals become more equal, you should move from a stance that favors really dealing with\none of them—in that case, inflation—to a more balanced, more neutral setting. And so we did\nthat, and we did some cutting. And then we paused for a while to work our way through what\nwas happening in the middle of the year. And then we resumed cuts in September. And we’ve\ncut now three—we’ve now cut a total of 175 basis points. And, as I mentioned, you know, we\nfeel like where we’re positioned now puts—we’re well positioned to wait and see how the\neconomy evolves from here.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. If I could just follow up on the SEP. You have a whole lot of—big\nincrease in the growth numbers, but not a big decline in the unemployment numbers. And is that\nan AI factor in there? What is going on in terms of the dynamic of you get more growth, but you\ndon’t get a whole lot of decline in unemployment? Thank you, sir.\nCHAIR POWELL. So it is—the implication is obviously higher productivity. And some\nof that may be AI. It just—also, I think productivity has just been almost structurally higher for\nPage 7 of 27\nDecember 10, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nseveral years now. So if you start thinking of it as 2 percent per year, you can sustain higher\ngrowth without more job creation. Of course, higher productivity is also what enables incomes\nto rise over long periods of time, so it’s basically a good thing. But that may be—that’s certainly\nthe implication.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Colby.\nCOLBY SMITH. Thank you. Colby Smith with the New York Times. Today’s decision\nwas clearly very divided. It wasn’t just the two official dissents against the cut, but there were\nalso soft dissents from four others. And I’m just wondering if this reluctance from several\npeople to support recent reductions suggests that there is a much higher bar for cuts in the near\nterm, and what exactly does the Committee need to see if things are well positioned right now to\nsupport a January reduction?\nCHAIR POWELL. Sure. So let me just say, as I mentioned—and as I’ve mentioned\nhere before—the situation is that our two goals are a bit in tension, right? So, interestingly,\neveryone around the table at the FOMC agrees that inflation is too high and that we want it to\ncome down and agrees that the labor market has softened and that there’s further risk. Everyone\nagrees on that. Where the difference is is, how do you weight those risks and what does your\nforecast look like and where do—ultimately, where do you think the bigger risk is? And, you\nknow, it’s very unusual to have persistent tension between the two parts of the mandate. And\nwhen you do, this is what you see. And I think it’s actually what you would expect to see. And\nwe do see it.\nMeanwhile, the discussions we have are as good as any we’ve had in my 14 years at the\nFed. They’re very thoughtful, respectful. And you just have people who have strong views.\nAnd, you know, we come together and we reach—we reach, you know, a place where we can\nPage 8 of 27\nDecember 10, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nmake a decision. We made a decision today. We had—you know, 9 out of 12 supported it. So\nfairly broad support. But it’s not like the normal situation where everyone agrees on the\ndirection and what to do. It’s more—it’s more spread out. And I think that’s only inherent in the\nsituation.\nIn terms of what it would take, you know, we all have an outlook in terms of what’s\ngoing to come, but I think, ultimately, having cut 75 and, you know, the effects of the 75 basis\npoints will only begin to be coming in. As I’ve said before a couple of times, we’re well\npositioned to wait to see how the economy evolves. We’ll just have to see. And we will get, as\nyou know, quite a bit of data. I should mention on the data, as long as I’m talking about it, that\nwe’re going to need to be careful in assessing particularly the household survey data. There are\nvery technical reasons about the way data are collected in some of these measures, both in, you\nknow, inflation and in labor—in the labor market, so that the data may be distorted. And not just\nsort of more volatile, but distorted. And that’s—and that’s really because data was not collected\nin October and half of November. So we’re going to get data, but we’re going to have to look at\nit carefully and with a somewhat skeptical eye by the time of the January meeting.\nNotwithstanding that, we will have a lot of the December data by the time of the January\nmeeting. So we expect to see a lot more, but I’m just saying that the—what we get for, for\nexample, CPI or for the, you know, household survey, we’re going to look—we’re going to look\nat that really carefully and understand that it may be distorted by very technical factors.\nCOLBY SMITH. And just one more question on dissents. I mean, you talk about it in a\nvery positive way just given the complicated nature of the situation we’re in economically. But\nis there any point in which those dissents become counterproductive either to, you know, the\nFed’s communication and the messaging around the policy path forward?\nPage 9 of 27\nDecember 10, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. I wouldn’t—I don’t feel that we’re at that point at all. I don’t. I\nwould say, again, these are good, thoughtful, respectful discussions. And you hear people say—\nand you’ll hear many outside analysts say the same thing. I could make a case for either side. I\nmean, I could make that case. It’s a close call. We have to make decisions, and we—you know,\nwe always hope that the data will give us a clear read. But in this situation, you have\ncompeting—if you look—if you look through the SEP, you’ll see that a very large number of\nparticipants agree that risks are to the upside for unemployment and to the upside for inflation.\nSo what do you do? You’ve got one tool. You can’t do two things at once. So at what pace do\nyou move? How, how—what size moves do you make and that kind of thing. And what’s the\ntiming of them? It’s very—it’s a very challenging situation. I think we’re in a good place to, as\nI mentioned, to wait and see how the economy evolves.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nick.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, there’s\nbeen some discussion recently of the 1990s. In the 1990s, the Committee did two discrete\nsequences of three quarter-point cuts, one in 1995–96 and one in 1998. And after both of those,\nthe next move in rates was up, not down. With policy now closer to neutral, is it a foregone\nconclusion that the next move in rates is down, or should we think of policy risks as genuinely\ntwo-sided from here?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I don’t think that a rate hike is anybody’s base as the next thing—\nis anybody’s base case at this point. And I’m not hearing that. What you see is some people feel\nwe should stop here and that we’re at the right place and just wait. Some people feel like we\nshould cut once or more this year and next year. But the—but when people are writing down\ntheir estimates of policy of where it should go, it is either holding here or cutting a little or\nPage 10 of 27\nDecember 10, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ncutting more than a little. So I don’t see that as—I don’t see the base case as involving that. So,\nof course, you know, a data set of two, now three, is not a big data set. But you are right about\nthose two three-cut times in the ’90s.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. If I could follow up: The unemployment rate has been rising very\ngradually for the better part of two years. And, indeed, the statement today no longer describes\nthe unemployment rate as remaining low. What gives you confidence it won’t continue rising in\n2026, especially when housing and other rate-sensitive sectors still appear to be feeling\nrestrictive policy from the—notwithstanding the 150 basis points in cuts prior to today?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, yeah, the idea is that with now having cut 75 basis points more\nnow and having policy, you know, I’d call it in a broad range of plausible estimates of neutral,\nthat that will be a place which will enable the labor market to stabilize or to only kick up one or\ntwo more tenths. But we won’t see, you know, any kind of a sharper downturn, which we\nhaven’t seen any evidence of at all. At the same time, policy is still in a place where it’s not\naccommodative, and we feel like—we feel like we have made progress this year in nontariff-\nrelated inflation. And as tariffs come through, as they flow through, that’ll show through next\nyear. But, as I said, we’re well past—well placed to wait and see how that turns out. That is our\nexpectation, but, you know, we’re going to start to see the data, and it’ll tell us whether we were\nright or not.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Claire.\nCLAIRE JONES. Claire Jones, Financial Times. A lot of people interpreted your\ncomments at the October meeting that, you know, when there’s a foggy situation we slow down\nto mean that, you know, there won’t be a cut now, there’ll be a cut in January instead. So it’d be\nPage 11 of 27\nDecember 10, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ngood to get a sense of why did the Committee decide to move today rather than to move in\nJanuary instead. Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Right. So in October, I said that there was no certainty of moving.\nAnd that was indeed correct. I said it’s possible you could think about it that way, but I was\ncareful to say other people could look at it differently. So why did we move today? You know, I\nwould say—point to a couple of things. First of all, gradual cooling in the labor market has\ncontinued. Unemployment is now up three-tenths from June through September. Payroll jobs\naveraging 40,000 per month since April. We think there’s an overstatement in these numbers by\nabout 60,000, so that would be negative 20,000 per month. And also, just to point out one other\nthing, surveys of households and businesses both showed declining supply and demand for\nworkers, so I think you can say that the labor market has continued to cool gradually, maybe just\na touch more gradually than we thought.\nYou know, in terms of inflation, we are—it’s come in a touch lower. And I think the\nevidence is kind of growing that what’s happening here is services inflation coming down, and\nthat’s offset by increases in goods, and that goods inflation is entirely in sectors where there are\ntariffs. So that does build on the story. And so far, it’s only a story that this is—that the goods\ninflation, which is really the source of the excess at this point, that that—almost more than half\nthe source of the excess inflation is goods—is tariffs. And you’ve got to say then, “So what do\nwe expect from tariffs?” And it’s—I would say that is, to some extent, down to looking for\nbroader economic, you know, heat. You know, do we see a hot economy? Do we see\nconstraints? Do we see what’s going on with wages? You saw the ECI report today. It doesn’t\nfeel like a hot economy that wants to generate, you know, a Phillips curve kind of inflation. So\nPage 12 of 27\nDecember 10, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nwe look at all those things, and we say that this was a decision to make. Obviously, it wasn’t\nunanimous. But, overall, that was the judgment that we made, and that’s the action we took.\nCLAIRE JONES. Just on the ample-reserves point, how concerned were people around\nthe table about some of the tensions we’ve seen in money markets? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, I wouldn’t say “concerned.” So what really happened is this:\nBalance sheet shrinkage, sometimes called QT, went on. We had a framework in place for\nmonitoring it, and nothing happened. The overnight reverse repo facility went down pretty much\nclose to zero. And then, beginning in mid-September, the federal funds rate started to tick up\nwithin the range, right? And it ticked up almost all the way to interest on reserve balances.\nThere’s nothing wrong with that. What that’s telling you is that we’re actually in a reserves—in\nan ample-reserves regime. So, you know, we knew this was going to come. When it finally did\ncome, it came a little quicker than expected, but we were, yeah, absolutely there to take the\nactions that we said we would take. And those actions are today. So, you know, we announced\nthat we’re resuming reserve management purchases. That is completely separate from monetary\npolicy. It’s just we need to keep an ample supply of reserves out there. Why so big? The\nanswer to that is, you know, if you look ahead, you will see that April 15th is coming up, and our\nframework is such that we want to have ample reserves even at times when reserves are at a low\nlevel temporarily. So that’s what happens on Tax Day. People pay a lot of money to the\ngovernment, reserves drop sharply and temporarily. So this seasonal buildup that we’ll see in the\nnext few months was going to happen anyway. It was going to happen because April 15th is\nApril 15th. There’s also a secular ongoing growth of the balance sheet. We have to keep\nreserves, call it, constant as a—as it relates to the banking system or to the whole economy. And\nthat alone calls for us to increase about $20 [or] $25 billion per month. So that’s a small part.\nPage 13 of 27\nDecember 10, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nThat’s going on. It’s also happening in the context of a temporary few month front-loading to\nget reserves high enough to get through the, you know, the tax period in mid-April. So that’s\nwhat’s happening there.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Andrew.\nANDREW ACKERMAN. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. This is the last post-FOMC press\nconference before an important Supreme Court hearing next month. Can you talk about how\nyou’re hoping the Supreme Court will rule? And I’m just curious why the Fed’s been so reticent\non such a pivotal matter.\nCHAIR POWELL. It’s not something I want to address here, Andrew. You know, we’re\nnot legal commentators. It’s before the courts, and we think our—we don’t think that we help\nmatters by trying to engage as a public discussant of that. I’ll give you a mulligan, though.\nANDREW ACKERMAN. Thanks. I don’t know if that means I get three questions,\nbut—\nCHAIR POWELL. No, just one, just one more. [Laughter]\nANDREW ACKERMAN. I guess I wanted to come back to the 1990s question. Like,\ndo you see that as a useful model for thinking about what is happening in the economy right\nnow?\nCHAIR POWELL. I don’t think it rises to that level. So I did think that in 2019, when\nwe cut three times. But, you know, this is such a unique situation. This is—it’s not the 1970s,\nlet’s put it that way. But we do have tension between our two goals. And so that’s just unique in\nmy time at the Fed and I think going back a long ways. We haven’t had that in our framework.\nOur framework, as you know, says that when that’s the case, that we try to, you know, take a\nbalanced approach to the two things. We look at how far they are and how long it would take to\nPage 14 of 27\nDecember 10, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nget them back to—each of them back to the goal. And that’s a very subjective analysis, really.\nBut it just tells you you’ve got to—and I think, ultimately, what it says is, when they’re broadly\nequally threatened or equally at risk, you should be kind of neutral because if you’re either\naccommodative or tight, you’re favoring one or the other goal. And so we’ve been trying to—\nwe’ve been sort of moving in the direction of neutral. Now we’re in the range of neutral. We’re\nin the high end of the range of neutral, I would say. And that’s what we’re doing now. It so\nhappened that we’ve cut three times. You know, we haven’t made any decision about January.\nBut, as I’ve said, we think we’re well positioned to wait and see how the economy performs.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Edward.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Edward Lawrence, with Fox\nBusiness. I wanted to ask you, the inflation expectations has come down in your SEP report. Do\nyou see the tariff price increases as passing through in the next three months? Is it a six-month\nprocess that we’re looking for that to end? And then, because of that, is jobs the threat to the\neconomy?\nCHAIR POWELL. So with tariff inflation, you know, it takes—there’s the\nannouncement of a tariff and then there’s—you know, they start to take effect. And then it takes\nsome months. Goods may have to be shipped from other parts of the—you know, it may take,\nyou know, quite a while for an individual tariff to take its full effect. But once it’s had that\neffect, then the question is, isn’t that just a one-time price increase? So we’ve actually—we\nactually look at all of the announcements. And what you get from all that, you see sort of a—for\neach one of them, there’s a time period and then it’s fully in. So if there are no new tariff\nannouncements—and we don’t know that, but let’s assume there are no major new tariff\nannouncements—inflation from goods should peak in the first quarter or so, right? Or roughly.\nPage 15 of 27\nDecember 10, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nYou know, we haven’t been able to predict this with any precision. No one is. But call it the\nfirst quarter or so of next year should be the peak. And from here, it should be—it shouldn’t be\nbig, it should be a couple tenths or even less than that. We don’t really have precision on this.\nAnd, after that, again, if there are no new tariffs that are being announced that will take nine\nmonths to get fully in—and nine months is also an estimate—then you should start to see that\ncoming down in the back half of next year.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. And I wanted to see if I could address sort of the elephant in\nthe room. The President’s been talking openly about a new Fed Chairman. Does that hinder\nyour current job right now or change your thinking at all?\nCHAIR POWELL. No.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Mike.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. No mulligans for Ed. [Laughter] Michael McKee from\nBloomberg Radio and Television. Ten-year rates have—are 50 basis points higher than when\nyou started cutting back in September of 2024, and the yield curve basically has been steepening.\nWhy do you think that continuing to cut now, especially in the absence of data, is going to bring\ndown the yield on the thing that will move the economy the most?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we’re looking at the real economy and focusing on that. And you\nhave—you’ve got—when the long bonds move around, you’ve got to look at why they’re\nmoving around. If you look at inflation compensation, it’s very—that’s one part of it is inflation\ncompensation breakevens, and, you know, they’re at very comfortable levels. They’re at levels\nconsistent—past—once you get out past the very short term now, breakevens are at a, you know,\nat quite—levels that are quite consistent with 2 percent inflation over time. So there’s nothing\nhappening with rates going up out there that suggests concern about inflation in the long term or\nPage 16 of 27\nDecember 10, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nanything like that. I mean, I look at these things pretty regularly. Same thing with surveys.\nSurveys are all saying that the public understands our commitment to 2 percent and expects us to\nget back there. So why are rates going up? It has to be something else. It must be, you know,\nan expectation of higher growth or something like that. And that’s a lot of what’s been going on.\nI mean, you saw a big move, you know, toward the end of last year, which was not to do with us,\nit was to do with other developments.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Well, you just mentioned that we’re—the public is expecting you\nto get back to 2 percent. And Americans, overwhelmingly, are citing high prices, inflation, as\ntheir number one concern. Can you explain to them why you’re prioritizing the labor market,\nwhich seems relatively stable to most people, instead of their number-one concern, inflation?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we—as you know, we have a network of contacts in the U.S.\neconomy which is really unmatched if you go through the 12 Reserve Banks. So we hear loud\nand clear how people are experiencing, really, costs. It’s really high costs. And a lot of that is\nnot the current rate of inflation. A lot of that is just embedded higher cost due to higher inflation\nin 2022 and ’23. So that’s what’s going on. And so the best thing we can do is restore inflation\nto its 2 percent goal—and our policy is intended to do that—but also have a strong economy\nwhere real wages are going up, where people are getting jobs and earning money. And they’re—\nwe’re going to need to have some years where real compensation is higher, you know, it’s\npositive, significantly positive, so wages—nominal wages are higher than inflation for people to\nstart feeling good about affordability—the affordability issue. And, you know, so we’re working\nhard on that. We want to—we’re trying to keep inflation under control but also support the labor\nmarket and strong wages so that people are earning enough money and feeling economically\nhealthy again.\nPage 17 of 27\nDecember 10, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMICHELLE SMITH. Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi. Victoria Guida with Politico. Just to follow up on that, I\nmean, this is now the third time that you’ve cut this year, and inflation is around 3 percent. So is\nthe message that you’re sort of trying to send with that that you’re okay with where inflation is\nfor now as long as people understand that, at some point, you still want to get back to 2 percent\nbecause inflation is relatively stable where it is?\nCHAIR POWELL. Everyone should understand, and the surveys show that they do, that\nwe’re committed to 2 percent inflation and we will deliver 2 percent inflation. But it’s a\ncomplicated, unusual, difficult situation where the labor market is also under pressure, where job\ncreation may actually be negative. Now, supply of workers has also gone way down, so the\nunemployment rate hasn’t moved that much. But, you know, it’s a labor market that seems to\nhave significant downside risks. People care a lot about that. That’s their jobs, that’s their\nability, if they get laid off or if they’re entering the labor force, to find work. So that’s really\nimportant to people.\nThe story with inflation—and, you know, we’re well aware that this is a story at this\npoint—is that if you get away from tariffs, inflation is in the low 2s, right? So it’s really tariffs\nthat’s causing the—most of the inflation overshoot. And we do think of those as likely to, in the\ncurrent situation, as likely to be a one-time, you know, one-time price increase. Our job is to\nmake sure that it is, and we will do that job. But, right now, you’ve got this difficult balance,\nand there are risks to both sides. There’s no risk-free path. If we were—if we—you know, if it\nwas just inflation and the labor market was just really strong and then we’d—rates would be\nhigher, as they were for more than a year. You know, we didn’t have to worry about inflation—\nsorry, about the labor market, because the labor market, unemployment was very low, if you\nPage 18 of 27\nDecember 10, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nremember, when inflation was very high. There was a labor shortage, so we could focus entirely\non inflation. Now it’s different. We actually have risks to both. And I think we’re doing the\nbest we can for people. They also care about their jobs. They do care about affordability. And\nthe best thing we can do there is both to support economic activity but also, you know, make sure\nthat when tariff inflation goes down and disappears, inflation lands around 2 percent.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Elizabeth.\nELIZABETH SCHULZE. Thanks so much. Elizabeth Schulze, with ABC News. Just to\nfollow up, you keep talking about job growth being negative. Why do you think job growth is so\nmuch worse than all the official data? Why do you think job growth is—to follow up on your\ncomments about job growth, why is it so much worse than the official data is suggesting?\nCHAIR POWELL. Oh, well, we just—we know, I think. It’s, it’s—this is—I don’t think\nthis is particularly controversial. There’s a—it’s very difficult to estimate job growth in real\ntime. They don’t count everybody. They have a survey. And there’s been something of a\nsystematic overcount. And so we expect it and they correct it twice a year. So the last time they\ncorrected it, we thought the correction would be 800,000 or 900,000. I won’t get the numbers\nexactly right. And that was exactly what happened. So we think that that has persisted. And so\nthere was an overcount in the payroll job numbers, we think, continuing. And it will be\ncorrected. I don’t have the exact month in my head right now. But—and that’s just—I don’t—\nagain, I think forecasters generally understand that. So—and we think it’s about 60,000 a month,\nso 40,000 jobs could be negative 20. And, you know, that could be wrong by 10 or 20 in either\ndirection. But, in any case—but the thing is, that’s, that’s job creation, in a way, that’s demand.\nLabor supply has also come down quite sharply. So, you know, if you had a world where they’re\njust—there’s just no growth in workers and you really don’t need a lot of jobs to have full\nPage 19 of 27\nDecember 10, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nemployment, some people argue that’s what we’re looking at. But I think a world where job\ncreation is negative, I just think we need to watch that situation very carefully and be in a\nposition where we’re not, you know, pushing down on job creation with our policy.\nELIZABETH SCHULZE. When we’re talking about supply, we have seen major\nAmerican employers like Amazon cite AI in job cuts. How much right now are you factoring in\nAI into the current weakness in the job market?\nCHAIR POWELL. So it’s probably part of the story. It’s not a big part of the story yet.\nWe don’t know whether it will be. But, you know, for example, if you look at—you can’t miss\nthe big announcements of layoffs and also companies saying that they’re not going to hire\nanybody for a long time, and they cite AI—that’s all clearly happening. At the same time,\npeople are not filing for unemployment insurance. And since job creation—job-finding rates are\nextremely low, if there were big numbers of layoffs, you’d expect the continuing claims to go up,\nand you’d expect new claims to go up, but they really haven’t much. So it’s a little bit curious.\nBut longer term, though, you know, the question is, what are we going to see here? And we\ndon’t know. But it’s—you know, there’s a—it may be that, in past technology, really significant\ntechnology and innovation eras, you have seen some jobs destroyed and other jobs made.\nUltimately, what’s happened for a couple hundred years is, when you get through all that, you\nhave higher productivity, and you have new jobs, and there are enough jobs for people. This is\na—this may be different. You know, it’s—every time we have a wave of technology, we think,\n“Oh, this could put a lot of people out of work. What are they going to do?” In the past, there’s\nalways been more work and higher productivity, and incomes have risen. What will happen\nhere? We’re going to have to see. But right now is such early days, we don’t think we see\nmuch—it’s certainly not showing up in layoffs yet.\nPage 20 of 27\nDecember 10, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMICHELLE SMITH. Enda.\nENDA CURRAN. Thank you, Chair. Enda Curran, Bloomberg News. Given the\nbreadth of views on the policy Committee, why is there such a division of views between the—\nCHAIR POWELL. On the policy what?\nENDA CURRAN. On the Committee.\nCHAIR POWELL. Thank you.\nENDA CURRAN. Why is there such a division of views between the presidents and the\nBoard members?\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, it’s not so stark as that. The views are more varied on\neach—in each group as well. There’s some of that, but I would say there are also Governors and\nthere are people in both—on both sides in both groups. So I wouldn’t put too much in that.\nENDA CURRAN. Okay. And just to follow up, given your growth upgrade, how would\nyou factor in or what would be the economic impact if the Supreme Court is to strike down the\ntariffs that they’re currently hearing in terms of growth and inflation? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. I really don’t know. It would depend on—it would depend on a\nwhole bunch of things we don’t know. So I can’t really help you there.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Christine.\nCHRISTINE ROMANS. Thank you. Thank you, Chair Powell. Christine Romans,\nNBC News. I wanted to ask you about how the higher-income households are really driving\nspending right now. They’re backed by home equity and stock market wealth. But lower-\nincome consumers are really struggling with the accumulation of five years now of rising prices.\nIt’s price levels, not really the inflation rate, holding some of these families back. How\nPage 21 of 27\nDecember 10, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nsustainable is this so-called K-shaped economy? And what are the Fed’s thoughts on whether\nthat’s a risk going forward?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we do, through our vast network of contacts and just through our\nobservation of what’s going on in the economy, we hear about this a lot. If you listen to the\nearnings reports for consumer-facing companies that tend to deal with low- and moderate-\nincome people, they’ll all say that we’re seeing people, you know, tightening their belts, you\nknow, changing products that they buy, buying less and that sort of thing. And so it’s clearly a\nthing. It’s also clearly a thing that, you know, asset values, housing values, and securities values\nare high, and they tend to be owned by people more at the higher end of the income and wealth.\nAnd so, as to how sustainable it is, I don’t know. Most of the consumption does happen by\npeople who have more means. I think, you know, the top third accounts for way more than a\nthird of the consumption, for example. So it’s a good question how sustainable that is. You\nknow, the best we can do is to have, you know, price stability and a strong labor market. And\nwhat we saw—for example, what we saw at the end of the, you know, the very, very long\nexpansion that ended with the outbreak of the pandemic, we saw that it was 10 years and\n8 months or something like that—the longest one in recorded history. In the last two years, most\nof the job—the largest part of the wage gains were going to people in the bottom quartile, the\nbottom part of the low and moderate income. So, you know, having a strong labor market for a\nlong period of time is really, really good from a social standpoint. It’s helping people at the\nlower-income levels, and that’s what we all want to get back to. But we’ve got to have price\nstability, and we’ve got to have, you know, full employment, maximum employment.\nCHRISTINE ROMANS. And, just quickly, you mentioned the housing market remains\nkind of weak. With these rate cuts that we’ve seen, is there a chance we’re going to see more\nPage 22 of 27\nDecember 10, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\naffordability in the housing market so more people can maybe enjoy that part of wealth creation?\nI mean, the average age—the median age of a first-time homebuyer is now 40 years old. That’s\nthe highest on record.\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah, so the housing market faces some really significant challenges.\nAnd I don’t know that, you know, a 25 basis point decline in the federal funds rate is going to\nmake much of a difference for people. You know, housing supply is low. Many people have\nvery, very low-rate mortgages from the pandemic period, and they kept refinancing and caught\nthe really low. So it’s made it expensive for them to move. And, you know, we’re a ways away\nfrom that changing. Also, we’re just—we haven’t built enough housing in the country for a long\ntime, and so a lot of estimates suggest that we just need more housing of different kinds. So\nhousing is going to be a, you know, a problem. And, you know, really the tools to address it\nare—we can raise and lower interest rates, but we don’t really have the tools to address, you\nknow, a secular housing shortage—a structural housing shortage.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Chris.\nCHRIS RUGABER. Thanks. Chris Rugaber, Associated Press. You mentioned on\ninflation services inflation being low, goods inflation looking like maybe it’ll peak. We had the\nwages report you mentioned today showing moderating wage growth. Where are the inflation\nrisks? It looks like inflation is cooling in your view. At the same time, you have potentially\nnegative hiring. Why not—why aren’t we hearing more about maybe more cuts in this\nenvironment?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, I think the risk of inflation is pretty clear to see. And that is,\nyou know, we see higher inflation, as I mentioned. Most of the inflation over target is from\ngoods. And we think, we estimate, we expect—most of us—that inflation will be a one-time\nPage 23 of 27\nDecember 10, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nprice increase and then come down. We just came off an experience where inflation turned out\nto be much more persistent than anyone had expected. Is that going to happen now? You know,\nthat’s—so that’s the risk. The risk is either that tariff inflation just turns out to be more and more\npersistent, maybe because companies who are now holding back from passing through the tariffs\nwill just keep doing that. So you’ll see—you see that. I think the other possibility is less likely,\nand that is just that, you know, the labor market gets tight or the economy gets tight and you see,\nyou know, just traditional inflation. I don’t see that as particularly likely. But—so I think—you\nknow, again, you know, all across the Committee, people see the picture pretty similarly but see\nthe risks quite differently. And some people do see the inflation risk. And I wouldn’t dismiss\nthat case. I don’t dismiss that case. But you’ve got to make an assessment, and this is the\nassessment we made.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Neil.\nNEIL IRWIN. Hi, Chair Powell. Neil Irwin, with Axios. So this has come up a couple\nof times today, but to be clear, do you believe that we’re experiencing a positive productivity\nshock, whether from AI or policy factors or whatever? And how much of that is—how much is\nthat driving the higher GDP projection in the SEP?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, yeah, I mean, I never thought I would see a time when we had,\nyou know, five, six years of 2 percent productivity growth. This is higher. You know, this is\ndefinitely higher. And it was—before, it could be attributed to AI. I think you—I also think if\nyou look at what AI can do and if you use it in your personal life, as I imagine many of us have,\nyou can see the prospects for productivity. I think it makes people who use it more productive.\nIt may make other people have to find other jobs, though. So it could have productivity\nimplications while also having, you know, social and labor market implications that we don’t\nPage 24 of 27\nDecember 10, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nhave the tools to deal with. But, yes, I think we are seeing—we’re definitely seeing higher\nproductivity. I don’t—I think it’s a little quick to be saying it’s generative AI. But I don’t\nknow—you know, the pandemic may have induced people to do more automation and do more\nthings with computers to replace people. And that raises productivity, you know, output per\nhour.\nNEIL IRWIN. Does that imply a higher—does that imply a higher neutral rate and,\ntherefore, the policy might be a little easier than it seems?\nCHAIR POWELL. All—you know, all things equal, yes. But all things aren’t equal.\nThere are many, many things pushing in different directions on where the neutral rate would be.\nBut, yes, that argument does come up.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Matt Egan.\nMATT EGAN. Thanks, Chair Powell. Matt Egan, with CNN. After today, you only\nhave three more meetings at the helm of the Fed. Since becoming Fed Chair, you’ve seen\nmultiple trade wars, the pandemic, COVID reopening, a period of high inflation. I know your\nterm’s not up as Chair until May, but I’m wondering if you’ve given any thought to what you\nwant your legacy to be.\nCHAIR POWELL. My legacy. I—my thought is that I really want to turn this job over\nto whoever replaces me in—with the economy in really good shape. That’s what I want to do. I\nwant inflation to be under control, coming back down to 2 percent, and I want the labor market\nto be strong. That’s what I want. And all of my efforts are to get to that place. They have been\nall along, but, ultimately, that’s what I want. And it’s—you know, I don’t have time to think\nabout bigger things. I have, I hope, many years ahead to worry about that. But there’s enough to\ndo.\nPage 25 of 27\nDecember 10, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMATT EGAN. Relatedly, have you given any more thought and can you tell us any\nmore about your plans on whether or not you plan to stay on the Fed Board of Governors even\nafter your term as Chair expires?\nCHAIR POWELL. Again, I’m focused on—I’m focused on my remaining time as Chair.\nI haven’t got anything new on that to tell you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Mark for the last question.\nMARK HAMRICK. Chairman, Mark Hamrick, with Bankrate. Even while many price\nlevels remain elevated, the reductions in the federal funds rate means that savings rates—or\nyields, to be more precise—have peaked, while key borrowing rates remain elevated. And that’s,\nas we’ve discussed here, as many Americans struggle with liquidity or emergency savings\nchallenges. Is that just collateral damage or an unintended consequence because your tools are\nlimited in addressing individual or household liquidity constraints, insufficient money in the\nbank?\nCHAIR POWELL. I don’t know. I would—I wouldn’t agree that that’s collateral\ndamage of our—I mean, over time, we do what we do in order to create price stability and\nmaximum employment. And those things are hugely valuable to all of the people we serve.\nWhen we raise rates to bring inflation down, you know, that does work by slowing the economy,\nbut we’ve moved back our rate—our policy back down to where it’s not—it’s certainly not\nstrongly restrictive at this point. I think it’s sort of in the range of neutral. So that’s what we’re\ntrying to do. And I would want people to understand that. I think what people are feeling is the\neffect of higher prices. There was a global wave, sort of every large economy in the world—sort\nof every large open economy, market-based economy in the world had a wave of inflation that\nlooked an awful lot like ours. We actually came through better than any other country.\nPage 26 of 27\nDecember 10, 2025 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nSubstantially better. We had higher growth, we had a better labor market. And this is really due\nto the American economy. We have an extraordinary economy. You know, people are\ninnovative, they work hard. And so, you know, all of us who work in economics jobs are really\nfortunate to have the U.S. economy. So thank you very much.\nPage 27 of 27"

    "press_conf": "January 28, 2026 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nTranscript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference\nJanuary 28, 2026\nCHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on\nachieving our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of\nthe American people. The U.S. economy expanded at a solid pace last year and is coming into\n2026 on a firm footing. While job gains have remained low, the unemployment rate has shown\nsome signs of stabilization, and inflation remains somewhat elevated.\nIn support of our goals, today the Federal Open Market Committee decided to leave our\npolicy rate unchanged. Having lowered our policy rate by 75 basis points over the course of our\nprevious three meetings, we see the current stance of monetary policy as appropriate to promote\nprogress toward both our maximum-employment and 2 percent inflation goals. I will have more\nto say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.\nAvailable indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace.\nConsumer spending has been resilient, and business fixed investment has continued to expand.\nIn contrast, activity in the housing sector has remained weak. The temporary shutdown of the\nfederal government likely weighed on economic activity last quarter, but these effects should be\nreversed as the reopening boosts growth this quarter.\nIn the labor market, indicators suggest that conditions may be stabilizing after a period of\ngradual softening. The unemployment rate was 4.4 percent in December and has changed little\nin recent months. Job gains have remained low. Total nonfarm payrolls declined at an average\npace of 22,000 per month over the last three months; excluding government employment, private\npayrolls rose at an average pace of 29,000 per month. A good part of the slowing in the pace of\njob growth over the past year reflects a decline in the growth of the labor force due to lower\nimmigration and labor force participation, though labor demand has clearly softened as well.\nPage 1 of 24\nJanuary 28, 2026 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nOther indicators, including openings, layoffs, hiring, and nominal wage growth, show little\nchange in recent months.\nInflation has eased significantly from its highs in mid-2022 but remains somewhat\nelevated relative to our 2 percent longer-run goal. Estimates based on the consumer price index\nindicate that total PCE prices rose 2.9 percent over the 12 months ending in December and that,\nexcluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 3.0 percent. These\nelevated readings largely reflect inflation in the goods sector, which has been boosted by the\neffects of tariffs. In contrast, disinflation appears to be continuing in the services sector. Near-\nterm measures of inflation expectations have declined from last year’s peaks, as reflected in both\nmarket- and survey-based measures. Most measures of longer-term expectations remain\nconsistent with our 2 percent inflation goal.\nOur monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices for the American people. At today’s meeting, the Committee\ndecided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 3½ to 3¾ percent.\nSince last September, we have lowered our policy rate 75 basis points, or ¾ of\na percentage point, bringing it within a range of plausible estimates of neutral. This\nnormalization of our policy stance should help stabilize the labor market while allowing inflation\nto resume its downward trend toward 2 percent once the effects of tariff increases have passed\nthrough. We are well positioned to determine the extent and timing of additional adjustments to\nour policy rate based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.\nMonetary policy is not on a preset course, and we will make our decisions on a meeting-by-\nmeeting basis.\nPage 2 of 24\nJanuary 28, 2026 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nTo conclude, the Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy: maximum\nemployment and stable prices. We remain committed to supporting maximum employment,\nbringing inflation sustainably to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer-term inflation\nexpectations well anchored. Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans.\nWe at the Fed will continue to do our jobs with objectivity, integrity, and a deep commitment to\nserve the American people.\nThank you. I look forward to your questions.\nCHRIS RUGABER. Hi. Chris Rugaber at Associated Press. Thank you. I wanted to\nask—you attended the Supreme Court hearing last week on the Lisa Cook case, and Treasury\nSecretary Scott Bessent criticized that as political. Can you say why you attended and what you\nwould say in response to the secretary’s criticism?\nCHAIR POWELL. So let me start with, I don’t respond to comments by other officials,\nwhoever they may be. It’s just not appropriate to do that. I will tell you why I attended. I would\nsay that that case is perhaps the most important legal case in the Fed’s 113-year history. And as I\nthought about it, I thought it might be hard to explain why I didn’t attend. In addition, Paul\nVolcker went to a Supreme Court case famously in, I guess, 1985 or so, so it’s precedented, and I\nthought it was an appropriate thing, and I did it.\nCHRIS RUGABER. Great. And then just quickly follow on, the job market—you\nmentioned last month that the household survey might be distorted, and you also mentioned the\npotential for overcounting jobs, which would suggest that we’re still in a negative hiring pace.\nSo do you see the drop in the unemployment rate as solid? And I’m just—what’s the basis for\nsaying that things have stabilized? Thank you.\nPage 3 of 24\nJanuary 28, 2026 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. So, yeah, really two questions. One is—so we’re getting through the\ndistortions in the data from the shutdown. What—however big they were in November, they’re\nsmaller in December. So we’re getting to a place where they’re no longer material. They’re still\nthere, but it’s a tweak here and there. The reason why we—why we changed the statement, let\nme pull it out, was, was simply, it’s—it used to say that “judges the downside risks to\nemployment rose in recent months.” So we saw data coming in which suggests some signs of\nstabilization—I wouldn’t go too far with that, but some signs of stabilization. There are also\nsome signs of continued cooling. And so we thought that was no longer an accurate description\nof the data.\nIn addition, the outlook for economic activity has improved—clearly improved—since\nthe last meeting, and that should matter for labor demand and for employment over time. So, for\nthose two reasons, we thought we would take that language out of the statement.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nick.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, you’ve\ngenerally avoided engaging with political controversies directly, and the video statement on\nJanuary 11 was a departure. What made this different, and are you concerned it could draw the\ninstitution further into political debates?\nCHAIR POWELL. So today on—I’m simply going to refer you to the statement that I\nmade on January 11. I’m not going to expand on it or repeat it. So I’m just not going to—this is\nreally about the press conference and the economy and what we did today, but—and some\nancillaries. But I’m not going to be getting into that.\nNICK TIMIRAOS. Can you say whether the Fed has responded to the subpoenas?\nCHAIR POWELL. I have nothing for you on that today.\nPage 4 of 24\nJanuary 28, 2026 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMICHELLE SMITH. Mike.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio TV. Have you made a\ndecision on whether you would remain as a Governor of the Federal Reserve, and, if so, would\nyou tell us what it is? And, if not, when might we anticipate a decision?\nCHAIR POWELL. No, and I really, once again, have nothing for you on that today—\nthat either.\nMICHAEL MCKEE. Why would you want to leave at all, under the circumstances?\nCHAIR POWELL. Again, I don’t want to get into this. It’s not something I’m—there’s\na time and place for these questions, but not something I’m going to be getting into today.\nThank you.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Claire.\nCLAIRE JONES. Thank you. Claire Jones, Financial Times. Thanks a lot for taking my\nquestions—and another one that might lead to a similar answer.\nCHAIR POWELL. Give it a try.\nCLAIRE JONES. We’ve seen quite big movements in the dollar over recent days. What\ndo you think is driving the U.S. currency lower? And have you been at all concerned just by the\nextent of the volatility we’ve seen this week? Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So, Claire, as you probably know, we don’t comment on the dollar.\nReally, the Administration, and especially the Treasury Department, has the job of oversight over\nthe currency and exchange rates and all of that. We don’t comment on that. It’s not our—not\nour role. So I have nothing for you.\nCLAIRE JONES. But, I mean, what’s your view on the market movements? I mean,\nwhat do you think’s behind them? Is it asset managers diversifying? Is it—\nPage 5 of 24\nJanuary 28, 2026 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah, I just don’t—we don’t talk about the dollar. We don’t talk\nabout what moves it around. It’s just—it’s just not appropriate for us to do so. Really, the\nTreasury Department has that—it’s their, their role, their bailiwick, and we stay off it. We do\nmonetary policy and some other things, but we don’t—we don’t comment on the dollar. Sorry.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Neil.\nNEIL IRWIN. Hi, Chair Powell. Neil Irwin with Axios. Obviously no SEP in this\nmeeting, but in light of the slight firming up of the language around growth in the labor market\nin the statement, should we assume that the timeline for any further rate cuts is pushed back,\ncompared to what people might have thought in December?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, first of all, if you look at the incoming data since the last\nmeeting, clear improvement in the outlook for growth. The data have come in, and sentiment,\nthe Beige Book—everything—comes in suggesting that this year starts off on a solid footing for\ngrowth. Inflation performed about as expected, and, as I mentioned, some of the labor market\ndata came in suggesting evidence of stabilization. So it’s overall a stronger forecast, really, if\nthat’s your question. I’m not sure I answered your question.\nNEIL IRWIN. But in terms of timing or pacing of any additional easing.\nCHAIR POWELL. So we haven’t made—what we’d say about this was that after this\nmeeting, after the three recent rate cuts, we’re well positioned to address the risks that we face on\nboth sides of our dual mandate, and we’ll continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting\nbased on the incoming data implications for—and the implications for the outlook and the\nbalance of risks. Haven’t made any decisions about future meetings, but the economy is growing\nat a solid pace, the unemployment rate has been broadly stable, and inflation remains somewhat\nelevated. So we’ll be looking to our goal variables and letting the data light the way for us.\nPage 6 of 24\nJanuary 28, 2026 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMICHELLE SMITH. Steve.\nSTEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC. And sticking with questions you might\nanswer—thank you—you had previously, I believe, described the current policy rate being at the\nhigher end of neutral. And if you look at the longer run of the SEP and the longer-run rate, 16 of\n19 officials are actually below there on their long run. Is the Fed still in the process of bringing\nit down towards a middle range of neutral? And what would it take to get there?\nCHAIR POWELL. So I—the count I did was that 4 of the 19 were at or above that. And\nmaybe I missed by 1—I thought it was 4. And if you look at the dealer survey, it was 10 out of\n58 were at or above. So you’re right, it’s the high—higher end of the range. What we say is it’s\nwithin the range of plausible estimates. This is the higher end of that range, but it’s—so for\nsome people, I think, it’s neutral.\nI think—and many of my colleagues think—it’s hard to look at the incoming data and say\nthat policy’s significantly restrictive at this time. It may be—it may be sort of loosely neutral, or\nit may be somewhat restrictive. It’s in the eye of the beholder, and, of course, no one knows\nwith any precision. You’ve got a follow-up?\nSTEVE LIESMAN. I get what you’re saying, but I—some officials have described the\nFed being in a mode of bringing it down eventually, over time. Are you still in that mode, or is\nthis a place to hang out?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah, no, I would say, if you look at the SEP from December, you—\nmost people had additional normalization. But at the same time, we’ve done a lot of the process\nof normalizing. A good piece of it is done, with 75 basis points and, before that, 100. It’s\n175 basis points we’ve cut since we began cutting in September of 2024. So you’ve moved now\nto 3 point—fed funds is running just a little below 3.65 percent. So you’ve moved a good way,\nPage 7 of 24\nJanuary 28, 2026 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nand we think we’re well positioned here to watch how the economy performs, look at the data.\nWe’re not making decisions about future meetings, but we do think we’re well positioned after\nthose three cuts to let the data speak to us.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Amara.\nAMARA OMEOKWE. Thank you, Chair Powell. Amara Omeokwe from Bloomberg\nNews. To what extent did the Committee discuss the possibility of cutting at this meeting or in\nMarch? And how are you all thinking about the conditions that would merit another rate cut? Is\nthere broad agreement on the Committee about what it would take?\nCHAIR POWELL. So there was broad support on the Committee for holding today—\n“broad,” I would say, including among nonvoters. So that’s where that was. Of course, some\npeople did want to cut and dissented. But the Committee [was] pretty broadly for holding today.\nWe’re not trying to articulate a test for what—for when to next cut, or whether to cut at\nthe next meeting. What we’re saying is, we’re well positioned as we make decisions meeting by\nmeeting, looking at the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and all that. And we’re in a\nposition where we have to—we still have some tension between employment and inflation, but\nit’s less than it was. I think that the upside risks to inflation and the downside risks to\nemployment have probably both diminished a bit, so we’ll be looking at that. It’s about how you\nweigh the risks to the two goals and how big those—and quantify them. And so there are\ndifferent views on the Committee, and we’ll find our way forward as the data evolve.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Edward.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Edward Lawrence from Fox\nBusiness. Has the effects of tariffs already moved through the economy on prices?\nPage 8 of 24\nJanuary 28, 2026 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. A lot of it has. So, basically, there are many different estimates, and\nthey’re all highly uncertain. But most of the overrun in goods prices is from tariffs. And that’s\nactually good news, because if it weren’t from tariffs, it might mean it’s from demand, and that’s\na harder problem to solve. We do think tariffs are likely to move through and be a one-time\nprice increase. So most of the overshoot, if you were to take that out, you’d get—you would—I\nmean, inflation, core PCE inflation, is running just a bit above 2 percent ex the effects of tariffs\non goods. And the other good news is if you look away from goods and look at services, you do\nsee ongoing disinflation in all the categories of services. So that’s a healthy development.\nSo that’s what’s going on. The expectation is that we will see the effects of tariffs\nflowing through goods prices, peaking, and then starting to come down, assuming there are no\nnew major tariff increases that are begun. And that’s what we expect to see over the course of\nthis year. If we see that—if we see that, that would be something that tells us that we can—we\ncan loosen policy. Also, if we see something that suggests that the labor market is not\nstabilizing, that in fact it’s—the downside risks reemerge, or the data just get worse, we’d have\nto look at both of those. We have a two-sided mandate.\nEDWARD LAWRENCE. If I could—if President Trump does pick a new Fed Chairman\nbefore May, what does that look like? How would you work with that person, and what does\nthat transition period look like?\nCHAIR POWELL. I don’t have anything for you on that. I—that will depend on\nCongress’s actions and things I can’t speculate on.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Howard.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. Howard Schneider with Reuters. Thank you for taking our\nquestions. Given the changes in the statement and all you’ve said so far, is it fair to describe\nPage 9 of 24\nJanuary 28, 2026 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nrisks to your—to both sides of the mandate as roughly balanced right now? And is the next\nmove necessarily down?\nCHAIR POWELL. I’d say that the upside—again, the upside risks to inflation and the\ndownside risks to employment have diminished. But they still exist. So there’s still some\ntension between the mandates. Are they fully in balance? Hard to say. Hard to say. And we—\nagain, we think our policy is in a good place. I’ve just discussed reasons why we might change\nour policy, and we’ll just have to see how the data lead us.\nHOWARD SCHNEIDER. I’m wondering, a minute ago you said you felt expectations\nwere consistent with your—with your mandate, that the 2- and the 10-year breakevens have\nmoved quite notably in the last couple of weeks, I believe. Is there any concern on that front?\nCHAIR POWELL. I mean, I recently looked at all of the—both survey- and market-\nbased short-term inflation expectations have come way down. They were in a good place at the\nbeginning of last year, they spiked around Liberation Day, and now they’ve fully retraced in the\nlast few months. So that’s very comforting. In the longer term, inflation expectations have\nremained in places that are very consistent with 2 percent inflation over time. So expectations\nare—have been solid, and they reflect confidence in the return to 2 percent inflation.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Andrew.\nANDREW ACKERMAN. Apologies if this is a little bit repetitive, but in the past you’ve\nsaid that the reason you cut rates was that the risk to the labor market was greater than the risk to\nthe inflation side. Is that still true?\nCHAIR POWELL. We haven’t made—you’re right, we saw the labor market\nweakening, and we acted. And I think that was the appropriate thing to do. We have a—we will\nalways act to address what we see as the economy moving away from our goals. Risks to both of\nPage 10 of 24\nJanuary 28, 2026 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthe variables are a little less—I think that the upside risks to inflation, again, a little bit less, and\nthe downside risks to employment a little less. I just would say that I’m not making a judgment\nabout how one of them is more at risk than the other—just that the risks to both of them have\ndiminished.\nANDREW ACKERMAN. Okay. Thanks. BIS wrote a paper last summer which\nconcluded that global investors were hedging their dollar exposures, in ways that previously they\nhadn’t, because of policy uncertainty. Do you agree with BIS?\nCHAIR POWELL. We really don’t see much at all about that, that whole—that whole\nstory. There’s just not a lot of data that suggests that there’s much to that.\nANDREW ACKERMAN. Thanks.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Ana.\nANA SWANSON. Ana Swanson with the New York Times. Can you talk more about\nwhat you would need to see in the labor market to conclude it’s time to resume easing? Do you\nneed to see further deterioration on the labor market, or would it be enough for inflation to\nsoften?\nCHAIR POWELL. So we’ll always be looking at both things, and so there could be\ncombinations, infinite numbers of combinations, that would cause us to want to move. Certainly,\na weakening labor market would be an argument for loosening. But what’s happening with\ninflation? If inflation were at the same time getting worse, you just have a very difficult situation\nthere. So we’ll be looking at both. Clearly, a weakening labor market calls for cutting; a\nstronger labor market says that the rates are in a good place. We’ll have to be making similar\njudgments, too, on inflation, though.\nPage 11 of 24\nJanuary 28, 2026 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nANA SWANSON. And if inflation does pick back up and the labor market doesn’t show\nfurther signs of deterioration, is there a chance that you could raise rates, rather than simply\nremaining on hold? What would you need to see to consider hiking?\nCHAIR POWELL. We don’t take things off the table, but it isn’t anybody’s base case\nright now—anybody’s base case—that the next move will be a rate hike. But, ultimately, we’ll\ndo what we think is the right thing. But that’s not where people’s expectations are right now.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Victoria.\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Hi. Victoria Guida with Politico. I wanted to ask, you’ve talked in\nthe past about concerns about the U.S. fiscal trajectory, and we’ve seen in the Japanese bond\nmarket a lot of turmoil recently, in part due to concerns over their fiscal and long-term economic\noutlook. So do you worry that the U.S. could, at some point, find itself in a similar situation to\nJapan, whether for fiscal or demographic reasons?\nCHAIR POWELL. Over time, you’ve seen that U.S. rates have remained pretty—they\nhaven’t moved a lot, really for a while. But they haven’t moved a lot because of what’s been\nhappening in Japan. So it’s more of an “over time” thing. The U.S. federal budget deficit is\nuncontroversially on an unsustainable path. The level of debt is not unsustainable—it’s very\nmuch sustainable—but the path is unsustainable. And the sooner we work on it, the better. But\nright now we’re running a very large deficit at essentially full employment, and so the fiscal\npicture needs to be addressed. And it’s not really being addressed. So that’s important. I’m not\nin any way connecting it to some sort of near-term market event. But, ultimately, it’s something\nwe’ll have to deal with. In the end—in the endgame, that’s where you wind up is in some kind\nof a difficult thing. But that’s not where we are—it’s not where Japan is, either—but it’s\ncertainly not where we are right now.\nPage 12 of 24\nJanuary 28, 2026 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Does it reduce the effect of your rate cuts that longer-term rates\nhave overall not really budged that much?\nCHAIR POWELL. I wouldn’t say that. The thing is—I mean, technically, higher\nlonger-term rates means less economic financial conditions. But remember—many, many things\nmove longer-term rates. It’s not—and it’s not mostly what happens on the short end. There can\nbe effects of longer-term rates from our moving our policy around, but it’s much more\nassessments of the fiscal path, and fiscal policies, and risks and things like that that move the 10-\nyear around. You can look back and find periods where we’ve been very actively moving the\npolicy rate over the course of a year, and over the course of that year, the 10-year is exactly\nwhere it started. So it’s not—there’s not a tight link between 10-year rates and the overnight\nrate.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Elizabeth.\nELIZABETH SCHULZE. Thanks so much. Elizabeth Schulze with ABC News.\nRepublican Senator Thom Tillis, who sits on the Senate Banking Committee, said he will block\nany Fed nominee, including the Chair, until this investigation into you is resolved. Do you\nsupport this move by the senator, and what conversations have you had with the senator?\nCHAIR POWELL. I’ve got nothing for you on that.\nELIZABETH SCHULZE. More broadly, what would happen to American households if\nthe Federal Reserve loses its ability to operate independent from politics?\nCHAIR POWELL. So, really, the point of independence is not to protect policymakers\nor anything like that. It just is that every advanced-economy democracy in the world has come\naround to this common practice. It’s just an institutional arrangement that is—that has served the\npeople well. And that is to have a separation between—to not have direct elected official control\nPage 13 of 24\nJanuary 28, 2026 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nover the setting of monetary policy. And the reason is that monetary policy can be used through\nan election cycle to affect the economy in a way that will be politically worthwhile. So this\nisn’t—I’m not talking about the U.S. context, this is every advanced-economy democracy of any\nsize. So it’s a good practice, it’s pretty much everywhere among countries that look at all like\nthe United States. And I think if you lose that, it’s—first of all, it would be hard to restore the\ncredibility of the institution. If people lose their faith that we’re making decisions only on the\nbasis of our assessment of what’s best for everyone, for the wide public, rather than trying to\nbenefit one group or another—if you lose that, it’s going to be hard to retain it. And we haven’t\nlost it. I don’t believe we will. I certainly hope we won’t. But it’s very important, and the\nreason it’s important is that it’s enabled central banks, generally, not to be perfect, but to serve\nthe public well.\nELIZABETH SCHULZE. You’re confident it can maintain that independence at this\npoint?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yes. I mean, I’m strongly committed to that, and so are my\ncolleagues.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Archie.\nARCHIE HALL. Archie Hall from the Economist. On that sort of stabilization of the\nlabor market question, how much do you see the weakening we saw over the past six months,\nyear, as a kind of data mirage around immigration, the government shutdown, and so on, that’s\nnow resolved? Or how much have we seen a kind of real underlying firming up in the state of\nthe labor market, do you think?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, part of it is, to your point, part of it just is that, that labor\nsupply—growth in labor supply has come to essentially a halt from a fairly fast clip of growth\nPage 14 of 24\nJanuary 28, 2026 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nover the last couple of years driven by immigration, and then the halt being driven by a very\nsudden stop in immigration. So, many outcomes were possible with that. Supply came way\ndown. It turns out that demand for labor also came down a very similar amount, maybe just a\nlittle bit more, which is why the unemployment rate has gone up. So I don’t know whether that’s\na coincidence or not, but that’s what’s happened with that part.\nBut if you look at other things, like, for example, the—just to pick a couple—the\nConference Board’s measure of job availability that came out, I don’t know, was it yesterday or\ntoday? But it shows—it’s a survey showing that workers feel like job availability is—it’s a very\nlow reading. Just one reading, but it’s an indication of softening. People—part-time for\neconomic reasons, which is a category within the broader U-6 category measure, has moved up\nsignificantly. So there are lots of—and I could go on and on—there are lots of little places that\nsuggest that the labor market has softened. But part of—but you’re right, part of payroll job\nsoftening is that both the supply and demand for labor has, has come down—growth in those two\nhave come down. So that makes it a difficult time to read the labor market. So imagine they\nboth came down a lot, to the point where there is no job growth. Is that full employment? In a\nsense it is. If demand and supply are in—are in balance, you could say that’s full employment.\nAt the same time, is it—do we really feel like that’s, that’s a maximum-employment economy?\nIt’s a challenging—it’s a very challenging and quite unusual situation.\nARCHIE HALL. Thanks. And one more—on growth and the kind of strong growth\noutlook or strengthening growth outlook you’re now seeing, how much of that is the fiscal\nstimulus we’re seeing from the Beautiful Bill, the tax cuts, and all that?\nCHAIR POWELL. So you’re seeing it already. You don’t have much of a fiscal—I\nthink the outlook, you’re right, it’s financial conditions and it’s fiscal policy for ’26. But you’ve\nPage 15 of 24\nJanuary 28, 2026 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ngot strong consumption that’s been happening before financial conditions have been supportive\nbut before the fiscal effects really are shown. So essentially the economy has, once again,\nsurprised us with its strength—not for the first time. Consumer spending, although it’s, it’s\nuneven across income categories, but consumer spending overall numbers are good. And we’re\nbenefiting from the—from the AI buildout of data centers—that’s another thing we’re benefiting\nfrom. But the economy, overall, growth is—growth is on solid footing, it looks like. And it’s\nnot just those things. It’s just that consumers—the consumer is filling out surveys that sound\nreally negative and then spending. So there’s been a disconnect for some time between\ndownbeat surveys and reasonably good spending data.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Christine.\nCHRISTINE ROMANS. Thanks, Chair Powell. Christine Romans from NBC News.\nYou talked about how consumer spending is uneven. The President calls inflation “defeated”\nand “solved.” The FOMC says it’s a “somewhat elevated” inflation. But you talked about those\ncustomer survey—or those consumer sentiment surveys and public opinion polls that show that\nmost families say the cost of living is still issue number one. What is the conversation around\nthe table with your colleagues about how wealthier consumers seem to be driving so much of the\neconomy, and why so many families still feel like they just can’t make ends meet after five years\nof rising prices? What is that discussion like?\nCHAIR POWELL. So a couple things. One, there’s something, something to it in that\nwe know that higher-income households tend to own real estate and tend to own stocks, stocks\nand securities, and those assets have been going up in value, and increases in wealth do support\nspending over time, so—and that’s clearly a part of the story. We also know that for some time\nnow, for a year or more, we’ve been hearing from retailers, for example, that serve lower-income\nPage 16 of 24\nJanuary 28, 2026 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\ncustomers, whether it be food or the big-box stores or any—they’re saying the same thing, which\nis, “Our consumers are looking to economize. They’re trading down from brands, and they’re\nbuying less and changing their buying habits and that kind of thing.” So we’re seeing that, and\nthat’s—that is a reality of what we’re seeing. They’re still consuming, but they’re feeling it in a\ndifferent way.\nI would say more broadly, on affordability, we have a vast network through the Reserve\nBanks, and also through the Board of Governors, where we talk to small and large businesses\nand households. So we do hear a lot about affordability, and we take—we take that very\nseriously. And we take it to heart because our job is—one of our jobs is price stability, and so\nthe best thing we can do for people who are feeling that squeeze is to keep inflation under control\nand, frankly, to finish the job of getting inflation back down to 2 percent.\nCHRISTINE ROMANS. You mentioned the AI buildout as being positive for economic\ngrowth this year. I wonder as you look at the weakest year—last year—for job creation of a\nnonrecession year since, like, 2003, are you concerned about AI maybe supplanting more entry-\nlevel work and entry-level jobs? And how does that play into your—what you’re watching about\nthe labor market?\nCHAIR POWELL. So everyone, of course, is watching AI and the deployment and\ntrying to understand exactly what’s happening, and there’s a wide range of possibilities. It’s\nhard to say, and of course anyone who uses it is amazed at what it can accomplish, right? So\nevery technological wave will eliminate some jobs and create other jobs, and it’s always been the\ncase. If you look back, wave after wave after wave, there will be some disruption, but ultimately\ntechnology increases productivity, which is the basis for rising wages. And it may not all happen\nimmediately, but over time it’s what—it’s what enables incomes to rise over time is rising\nPage 17 of 24\nJanuary 28, 2026 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nproductivity. And we always ask, well this is going to be different, is it going to be different?\nAnd we don’t know. And we may, in any case, see, in the short term, jobs that are being\neliminated by the capabilities of AI. We may see that. We just don’t know what the overall\neffect is going to be.\nSo how to think about it—in macroeconomic terms, it’s very hard. We can look at the\naggregate data. We can analyze, for example—there is some connection, it appears, between the\nlow hiring rate for recent college grads and AI, but it’s not the main, or only, driver. You hear\nlarge companies, though, saying—many of them saying—that they either won’t be hiring for\nsome time, or that they’re hiring less, or that they’re laying people off, and they tend to refer to\nAI when they do that. So we’re all watching and learning, and it could—it could certainly have\npretty significant effects on the economy, the workforce, and our society. We don’t really have\nthe tools to address the concerns that may arise. But we have a lot of people who focus on\nanalyzing it and try to—try to understand what the macroeconomic implications are, which is our\njob.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Beiyi.\nBEIYI SEOW. Thank you, Chair Powell. Beiyi from AFP News Agency. You\nmentioned earlier that on inflation, the broad expectation was for a one-time price increase and\nthen for inflation to come down. I was wondering, is your expectation still for inflation to start\ncooling in the second half of 2026? And if you could elaborate how far we are from target\ncurrently. Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. So how far we are from target is, as I mentioned in my opening\nremarks, we’re—we had 3 percent—3.0 percent core PCE inflation over the 12 months ending in\nDecember. And that’s pretty much what we had the year before. So, on net, no progress. But\nPage 18 of 24\nJanuary 28, 2026 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nthe story behind that is modestly positive in that most of the overshoot was in goods prices,\nwhich we think is related to tariffs, and ultimately we think those will not result in inflation, as\nopposed to a one-time price increase. Okay, so that’s where it is.\nIn terms of, you asked—so no one thinks they will, ex ante, understand really clearly,\nprecisely when this will happen. But there’s an expectation that sometime in the middle quarters\nof the year, we’ll see tariff inflation topping out. So what we do is, we—when a tariff is put in\nplace, we track the effect of those tariffs over a six-, seven-, eight-, nine-month period, and you\ncan see—and then you can see for that tariff how long it takes to reach a place where it’s affected\nthe price level and that’s it. So we’re getting better at that, and our estimate is that it’ll be\nsometime in the middle of the year, but I wouldn’t look for great precision in that. But we’ll be\nable to see whether things are moving in that direction. I think we’ll be able to see.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Richard Escobedo.\nRICHARD ESCOBEDO. Thanks, Chair Powell. I’m Richard Escobedo with CBS\nNews. I want to look outside the U.S. about what’s happening outside our shores and how it\nimpacts the U.S. Canada’s prime minister said last week that there’s been a “rupture in the\nglobal order,” and I wonder how you’re thinking about geopolitical risk as it relates to the U.S.\neconomy.\nCHAIR POWELL. So I can’t—I can’t comment on that speech or statement or anything\nlike that. Geopolitical risk for us is—a lot of it is around energy, oil. And so far we haven’t—\nfor all the turmoil, we really—oil prices have come down, as you know, and so we don’t really\nsee much. Longer than that, it’s trade, and the trade—the economy—our economy has pulled\nthrough pretty well, you’d have to say, given the very significant changes in trade policy. The\nU.S. economy has, has pushed right through. Partly that is—that the way that what was\nPage 19 of 24\nJanuary 28, 2026 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nimplemented was significantly less than what was announced at the beginning. In addition, other\ncountries didn’t retaliate, and, in addition, a good part of it hasn’t been passed through to\nconsumers yet. It’s being—it’s being taken by companies that stand between the consumer and\nthe exporter. So that’s where that is.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Jennifer.\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. Thank you, Chair Powell. Jennifer Schonberger with\nYahoo Finance. With third-quarter GDP growing at 4.4 percent and the fourth quarter expected\nto have a five handle on it, as to what the Atlanta Fed is predicting, at a time when you had a\ngovernment shutdown and we thought that was going to shave off some growth. You’ve also got\nthe fiscal tailwinds, you’ve talked about big tax refunds coming, potential tariff dividend. How\ncould you cut rates and not spur inflation in that environment?\nCHAIR POWELL. Well, we didn’t cut rates today. But it depends on how fast potential\noutput is growing, right? I’m just asking in principle. I’m not—I’m not saying this is what’s\nhappening. There’s growth, and there’s how fast the potential is growing. And in a time of high\nproductivity growth, potential output is rising. So it really matters whether potential output is\ngrowing as fast as actual output. And it would matter over time. The numbers you cite were for\nquarters, and quarterly GDP is—you need to look at 12 months, because quarterly GDP can be\nvery lumpy. Quarterly GDP [growth] was negative in the first quarter last year. So the overall—\nover the year, the numbers were nothing like that. It was more in the mid-2s for the year.\nJENNIFER SCHONBERGER. And how do you explain the divide right now between\nstrong economic growth and the job market? Is it productivity that’s filling the gap? And is\nproductivity being driven by AI at this point?\nPage 20 of 24\nJanuary 28, 2026 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. So we—there has—you’re right, there has been a divide of solid\ngrowth but what looked like a weakening labor market, and that can be explained by rising\nproductivity. But I would say we do see signs, certainly, of the unemployment rate stabilizing.\nSo it may be we’re seeing the beginning of the resolution of those two things. Also, as you\nprobably know, the lore is that when GDP and the labor market get into an argument, in the end,\nlabor market is more—the labor market data is more reliable. GDP data is very hard to collect\nand understand. But, nonetheless, I think we may be seeing that tension resolving a little bit—\ntoo soon to say with any confidence, though.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Matt Egan.\nMATT EGAN. Matt Egan with CNN. Chair Powell, after today you have two meetings\nleft as Fed Chair. You’ve obviously experienced a lot during your time as Fed Chair, served\nunder multiple Presidents. I’m wondering what advice you have for whoever your successor\nmight be.\nCHAIR POWELL. Honestly, I’d say a couple things. One is stay out of elected politics.\nDon’t get pulled into elected politics. Don’t do it. That’s another thing. Another is that our\nwindow into democratic accountability is Congress. And it’s not a passive burden for us to go to\nCongress and talk to people. It’s an affirmative, regular obligation. If you want democratic\nlegitimacy, you earn it by your interactions with our elected overseers. And so it’s something\nyou need to work hard at, and I have worked hard at it. And the last thing is, it’s easy to—it’s\neasy to criticize government institutions in so many ways. I will tell whoever it is, you’re about\nto meet the most qualified group of people you not only have ever worked with [but also that]\nyou will ever work with, when you meet Fed staff. And not everybody’s perfect, but there isn’t a\nbetter cadre of professionals more dedicated to the public well-being than work at the Fed.\nPage 21 of 24\nJanuary 28, 2026 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nMATT EGAN. Thanks for that answer. If I may follow up—as I’m sure you’ve noticed,\ngold and silver prices have experienced historic gains of late. And I’m wondering how much\nattention, if any, you pay to those moves, and what message you may take from these significant\nprice increases we’ve seen for precious metals.\nCHAIR POWELL. Don’t take much message macroeconomically. The argument can be\nmade that we’re losing credibility or something—it’s simply not the case. If you look—if you\nlook at where inflation expectations are, our credibility is right where it needs to be. So we look\nat those things, we don’t get spun up over particular asset price changes, although we do monitor\nthem, of course.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Nicole for the last question.\nNICOLE GOODKIND. Hi. Nicole Goodkind, Barron’s. Some prominent critics have\ncharged that the Fed’s economic models are somewhat backward looking but should be more\nforward looking, incorporating things like productivity increases from AI. How do you\nincorporate current and future developments into your analysis and decisionmaking, and do you\nhave an answer to those critics?\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah, so by and large, those criticisms, as somebody on the inside—\nthey just don’t make sense, and I’ll tell you why. Every FOMC participant writes down a\nforecast every quarter, right? The Summary of Economic Projections. And that’s the basis for\nhow we think about the economy. And the other thing is, what an economic model can do is it\ncan grind up all the data for the last number of years, 50 years let’s say, and it can—it can\nidentify what are the relationships between variables A, B, C, D, and all that kind of thing. And\nit can tell you if you change one of those variables, this is what should happen in the\nmacroeconomy. That’s just the way it works. However, the structure of the macroeconomy is\nPage 22 of 24\nJanuary 28, 2026 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nconstantly changing. For example, we hadn’t had a pandemic in 100 years. It wasn’t in the\nmodel. And we knew it from the very beginning—it was not in the model. A trade war of this\nscope—we’d never had that in 100 years. And so there’s great uncertainty at different points.\nAnother thing I’ll say is, when it comes to technological developments that raise potential\noutput, some kind of technological revolution like happened in the ’90s here and like may be\nhappening now with AI—we’re all over that. Everyone studies those periods, and we’re very\nclear-eyed about the possibility that this higher productivity may persist, and also that it may not.\nWe’re not—no one’s sitting here unaware of the possibility of higher productivity. We’ve been\ntalking about it for three years. It long predates the current situation—it’s been going on for five\nor six years we’ve had productivity higher. We’ve been talking about it that whole time. So it’s\nvery much on our minds. And we are well aware that higher productivity means higher potential\noutput, and it changes the way you think about, potentially, inflation growth, labor market, and\nall those things. That’s all in our models. I mean, if it’s a question of using better models, bring\nthem on. Where are they? We’ll take them. But I think we certainly are in contact with\nanybody who does economic modeling, and we’re always looking to do better at that. But that’s\nhow I think about that.\nNICOLE GOODKIND. And just a quick follow-up: We’ve been talking a lot about\ntariffs passing through, and we’ve been talking a lot about them for the past few months. The\ntrade landscape is still in a constant state of flux. Announcements, threats, negotiations—they’re\nall frequently changing. So I’m wondering how you actually track these. How—what data or\nchannels are most critical to follow this in real time?\nCHAIR POWELL. Trade?\nNICOLE GOODKIND. Yeah, the impact of tariffs and how they’re changing.\nPage 23 of 24\nJanuary 28, 2026 Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL\nCHAIR POWELL. Yeah, I think our staff has done a really nice job on that, and they\nkind of put it together in real time. So as I mentioned, a tariff gets put in place, you can pretty\nmuch track its effects on pricing and on everything. And so you build a model up from all of\nthe—all of the tariffs. At the beginning, it was very much of a forecast; now, it’s—every, every\ncycle that goes by, it becomes more informed by actual data. And we were—we—our forecasts\nwere not far off. What changed was, as I think I said earlier, what changed was what was\nimplemented was smaller than what was announced. In addition, we didn’t see retaliation\ninternationally, and I think people did generally expect that because we saw that in the past. And\nthat really mattered too. And then the other thing is the pass-through—didn’t know how fast that\nwas going to be to consumers, didn’t know how much exporters would take, how much\ncompanies in the middle would take, and how much the consumer would take. And it turns out\nit’s a lot of companies in the middle—who, by the way, are pretty strongly committed to passing\nthe rest of it through, which is one of the reasons why we need to keep our eye on inflation and\nnot declare victory prematurely.\nMICHELLE SMITH. Thank you.\nCHAIR POWELL. We’re done?\nMICHELLE SMITH. We’re done.\nCHAIR POWELL. Okay. Thank you very much.\nPage 24 of 24"
